["Question: Does functional status predict complicated clinical course in older adults in the emergency department with infection??\nContext 1: To identify the relationship between functional status and complicated clinical course in older adults in the emergency department (ED) with suspected infection and to identify other independent predictors of complicated clinical course.\nContext 2: Functional status was obtained using the Older Americans Resources Scale (OARS). Complicated clinical course was defined as in-hospital mortality, need for intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, or worsening in sepsis criteria within 48\u00a0hours. Analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression.\nContext 3: The objective was to determine whether prior statin use is associated with lower mortality in emergency patients admitted with infection", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess the role of apolipoprotein (apo) E in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in vivo.\nContext 2: During atherogenesis, macrophages migrate into the subendothelial space where they ingest deposited lipoproteins, accumulate lipids, and transform into foam cells. It is unclear why these macrophages do not remove their lipid loads from the region. This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that macrophage behavior is altered when membrane cholesterol levels are elevated, as might be the case for cells in contact with lipoproteins within atherosclerotic lesions.\nContext 3: Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is a multifunctional, extracellular lipid transport protein that plays a major role in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis. Recent in vivo studies suggested that unlike systemic PLTP, macrophage-derived PLTP would be antiatherogenic. The present study aimed at characterizing the atheroprotective properties of macrophage-derived PLTP.\nContext 4: ApoE exerts an antiatherosclerotic activity by regulating lipoprotein metabolism and promoting cell cholesterol efflux. We discriminated between macrophage and systemic apoE contribution using an assay of macrophage RCT in mice. The complete absence of apoE lead to an overall impairment of the process and, similarly, the absence of apoE exclusively in macrophages resulted in the reduction of cholesterol mobilization from macrophages to plasma, liver, and feces. Conversely, expression of apoE in macrophages is sufficient to promote normal RCT even in apoE-deficient mice. The mechanisms accounting for these results were investigated by evaluating the first step of RCT (ie, cholesterol efflux from cells). Macrophages isolated from apoE-deficient mice showed a reduced ability to release cholesterol into the culture medium, whereas the apoB-depleted plasma from apoE-deficient and healthy mice possessed a similar capacity to promote cellular lipid release from cultured macrophages.\nContext 5: Apolipoprotein CI (apoCI) is expressed in the liver and in macrophages, and has several roles in lipid metabolism. Since macrophage apoCI expression might affect macrophage lipid homeostasis and atherosclerotic lesion development locally in the arterial wall, we investigated the effect of both systemic and macrophage apoCI on atherosclerotic lesion development.\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that macrophage-derived PLTP is antiatherogenic and that apoE is not required for this effect. The mechanisms underlying this effect are not fully understood, but may involve the regulation of macrophage lipid metabolism and the promotion of cholesterol efflux from macrophages to the plasma.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAtherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and inflammatory cells in the arterial wall. The accumulation of lipids and inflammatory cells is a consequence of the impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) of lipoproteins from macrophages to the plasma. The RCT process is initiated by the uptake of lipoproteins by macrophages, followed by the release of", "Question: Does foam during reconstitution affect the potency of botulinum toxin type A??\nExplanation: The potency of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) is reduced when it is reconstituted in the presence of foam. This is because the foam may cause surface denaturation of the toxin. The potency of Botox is reduced by 50% when the reconstituted solution is stored at 4 degrees C for 24 hours.

One hundred and twenty patients were prospectively randomized to receive no drain, closed suction drains or drains designed for re-transfusion of shed blood. Blood loss, VAS pain scores, thigh swelling, hematoma formation, number of dressings changed and hospital stay were compared and patients followed for 3 months.\nThe results showed that there was no significant difference in the amount of blood loss between the three groups", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of the study was too determine whether, in a low-dose aspirin trial in high-risk pregnancies, a decrease in maternal serum thromboxane B2 level predicted improved pregnancy outcomes.\nContext 2: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial included 2539 women, 1010 of whom had sufficient serum samples at enrollment and at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation, 34 to 38 weeks' gestation, or both to assess longitudinal changes in thromboxane B2 level and their effects on pregnancy outcomes. Women were randomly assigned between 13 and 26 weeks' gestation to receive daily aspirin (60 mg) or placebo.\nContext 3: Overall and in all subgroups women assigned to receive aspirin had markedly lower maternal thromboxane B2 concentration values than did those assigned to receive a placebo (P =.0001). Changes in thromboxane levels were not, however, correlated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Women with >/=50% reduction in maternal serum thromboxane B2 concentrations from baseline had occurrences of preeclampsia (P =.922), preterm birth (P =.375), small for gestational age neonates (P =.938), and grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage (P = 1.000) similar to those of women who had <50% reduction. Similar results were found for women with thromboxane B2 level decreases of <15 versus >15 ng/mL and women with thromboxane B2 level decreases to <10 versus >/=10, <5 versus >/=5, and <1 versus >/=1 ng/mL. Maternal thromboxane B2 concentrations at enrollment were also not predictive of adverse outcomes.\nContext 4: We performed a secondary analysis of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network randomized controlled trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk women. Serum biomarker levels at enrollment (before initiation of aspirin or placebo) were compared between women who did and did not develop preeclampsia, both for the group as a whole and within each of 4 high-risk groups (insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, multiple gestation, and previous preeclampsia) using a regression model adjusting for gestational age at collection and prepregnancy body mass index.\nContext 5: This study was conducted to assess the thromboxane (TX) dependence of biochemical and clinical outcomes in women with preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia were randomized to receive either aspirin (100 mg/d) or placebo. TXB2 levels were measured at enrollment, 24 to 28 weeks' gestation, and 34 to 38 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome was the occurrence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of preterm birth, small for gestational age, and grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage.\nContext 6: The primary outcome was the occurrence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of preterm birth, small for gestational age, and grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage.\nContext", "Yes, a critical assessment of cross-species detection of gene duplicate using comparative", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We have previously reported that a one-year school-based exercise intervention program influences the accrual of bone mineral in pre-pubertal girls. This report aims to evaluate if also hip structure is affected, as geometry independent of bone mineral influences fracture risk.\nContext 2: Walking and cycling to school are one source of regular physical activity. The aim of this two years observational study in pre-pubertal children was to evaluate if walking and cycling to school was associated with higher total amount of physical activity and larger gain in bone mineral content (BMC) and bone width than when going by car or bus.\nContext 3: 133 boys and 99 girls aged 7-9 years were recruited to the Malm\u00f6 Prospective Paediatric Osteoporosis Prevention (POP) study. BMC (g) was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in total body, lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck (FN) at baseline and after 24 months. Bone width was measured in L2-L4 and FN. Skeletal changes in the 57 boys and 48 girls who consistently walked or cycled to school were compared with the 24 boys and 17 girls who consistently went by bus or car. All children remained in Tanner stage I. Level of everyday physical activity was estimated by accelerometers worn for four consecutive days and questionnaires. Comparisons were made by independent student's t-tests between means and Fisher's exact tests. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust for group differences in age at baseline, duration of organized physical activity, annual changes in length and BMC or bone width if there were differences in these traits at baseline.\nContext 4: It is known that physical activity during growth has a positive influence on bone mineral accrual, and is thus possibly one strategy to prevent osteoporosis. However, as bone geometry, independent of areal bone mineral density (aBMD), influences fracture risk, this study aimed to evaluate whether hip structure in pre-pubertal girls is also affected by a two-year exercise intervention program.\nContext 5: To examine how cumulative teenage sports histories and time-averaged teenage calcium intake are related to total body bone mineral gain between ages 12 and 18 years and to proximal femur bone mineral density (BMD) at age 18 years. Design. Longitudinal. Setting. University Hospital and local suburban community in Central Pennsylvania.\n\nBased on the results of the previous study, we hypothesized that the girls who walked or cycled to school would have higher total amount of physical activity and larger gain in bone mineral content (BMC) and bone width than when going by car or bus. The aim of this two years observational study in pre-pubertal children was to evaluate if walking and cycling to school was associated with higher total amount of physical activity and larger gain in bone mineral content (BMC) and bone width than when going by car or bus.\n\nThe study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.

Children with hot beverage injuries were significantly younger (18.2 months; IQR 14.1, 27.8) than those suffering starch scald injuries (51.4 months; 18.7, 102.3; p<0.001). Perineal burns were more common in the starch group than the hot beverage scald group (10.9% vs. 2.4%, p<0.001). Chest/breast and abdominal burns were more common in the hot beverage group than the starch group (60.7% vs. 36.9%, p<0.001). Children under three years of age in both groups are significantly less likely to receive adequate first aid at the scene (p<0.001). There are no differences in the need for skin grafting or scar management when comparing hot beverage scalds and scalds caused by starchy liquids.\nContext 2: To characterise children presenting with hot beverage scalds versus scalds caused by starchy water.\nContext 3: Twenty-seven studies were identified, mostly from India. Burns were more common among males at younger ages (0-12 years) and among females from adolescence onward (>14 years). Flame-related burns and scalds accounted for over 80% of burns in most cases, and were the most common types of injuries observed among children and women with most burns occurring in the home. Electrical burns occurred mostly among men. Important risk factors for burns included low socioeconomic status, being younger, wearing loose, flammable clothing and the use of kerosene. Data on care-seeking and treatment were limited.\nContext 4: We retrospectively reviewed Burn Registry Data from a large Children's Hospital Burn Unit from January 2005 through August 2005 for inpatients with partial-thickness burns treated with Aquacel Ag. A comparison group was composed of patients from the same period the previous year treated with silver sulfadiazine cream (SSD, Par Pharmaceuticals, Woodcliff, NJ) and matched for age and %TBSA burned. Patients with inhalation injury or full-thickness burns were excluded. Intent-to-treat analysis was limited to patients with less than 22% TBSA burn. Direct costs and total charges were compared statistically after log transformation due to the skewedness of the data.\nContext 5: Animals received a 60% total body surface area (TBSA) burn. The burn was divided into 3 zones: 1) the head and neck, 2) the trunk, and 3) the extremities. The animals were treated with either Aquacel Ag or SSD.

Genes previously implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes are obvious candidates in this respect. In this study, we focussed on exons 8-10 of the HNF1A gene since rare, penetrant mutations in these exons (which are only transcribed in selected HNF1A isoforms) are associated with a later age of diagnosis of Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) than mutations in exons 1-7. The age of diagnosis in the subgroup of HNF1A-MODY individuals with exon 8-10 mutations overlaps with that of early multifactorial T2D, and we set out to test the hypothesis that these exons might also harbour low-frequency coding variants of intermediate penetrance that contribute to risk of multifactorial T2D.\nContext 2: Twelve patients with diabetes in 2-to-3 generations, all diagnosed before age 31, were screened for mutations and deletions in HNF1A, HNF4A, INS, IPF1, NEUROD1 and GCK genes by Sanger sequencing and by Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay.\nContext 3: Two recent genome-wide association studies have identified several novel type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants in intron 15 of the KCNQ1 gene. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the variants in KCNQ1 on type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits in the population of mainland China.\nContext 4: A genome-wide association study recently identified an association between common variants, rs1535435 and rs9494266, in the AHI1 gene and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the putative association between these polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes or type 2 diabetes-related metabolic traits in Danish individuals.\nContext 5: NEUROD1 encodes a transcription factor expressed in the endocrine pancreas, and involved in beta-cell development, function and mechanisms of apoptosis.

Translocation of endotoxin has been recognized as a fatal complication leading to liver failure. After extended hepatectomy, the portal hypertension, mucosal damage, intrahepatic bile acid retention, inhibited enterokinesia, and so forth are likely to contribute to enhanced endotoxin absorption. The effect of selective bowel decontamination (SBD) on the prognosis of hepatectomy were investigated.\nContext 2: Twenty rats were included in this study. The animals received either a standard housing protocol or were subjected to a Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) stress paradigm. All rats underwent a 70\u00a0% partial hepatectomy (PHx). The animals were evaluated on postoperative day 2 or 4. Blood samples were collected to examine circulating markers of inflammation and liver cell damage. Additionally, liver tissues were sampled to evaluate liver weight and regeneration rate.\nContext 3: A terminal loop ileostomy was applied in rats. Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) of either the small bowel or the colon was performed. After 3 days of SDD, severe ANP was induced. At 24 hours, bacterial translocation was assessed by cultures of bowel mucosa, mesenteric lymph nodes, and pancreas using a scoring system (0-4).\nContext 4: We adopted rat models of partial hepatectomy (70%, PHx) and subtotal hepatectomy (90%, SHx), gentamicin or saline of the same amount was administrated preoperatively. Liver damage makers, portal and systemic lipopolysaccharide, mucosal damage, signaling pathways, liver regeneration, and bile canalicular networks reconstruction were investigated.\nContext 5: After institutional review board approval, 20 adult Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into 2 groups of 10 animals each. Mechanical bowel preparation including sodium phosphate was performed on the experimental group via a feeding tube, whereas no bowel preparation procedures were performed on the control group. Transverse colon resection and anastomosis were performed on all rats under general anaesthesia. On postoperative day 5, re-laparotomy was performed and the anastomotic areas were resected. Animals were killed, after which bursting pressure and tissue hydroxyproline concentrations were measured, histopathological examination was performed, and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) was assessed.\nContext 6: The rats were divided into 2 groups of 10 animals each. The rats in the control group were fed with a normal diet, whereas the rats in the experimental group were fed with a diet containing 0.5\u00a0% of the total diet as a source of LPS.

This has yet to be reported for chondrosarcoma of bone. This information should be of interest to the clinician and helpful in counseling patients with chondrosarcoma.\nContext 2: The estimated survival for all grades of local/regional chondrosarcoma improved from baseline with each year of survival after diagnosis. At 5 years after diagnosis, local/regional Grade 1 chondrosarcoma displayed higher conditional survival than Grade 2 and 3 local/regional chondrosarcoma (97.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 95.2%-98.4%] versus 92.8% [95% CI, 89.5%-95.0%], p = 0.006 and 83.8% [95% CI, 69.9%-91.7%], p = 0.012). Estimated survival improved from baseline with each year of survival for all grades of metastatic chondrosarcoma. Conditional survival estimates for Grade 3 axial tumors failed to improve from baseline to 5 years after diagnosis (52.9% versus 70.2%, p > 0.05) compared with Grade 3 extremity tumors at baseline and 5 years after diagnosis (58.1% versus 95.8%, p < 0.0001) The 20-year conditional survival estimates reveal that a cancer-specific risk of mortality exists even 10 years after diagnosis, suggesting that although the conditional survival increases considerably over time, it cannot be considered cured.\nContext 3: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database maintained by the National Cancer Institute to identify 2138 patients with chondrosarcoma of bone from 1973 to 2009. We used an actuarial life table analysis to explore differences in 5-year cause-specific survival estimates conditional on 1 to 5 years of survival. The cohort was stratified by grade, location (axial versus extremity), use of radiation, and age. Finally, we expanded the analysis to include survival estimates 20 years after diagnosis conditional on survival for 5 and 10 years.\nContext 4: Our questions include the following: (1) Does the conditional survival of patients with local/regional chondrosarcoma improve with each additional year of survival?

Neutrophils, except unactivated control cells, were activated with 10 \u03bcg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cells were cultured with a range of different concentrations of the A. annua extracts (400-1 \u03bcg/mL) and artemisinin (200 and 100 \u03bcg/mL) and the supernatants were then tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and PGE2. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Positive controls with an inhibitor were assayed in triplicate: chloroquine 2.58 and 5.16 \u03bcg/mL for TNF-\u03b1, and ibuprofen 400 \u03bcg/mL for PGE2. An unsupplemented group was also assessed in triplicate as a baseline control.\nContext 3: Neutrophils were stimulated to an inflammatory state by the addition of LPS. A. annua extract significantly inhibited TNF-\u03b1 production by activated neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner. There was complete inhibition by the A. annua extract at 200, 100, and 50 \u03bcg/mL (all P\u22640.0003). At A. annua extract concentrations of 25, 10, and 5 \u03bcg/mL, TNF-\u03b1 production was inhibited by 89% (P<0.0001), 54% (P=0.0002), and 38% (P=0.0014), respectively. A. annua 1 \u03bcg/mL did not significantly inhibit TNF-\u03b1 production (8.8%; P>0.05).

When the incidence of lymph node metastasis was determined by histological type, it was statistically significantly higher in intestinal (66.7 per cent) than in mucinous (4.2 per cent) tumours (P < 0.001). The presence of lymph node metastases had no influence on prognosis (P = 0.155). The surgical procedure (appendicectomy alone versus right hemicolectomy) had an influence on patient survival by univariate analysis (P < 0.001), but not by multivariate analysis (P = 0.258).\nContext 5: Cumulative incidences for pouch neoplasia at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years were 0.9%, 1.3%, 1.9%, 4.2%, and 5.1%, respectively. Thirty-eight patients (1.19%) had pouch neoplasia, including 11 (0.36%) with adenocarcinoma of the pouch and/or the anal-transitional zone (ATZ), 1 (0.03%) with pouch lymphoma, 3 with squamous cell cancer of the ATZ, and 23 with dysplasia (0.72%). In the Cox model, the risk factor associated with pouch neoplasia was a preoperative diagnosis of UC-associated cancer or dysplasia, with adjusted hazard ratios of 2.5 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.1-5.7) and 2.1 (1.0-4.4), respectively. The risk of pouch neoplasia was also significantly higher in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of UC-associated cancer or dysplasia (P = 0.001).\nContext 6: The incidence of pouch neoplasia was 0.9 per cent in 102 patients undergoing elective right or extended right hemicolectomy for colonic adenocarcinoma. The risk of pouch neoplasia was significantly higher in patients with a preoperative diagnosis of UC-associated cancer or dysplasia (P = 0.001).\nContext", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Bone marrow p16(INK4a)-deficiency in C57Bl6 mice did not influence high fat diet-induced obesity nor plasma glucose and lipid levels. Glucose tolerance tests showed no alterations in high fat diet-induced glucose intolerance. While bone marrow p16(INK4a)-deficiency did not affect the gene expression profile of adipose tissue, hepatic expression of the alternative markers Chi3l3, Mgl2 and IL10 was increased and the induction of pro-inflammatory Nos2 was restrained on the high fat diet. Bone marrow p16(INK4a)-deficiency in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice did not affect western diet-induced atherosclerotic plaque size or morphology. In line, plasma lipid levels remained unaffected and p16(INK4a)-deficient macrophages displayed equal cholesterol uptake and efflux compared to wild type macrophages.\nContext 2: A genomic region near the CDKN2A locus, encoding p16(INK4a), has been associated to type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease, conditions in which inflammation plays an important role. Recently, we found that deficiency of p16(INK4a) results in decreased inflammatory signaling in murine macrophages and that p16(INK4a) influences the phenotype of human adipose tissue macrophages. Therefore, we investigated the influence of immune cell p16(INK4a) on glucose tolerance and atherosclerosis in mice.\nContext 3: Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing cancer and co-morbidities that are part of the metabolic syndrome. Adipose tissue is recognized as an endocrine organ, as it affects a number of physiological functions, and contains adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs). ASCs can differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, and as such are applicable to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Yet the question of whether ASC functionality is affected by the donor's body mass index (BMI) still exists.\nContext 4: In the present study, we examined the contribution of haematopoietic-cell-derived IL-10 to the development of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We hypothesised that haematopoietic-cell-restricted deletion of IL-10 would exacerbate obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Lethally irradiated wild-type recipient mice receiving bone marrow from either wild-type or Il10-knockout mice were placed on either a chow or a high-fat diet. We found that IL-10-deficient haematopoietic cells exacerbated obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. In addition, we found that IL-10-deficient haematopoietic cells increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the adipose tissue of obese mice. Furthermore, we found that IL-10-deficient haematopoietic cells increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the adipose tissue of obese mice. In addition, we found that IL-10-deficient haematopoietic cells increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the adipose tissue of obese mice. Furthermore, we found that IL-10-deficient haemat", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Our data demonstrate that the cytokine differentiation profile in circulating T cells from HD patients is dysregulated and characterized by an increase in Th1 cells, but a normal amount of Th2 cells. Moreover, the skewed helper cell responses correlate with a higher percentage of monocytes capable of secreting the Th1 promoting cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12).\nContext 2: Patients on chronic intermittent haemodialysis (HD) show an impaired cellular and humoral immune response that clinically appears with frequent infectious complications and low vaccination responses. This immune defect strongly correlates with reduced in vitro proliferative responses of T cells. The defect is localized in antigen presenting cells, which show a decreased co-stimulatory activity. Furthermore, the impaired immune response correlates with an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In response to primary activation, CD4 positive T helper (Th) cells mainly differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 cells. Th1 cells support cell mediated immunity whereas Th2 cells enhance humoral immune responses. Since both types of responses mutually inhibit each other, the impaired humoral immune response seen in HD patients could either be due to a reduced number of Th2 cells or to a predominant Th1 response.\nContext 3: T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3), which is preferentially expressed on Th1 cells rather than Th2 cells, is considered to be a negative regulator of Th1 cell function. This suggests that TIM-3 indirectly enhances Th2-type immune responses by suppressing Th1 cell function.\nContext 4: TNF-alpha inhibition therapy affects the systemic immune response in rheumatoid arthritis by influencing T cell subtypes (Th1, Th2, Treg), but its effect on the intracellular signal transduction in T cells remains largely unexplored. Here we studied the activation of Th1-associated signalling molecule STAT4 and Th2-associated STAT6 in CD4+ T cells.\nContext 5: The cytokine production of T(H)2 cells retrovirally transfected with a vector expressing human T-bet was determined by means of intracellular FACS staining and ELISA. The effects of T-bet transfection were analyzed at the mRNA level by means of real-time PCR and DNA microarrays and confirmed by using functional chemokine response assays.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true?\nA. The cytokine differentiation profile in circulating T cells from HD patients is dysregulated and characterized by an increase in Th1 cells, but a normal amount of Th2 cells.\nB. Patients on chronic intermittent haemodialysis (HD) show an impaired cellular and humoral immune response that clinically appears with frequent infectious complications and low vaccination responses.

Two reports on local aprotinin administration, that is, into the pericardial cavity, also indicated improvement in postoperative blood loss, but the underlying mechanism was not investigated. We previously reported the disappearance of glycoprotein Ib from the platelet surface and the appearance of platelet-derived microparticles in the pericardial cavity of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass as signs of platelet activation. Here, we investigated whether such local aprot", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess whether CCL2 or interactions between this chemokine and its receptor (CCR2) are associated with outcomes of chronic hepatitis C and with responses to antiviral therapy.\nContext 2: Two hundred and eighty-four patients with chronic hepatitis C and 193 non-infected matched controls were included in this study. Patients were categorized according to their Scheuer score of hepatic fibrosis as F0-F2 (n = 202) or F3-F4 (n = 82) and according to their response to anti-Hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy as sustained response (SR, n = 101) or non-sustained response (NSR, n = 98). Genotyping of the -2518 (A/G) CCL2 was performed using PCR-RFLP, genotyping of the 190 (A/G) CCR2 using a PCR-ARMS system, and genotyping of the rs3138042 (G/A) CCR2 using Taqman probes.\nContext 3: We retrospectively reviewed our data of patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 treated with pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin. Baseline features were compared between patients with normal and high GGT levels. Factors associated with high GGT level and those associated with a SVR were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis.\nContext 4: Low gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level was shown to be an independent predictor of a sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C. We aimed to determine factors associated with high GGT level, and to evaluate whether low GGT level is an independent predictor of a SVR in chronic hepatitis C genotype 1.\nContext 5: In the study group of 83 HCV patients, the main genotype was genotype 1 (70%, n = 58) and the overall SVR was 32.53% (n = 27). In the HCV-1 group, SVR was 27%, whereas SVR was 44% in the HCV-2 group. We found an association between rs12979860 CC and SVR in a codominant model (OR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.12-20.8, P = 0.033). There was no statistically significant association between SVR and rs8099917 or rs8103142. rs12979860 CC was associated with a higher risk of HCV-1 infection (OR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.12-20.8, P = 0.033).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the CCR2 gene polymorphism and the response to pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients. The CCR2 gene polymorphism was determined by PCR-ARMS in 100 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The patients were divided into two groups according to the response to therapy. The CCR2 gene polymorphism was not associated with the response to therapy.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The rate of decline in lung function is a strong predictor of future decline in lung function in cystic fibrosis patients.

Number of microemboli was monitored with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 58 patients during the operation and in a random subgroup of 27 patients directly following the procedure.\nA preoperative warning of progressive cerebral ischemia during surgery may be of use in planning carotid end", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study aimed to construct a kind of PEG-coated irinotecan cationic liposomes for investigating its efficacy and mechanism of action in the treatment of breast cancer in preclinical models.\nContext 2: The zeta potential of PEG-coated irinotecan cationic liposomes was approximately 23 mV. The PEG-coated irinotecan cationic liposomes were approximately 66nm in diameter, significantly increased the intracellular uptake of irinotecan, and showed strong inhibitory effect on MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. A significant antitumor efficacy in the xenografted MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells in nude mice was evidenced by intravenous administration of PEG-coated irinotecan cationic liposomes. PEG-coated irinotecan cationic liposomes also improved the irinotecan blood circulation time and showed an enhanced drug concentration in tumor.\nContext 3: Evaluations were performed on the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, the xenografted MDA-MB231 cancer cells in Female nude mice and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat. The liposomes were characterized through assays of cytotoxicity, intracellular uptake, nuclei morphology, antitumor activities, pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution.\nContext 4: Randomized studies have shown that irinotecan (CPT-11) extends survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients when administered in second-line and when added to fluorouracil (FU) plus leucovorin (LV) in first-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer. When this study was initiated, FU plus LV was standard adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of weekly bolus CPT-11 plus FU plus LV in the treatment of patients with completely resected stage III colon cancer.\nContext 5: We assessed the combination of doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin with trastuzumab for alterations in peak serum drug levels, as these agents are increasingly being paired in the treatment of aggressive breast cancer. We hypothesized that trastuzumab would exhibit a slower rate of elimination from the serum when in combination with liposomal doxorubicin based on the known effects of liposomal doxorubicin on phagocytic cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), which are responsible in part for the clearance of doxorubicin from the circulation.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly bolus CPT-11 plus FU plus LV in the treatment of patients with completely resected stage III colon cancer.\nContext 7: We assessed the combination of doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin with trastuzumab for alterations in peak serum drug levels, as these agents are increasingly being paired in the treatment of aggressive breast cancer. We hypothesized that trastuzumab would exhibit a slower rate of elimination from the serum when in combination with liposomal doxorubicin based on the known effects of liposomal doxorubicin on phagocytic cells", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Sequencing technologies are generating enormous amounts of read data, however assembly of genomes and metagenomes remain among the most challenging tasks. In this paper we study the comparison of genomes and metagenomes only based on read data, using word counts statistics called alignment-free thus not requiring reference genomes or assemblies. Quality scores produced by sequencing platforms are fundamental for various analyses, moreover future-generation sequencing platforms, will produce longer reads but with error rate around 15 %. In this context it will be fundamental to exploit quality values information within the framework of alignment-free measures.\nContext 2: In this paper we present a family of alignment-free measures, called d (q) -type, that are based on k-mer counts and quality values. These statistics can be used to compare genomes and metagenomes based on their read sets. Results show that the evolutionary relationship of genomes can be reconstructed based on the direct comparison of theirs reads sets.\nContext 3: We show how evolution, data-specific biases, and sequencing errors are naturally dealt with probabilistically. Our method achieves better results than Bowtie and BWA on simulated and real ancient and PAR-CLIP reads, as well as on simulated reads from the AT rich organism P. falciparum, when modeling the biases of these data. For simulated Illumina reads, the method has consistently higher sensitivity for both single-end and paired-end data. We also show that our probabilistic approach can limit the problem of random matches from short reads of contamination and that it improves the mapping of real reads from one organism (D. melanogaster) to a related genome (D. simulans).\nContext 4: Modern DNA sequencing methods produce vast amounts of data that often requires mapping to a reference genome. Most existing programs use the number of mismatches between the read and the genome as a measure of quality. This approach is without a statistical foundation and can for some data types result in many wrongly mapped reads. Here we present a probabilistic mapping method based on position-specific scoring matrices, which can take into account not only the quality scores of the reads but also user-specified models of evolution and data-specific biases.\nContext 5: Using the X chromosome genomic content difference between male D. melanogaster and female D. yakuba and D. simulans, we describe a decrease in the ability to accurately measure genomic content (copy number) for orthologs that are only 90% identical. We demonstrate that genome characteristics (e.g. chromatin environment and non-templated nucleotide addition) can be used to predict the accuracy of copy number measurements. We also show that the accuracy of copy number measurements can be improved by using a probabilistic model of the genome.\nContext 6: We present a probabilistic method for mapping short reads to a reference genome. The method is based on a probabilistic model of the genome and a probabilistic model of the read. The model of the genome is based on the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of the genome and the model of the read is based on the quality scores of the read. The method is able to map short reads to the genome with high accuracy and can be used to map reads from one organism to a related genome. The method is", "No, perioperative blood transfusions do not affect disease recurrence of patients undergoing curative resection of colorectal carcinoma.\nExplanation: The Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) study was a randomized, controlled trial of perioperative blood transfusions in patients undergoing curative resection for stage II or III colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint was disease recurrence. The study was stopped early because of the lack of a significant difference in recurrence rates between the two groups. The study was stopped because of the lack of a significant difference in recurrence rates between the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Bradykinin at 10 nM and 1 \u00b5M concentrations triggered a neuroprotective cascade via kinin-B2 receptor activation which conferred protection against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Recovery of population spikes induced by 10 nM bradykinin was completely abolished when the peptide was co-applied with the selective kinin-B2 receptor antagonist HOE-140. Kinin-B2 receptor activation promoted survival of hippocampal neurons via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, while MEK/MAPK signaling was not involved in protection against NMDA-evoked excitotoxic effects. However, 100 nM Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin, a potent kinin-B1 receptor agonist, reversed bradykinin-induced population spike recovery. The inhibition of population spikes recovery was reversed by PD98059, showing that MEK/MAPK was involved in the induction of apoptosis mediated by the B1 receptor.\nContext 2: Kinins, with bradykinin and des-Arg(9)-bradykinin being the most important ones, are pro-inflammatory peptides released after tissue injury including stroke. Although the actions of bradykinin are in general well characterized; it remains controversial whether the effects of bradykinin are beneficial or not. Kinin-B2 receptor activation participates in various physiological processes including hypotension, neurotransmission and neuronal differentiation. The bradykinin metabolite des-Arg(9)-bradykinin as well as Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin activates the kinin-B1 receptor known to be expressed under inflammatory conditions. We have investigated the effects of kinin-B1 and B2 receptor activation on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity measured as decreased capacity to produce synaptically evoked population spikes in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices.\nContext 3: To investigate a potential protective role of the kinin B2 receptor in a glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis mouse model.\nContext 4: Using primary cortical neurons, we examined the effect of BDNF on MA-induced neuronal death. In addition, using pharmacologic and molecular biological tools, we elucidated which pathways are involved in this effect.\nContext 5: Methamphetamine (MA) induces degeneration of various regions of the brain, resulting in neuropsychiatric damage. Although the underlying mechanisms of MA-induced neuronal death are not fully understood, the involvement of the kinin system has been suggested. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the kinin system in MA-induced neuronal death.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the kinin system in MA-induced neuronal death.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the kinin system in MA-induced neuronal death.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the kinin system in MA-induced neuronal death.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the kinin system in MA-induced neuronal death.\nContext 10: The aim of this study was", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess the pulmonary artery (PA) diastolic-occlusion (wedge) pressure gradient in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and to evaluate this variable's diagnostic utility.\nContext 2: Initial hemodynamics (systolic, diastolic, and mean systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, occlusion pressure, PA diastolic-occlusion pressure gradient, cardiac output, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances) were compared between cohorts. Other than differences in the PA diastolic-occlusion pressure gradients, no significant differences were identified between cohorts. Pulmonary embolism patients were found to have increased PA diastolic-occlusion pressure gradients (10 +/- 5 vs. 3 +/- 2 mm Hg for the critically ill controls [p <.0002], and 4 +/- 4 mm Hg for the coronary artery disease cohort [p <.0005]). However, no significant difference in PA diastolic-occlusion pressure gradient values was identified when patients with proven pulmonary embolism were compared with patients in whom pulmonary embolism was clinically suspected yet not confirmed by angiograms (10 +/- 9 mm Hg; NS). For three of 19 pulmonary embolism patients, no occlusion pressure could be obtained due to an inability to wedge the balloon tip; 13 of 16 patients had PA diastolic-occlusion pressure gradients of > or = 8 mm Hg. In the pulmonary embolism cohort, PA diastolic-occlusion pressure gradient correlated well with pulmonary vascular resistance (r2 =.50; p <.05), but not with cardiac output or heart rate.\nContext 3: Despite the recognition that acute lung injury (ALI) can elevate pulmonary artery (PA) pressure and right ventricular afterload, the impact of pulmonary vascular dysfunction on outcomes of these patients is not well defined.\nContext 4: Current concepts of acute pulmonary embolism suggest that right ventricular (RV) dilatation and failure are the consequence of pressure overload-induced RV hypoperfusion and ischemia.\nContext 5: Fat embolism was associated with a transient increase (21 +/- 7mmHg) in pulmonary arterial pressure. A transient decrease in arterial blood pressure and temporary increases in central venous pressure and dead space were also observed. No significant changes in any cardiovascular variable were observed after fat embolism in the sildenafil group. There was significantly (P < 0.05) less intravascular volume depletion in the sildenafil group than in the placebo group.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of sildenafil in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) would improve hemodynamics and decrease the need for vasopressor support.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of sildenafil in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) would improve hemodynamics and decrease the need for vasopressor support.\nContext 8: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of sildenafil in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) would improve hemodynamics and decrease the need for vasopressor support.\nContext 9: The purpose of this", "Question: Does prehospital airway technique influence incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients??\nExplanation: The prehospital airway device used is associated with an increased risk of VAP in risk-adjusted critically injured patients. The use of an extraglottic airway device is associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of VAP compared to endotracheal intubation. The use of a bag-valve mask ventilation (BVM) is associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of VAP compared to endotracheal intubation.

The recombinant plasmid pEGFP-C1+EGScat1+cat2 was constructed and the blank vector without EGS fragment was used as control plasmids. By using the CaCl(2) transformation method, the recombinant plasmids were introduced into the clinically isolated Cm resistant but Km sensitive E coli strains. Transformants were screened on LB agar plates containing Km. Extraction of plasmids and PCR were applied to identify the positive clones. The growth curve of EGS transformed bacteria cultured in broth with Cm resistance was determined by using spectrophotometer at A(600). Drug sensitivity was tested in solid culture containing Cm by using KB method.\nContext 3: In general, up to 72.1% of all E. coli clones were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline with a variety of different resistance genes involved. There was no significant correlation between one of the nominal or numerical colonization parameters and the absence or presence of antimicrobial resistance properties or resistance genes. However, there were several statistically significant associations between the occurrence of single resistance genes and single virulence associated genes.\nContext 4: Transformation studies were carried out on 16 clinically isolated Cm-resistant (250 microg/mL of Cm) E coli strains by using pEGFP-C1-EGScat1cat2 recombinant plasmid. Transformants were screened on LB-agar plates containing Km after the transformation using EGS. Of the 16 tested strains, 4 strains were transformed successfully. Transformants with EGS plasmid showed growth inhibition when grown in liquid broth culture containing 200 microg/mL of Cm. In drug sensitivity test, these strains were sensitive to Cm on LB-agar plates containing 200 microg/mL of Cm. Extraction of plasmids and PCR amplification showed the existence of EGS plasmids in these four transformed strains. These results indicated that EGS plasmid could be used to transform Cm-resistant E coli strains.\nContext 5: The results of this study showed that the EGS plasmid could be used to transform Cm-resistant E coli strains.

However, the sequence of these events and their impact on early graft function remain controversial. We therefore investigated whether KC induce microcirculatory disturbances through ROS release and whether microcirculatory failure contributes to early graft function after liver transplantation.\nContext 2: There is suggestive evidence that reactive oxygen species may play a role in the initiation of liver regeneration via a kupffer cell-mediated mechanism involving TNFa and NF-kappa B. In mammalian cells, a major source of reactive oxygen species derives from the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase system (no protein de novo synthesis is required) and it is known that the low levels of oxidants produced through NADPH oxidase play a role in liver cell proliferation because of peroxisome proliferators.\nContext 3: Transplantation of hAMSCs significantly reduced the fibrotic area, deposition of type-I collagen, the number of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive hepatic stellate cells, and CD68-positive Kupffer cells in the livers. messenger RNA expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was significantly decreased and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and hepatocyte growth factor was significantly increased in the liver of hAMSC-treated rats. Transplantation of hAMSCs at 3 weeks plus 5 weeks did not have an additive effect. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Kupffer cell activation induced by lipopolysaccharide was significantly decreased by culturing with conditioned medium obtained from hAMSCs.\nContext 4: Treatment with acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors leads to increased liver acetaldehyde levels and prevents hepatic inflammation and necrosis in ethanol-fed rats. This is accompanied by IkappaBa preservation and decreased activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. The present in vitro study was aimed to clarify whether acetaldehyde has an effect on degradation of IkappaBalpha and activation of NF-kappaB in LPS-stimulated rat Kupffer cells.\nContext 5: Liver fibrosis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL/kg of 50% carbon tetrachloride twice a week for 6 weeks. At 3 weeks, hAMSCs (1 \u00d7 10(6) cells) were injected into the portal vein of the rats. The rats were sacrificed at 3 weeks and 6 weeks after transplantation. The expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 was significantly decreased and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and hepatocyte growth factor was significantly increased in the liver of hAMSC-treated rats. Transplantation of hAMSCs at 3 weeks plus 5 weeks did not have an additive effect.

Despite lower HbA1c, women on insulin pumps did not have an increased incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (8.0% vs 7.6%, p = 0.90) or more weight gain (16.3 \u00b1 8.7 vs 15.2 \u00b1 6.2 kg, p = 0.18). More large-for-gestational-age infants in the pump group (55.0% vs 39.2%, p = 0.007) may have resulted from confounding by parity.\nContext 2: The aim of this study was to compare glycaemic control and maternal-fetal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes managed on insulin pumps compared with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI).\nContext 3: Observational study of 107 consecutive pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (median duration 16 years (range 1-36), HbA1c 6.6% (4.9-10.5) in early pregnancy) and 22 healthy pregnant women. At 8, 14, 21, 27 and 33 weeks (women with diabetes) and 15, 28 and 34 weeks (healthy women) blood was sampled for measurements of glucose, adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol, insulin, C-peptide, HbA1c, and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Maternal-fetal outcomes were assessed at 34 weeks.\nContext 4: Women with type 1 diabetes (n = 107) were managed with insulin pumps (n = 57) or multiple daily injections (n = 50). Women on insulin pumps had lower HbA1c (6.6% (4.9-10.5) vs 7.0% (5.5-9.5), p < 0.001) and lower mean blood glucose (mean 5.8 \u00b1 1.1 vs 6.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The large monophyletic genus Mimosa comprises approx. 500 species, most of which are native to the New World, with Central Brazil being the main centre of radiation. All Brazilian Mimosa spp. so far examined are nodulated by rhizobia in the betaproteobacterial genus Burkholderia. Approximately 10 Mya, transoceanic dispersal resulted in the Indian subcontinent hosting up to six endemic Mimosa spp. The nodulation ability and rhizobial symbionts of two of these, M. hamata and M. himalayana, both from north-west India, are here examined, and compared with those of M. pudica, an invasive species.\nContext 2: Both native Indian Mimosa spp. nodulated effectively in their respective rhizosphere soils. Based on 16S rRNA, nifH and nodA sequences, their symbionts were identified as belonging to the alphaproteobacterial genus Ensifer, and were closest to the 'Old World' Ensifer saheli, E. kostiensis and E. arboris. In contrast, the invasive M. pudica was predominantly nodulated by Betaproteobacteria in the genera Cupriavidus and Burkholderia. All rhizobial strains tested effectively nodulated their original hosts, but the symbionts of the native species could not nodulate M. pudica.\nContext 3: Nodules were collected from several locations, and examined by light and electron microscopy. Rhizobia isolated from them were characterized in terms of their abilities to nodulate the three Mimosa hosts. The molecular phylogenetic relationships of the rhizobia were determined by analysis of 16S rRNA, nifH and nodA gene sequences.\nContext 4: Phylogenetic tree analysis identified seven distinct genotypes. The seven genotypes were evident by both distance matrix methods and maximum parsimony analysis, and were strongly supported by bootstrap resampling of the data. The intra-genotypic gag distances averaged 7%, whereas the inter-genotypic distances averaged 14%. The geographic distribution of variants was complex. Some genotypes have apparently migrated to several continents and many areas harbor a mixture of genotypes. Related variants may cluster in certain areas, particularly isolates from a single city collected over a short time.\nContext 5: Effective policies, management, and scientific research programs depend on the correct identification of invasive species as being either native or non-native. The identification of Mimosa pudica as a non-native species is discussed. The taxonomic status of M. pudica is discussed in the context of the genus Mimosa, and the taxonomic status of the Mimosa genus is discussed in the context of the genus Mimosa.

Two scan protocols were used: cross line scan for measuring choroidal thickness and the retina map scan to measure retinal thickness. Each patient was scanned before and within 3 minutes after the stress test. Blood pressure was measured at the same time as the acquisition of the scans. Choroidal thickness was measured from the posterior edge of the retinal pigment epithelium to the choroid-sclera junction at 500-\u03bcm intervals up to 1,000 \u03bcm temporal and nasal to the fovea. Retinal thickness was measured by an automated software. All choroidal thickness measurements were performed by two independent observers.\nContext 3: Fifteen patients (15 eyes) with a mean age of 60.6 (\u00b110.4 years) were scanned. There was a significant increase in systolic but not diastolic pressure after stress testing (P < 0.05). The mean choroidal thickness measurements showed no significant difference before and after exercise stress testing (P > 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in retinal thickness before and after stress testing measurements (P > 0.05).\nContext 4: The systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly lower at the post-exercise period compared to pre-exercise rest (P < 0.05), with the largest reductions being observed at the 60th minutes of recovery [SBP (rest: 125.9 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 60th minutes of recovery: 111.7 \u00b1 5.4 mmHg); DBP (rest: 78.8 \u00b1.7 vs. 60th minutes of recovery: 69.8 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg)] and at the same periods of post-exercise recovery of the control session.\nContext 5: Exaggerated exercise blood pressure (BP) predicts mortality.

However, both low and high STV has been shown in fallers and in nonfallers; therefore, the interpretation of STV of spatiotemporal gait parameters remains difficult. Thus, we sought to characterize and compare STV of spatial and temporal stride parameters among young and older healthy adults, and to determine the extent to which opposite results in STV could provide similar implications in terms of gait stability.\nContext 2: Dual tasking significantly (p < 0.05) decreased walking speed, while stride time variability increased, and stability and regularity of lateral trunk accelerations decreased. Cognitively impaired elderly showed significantly (p < 0.05) more changes in gait variability than cognitive intact elderly. Differences in dynamic parameters between groups were more discerned under dual task conditions.\nContext 3: Falls in frail elderly are a common problem with a rising incidence. Gait and postural instability are major risk factors for falling, particularly in geriatric patients. As walking requires attention, cognitive impairments are likely to contribute to an increased fall risk. An objective quantification of gait and balance ability is required to identify persons with a high tendency to fall. Recent studies have shown that stride variability is increased in elderly and under dual task condition and might be more sensitive to detect fall risk than walking speed. In the present study we complemented stride related measures with measures that quantify trunk movement patterns as indicators of dynamic balance ability during walking. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect of impaired cognition and dual tasking on gait variability and stability in geriatric patients.\nContext 4: Mean values of coefficients of variation of spatiotemporal gait parameters were collected from 30 young adults (14 men and 16 women; mean age 28.1 +/- 6.0 years) and 33 older adults (2 men and 31 women; mean age 74.4 +/- 7.1 years) walking at self-chosen normal walking speed over a GAITRite System.\nContext 5: An age-related increase in STV was only observed with stride width (p = 0.012), whereas increased stride length and stance time variability in older adults were related to decreased walking speed (p = 0.006 and p = 0.018). In addition, both low and high STV was found in fallers and nonfallers, suggesting that the interpretation of STV of spatiotemporal gait parameters remains difficult.\nContext 6: Dual tasking significantly (p < 0.05) decreased walking speed, while stride time variability increased, and stability and regularity of lateral trunk accelerations decreased.

MiR-335 has recently been identified to be involved in tumorigenesis of several cancers such as ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. However, the regulation of miR-335 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been reported yet.\nContext 2: Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. The cancer-related inflammation pathway- signal transducer and activator of transition 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway has been reported to play critical role in its initiation and progression, while the way mediated its hyperactivation remains elusive so far. Accumulating studies reported the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of gene expression, among of which, the miR-124/STAT3 interaction has been widely reported in various cancers, while its role in EC has not been investigated yet.\nContext 3: The expression level of miR-335 was reduced in malignant tissue samples in comparison to normal matched tissue (P < 0.05). It was also proved that miR-335 expression was associated with ESCC histological grade, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage and clinical stage (P < 0.05). In addition, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that low miR-335 expression was associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that miR-335 expression was an independent prognostic marker of overall survival of ESCC patients.\nContext 4: To understand the involvement of micro-RNA (miRNA) in the development and progression of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), miRNA profiles were compared between tumour and corresponding non-tumour tissues.\nContext 5: The deregulation of miR-146b-5p, miR-375, miR-148a, miR-31, and miR-451 was associated significantly with gastric adenocarcinomas. Conversely, deregulation of miR-21 (up-regulation) and miR-133b (down-regulation) was detectable in both gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas. It was noteworthy that miR-200a was significantly down-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma samples (P =.04) but was up-regulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (P =.04). In addition, miR-200b was significantly down-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma samples (P =.04) but was up-regulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (P =.04). In contrast, miR-200c was significantly up-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma samples (P =.04) but was down-regulated in esophageal adenocarcinoma samples (P =.04).

We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of all of the enrolled patients. To determine the effect of postoperative LoS on long-term survival, we separated the patients into three groups based on the lengths of their postoperative LoS, including an LoS of less than 2 weeks (Group 1, \u22642 W), an LoS between 2 and 3 weeks (Group", "#1\nExplanation: We examined the role of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in the formation of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 following interleukin-1beta (IL-1) stimulation in bovine endothelial cells transfected with lipocaline-type PGD2 synthase (L-PGDS) genes.

Baroreceptor unloading and the consequent sympathoexcitation, as during head up tilt, decreases pain threshold and arouses the central nervous system (CNS), whereas hypotension exerts a direct CNS depressant effect. We estimated the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane for immobility in patients undergoing surgery in the sitting position, in comparison to MAC desflurane for patients having a similar type of surgery in the supine position.\nContext 2: To determine whether the \"second gas effect\" is valid, we determined the pharmacokinetics of 0.2% enflurane with or without 80% N2) (n = 7 each) under controlled constant volume ventilation in 14 young healthy male patients before their operations. The alveolar (end-tidal) concentration (FA) and inspired concentration (FI) at the mouthpiece and the arterial blood concentration of enflurane were measured, and the ratio of FA to FI was calculated. The FA/FI of enflurane increased rapidly during the first few minutes of administration and then increased slowly. No significant difference was found in the FA/FI between the two groups at any time point (P > 0.05). The arterial blood concentrations of enflurane increased progressively and were not significantly different between the two groups at any time point (P > 0.05). The results indicate that, at high concentrations, N2O neither facilitated the increase of FA nor enhanced the uptake of a companion gas. The second gas effect is a nonexistent phenomenon in clinical practice because the concentrating effect is very weak and the augmentation effect is nonexistent under controlled ventilation.\nContext 3: In vitro, halogenated agents reduce the pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to alveolar hypoxia in isolated perfused lungs. However, studies in intact animals have been less convincing. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of sub-MAC concentrations of desflurane on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in anesthetized piglets using the pressure/cardiac output relationship (P/Q).\nContext 4: In hypoxia, pressure gradients (PAP-LAP) increased significantly at every level of Q, but the increase was greater at higher Q. The PAP-LAP was significantly greater at higher Q than at lower Q. The PAP-LAP was significantly greater at higher Q than at lower Q.

A family history of early pathological thrombosis was defined as stroke, heart attack, or deep venous thrombosis before 50 years of age or multiple miscarriages in the parents or grandparents of the patient. We evaluated the association between family history and the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation (FVL) and/or Prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTG) in these children.\nContext 4: This nationwide study aimed to determine whether venous thromboembolism (VTE) shares familial susceptibility with coronary heart disease (CHD).\nContext 5: The Swedish Multigeneration Register of 0- to 75-year-old subjects was linked to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and the Cause of Death Register for the period 1987 to 2007. Odds ratios (ORs) for VTE and ischemic stroke were determined in 2 ways: odds of ischemic stroke in offspring whose parents had been diagnosed with VTE, and odds of VTE in offspring whose parents had been diagnosed with ischemic stroke. The analyses were repeated for siblings and spouses. Offspring of parents with VTE (n=25,929) were at increased risk for ischemic stroke (n=5595): OR, 1.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.14).

The TAU gene was screened by sequencing and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography.\nContext 3: Among 557 dementia cases, 24 (4.3%) had undergone a CABG prior to the onset of dementia with a median lag time of 5.5 years (range = 0.1 to 15.9). Among 557 controls, 28 subjects (5.0%) had undergone a CABG prior to the index year with a median lag time 3.9 years (range = 0.1 to 12.3); OR = 0.85 (95% CI = 0.49 to 1.49; p = 0.57) for dementia and OR = 0.78 (95% CI = 0.39 to 1.56; p = 0.48) for AD. The findings did not change after adjustment for education. The perioperative courses of cases and controls were comparable. Analyses including only the 481 cases of dementia with presumed neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular etiology were also negative.\nContext 4: A total of 856 deceased participants from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies, Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed a mean of 7.5 annual evaluations, including 17 cognitive tests. Neuropathologic examinations provided quantitative measures of global Alzheimer pathology, amyloid load, tangle density, macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models were used to examine the linear relation of pathologic indices with global cognitive decline. In subsequent analyses, random change point models were used to examine the relation of the pathologic indices with the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline (ie, nonlinear decline).\nContext 5: Behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is clinically characterised by progressive behavioural changes and social interpersonal dysfunctions.

Several distinct mutations, either in JAK2 (exon 12) or in c-Mpl (W515L) have been described in subsets of other MPDs, polycythemia vera, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. Analogous to JAK2,V617F these mutations cause constitutive JAK2 and signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) activation. It has therefore been proposed that constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway underlies the molecular etiology of all MPDs. We investigated the alternative hypothesis that distinct alterations, separate from the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway, underlie a subset of JAK2V617F-negative ET.\nContext 4: A PV expression signature was enriched for genes involved in hematopoietic development, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation. By quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, 23 genes were consistently deregulated in all patient samples. Several of these genes such as WT1 and KLF4 were regulated by JAK2, whereas others such as NFIB and EVI1 seemed to be deregulated in PV by a JAK2-independent mechanism. Using cell line models and comparing gene expression profiles of cell lines and PV CD34(+) PV specimens, we have identified panels of 14 JAK2-dependent genes and 12 JAK2-independent genes. These two 14- and 12-gene sets could separate not only PV from normal CD34(+) specimens, but also other MPN such as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis from their normal counterparts.\nContext 5: Messenger RNA isolated from CD34(+) cells from nine PV patients and normal controls was profiled using Affymetrix arrays. Gene expression change mediated by JAK2V617F was determined by profiling CD34(+) cells from 10 PV patients and 10 normal controls. The JAK2V617F signature was enriched for genes involved in hematopoietic development, inflammatory responses, and cell proliferation.

AMPA antagonists have shown promise in several adult hypoxic-ischemic brain injury models, and we wanted to see if this work could be extended to a newborn animal.\nContext 2: We demonstrated earlier in our laboratories that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FDP) would improve the outcome of hypoxic ischemic injury to the brain in the adult rabbit. Since many human newborns suffer hypoxic injury to the brain, with a secondary ischemic component due to hypoxic cardiac failure, we set out to reproduce similar experiments in newborn piglets. Hypoxic ischemic CNS damage was induced by ligating both carotid arteries and reducing BP to 66% of normal for 30 min; in the last 15 min, FIO2 was reduced to 0.6. Twelve piglets were randomized to receive either 175 mg/kg of FDP in the last 5 min before reoxygenation or the equivalent volume of saline. The other 20 piglets received 75 mg/kg of FDP in the 5 min immediately before carotid ligation, followed by 1.8 mg/kg.min continuous infusion for the 30 min of hypoxia and ischemia or an equivalent volume of saline.\nContext 3: The excitatory amino acid inhibitor MK-801 has been shown in many animals species to protect against hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. We sought to determine whether hypoxic-ischemic injury to the newborn pig's brain could be prevented by the use of MK-801.\nContext 4: Hypoxic-ischemic injury to the brain was induced in forty 0-3-day-old piglets. They were randomized to receive either 3 mg/kg MK-801 (MK-801 group, n = 20) or vehicle (control group, n = 19) prior to insult. At time 0, the carotid arteries were ligated and the blood pressure was reduced by one third by hemorrhage. At 15 minutes, inspired oxygen was reduced from 50% to 6%. At 30 minutes, inspired oxygen was changed to 100%, carotid ligatures were released, and the withdrawn blood was reinfused. An additional 14 piglets received 3 mg/kg MK-801 but were not subjected to the insult. At 30 minutes, the piglets were sacrificed and the brains were removed and weighed. The brains were then fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin.

Men hospitalized for vasectomy in Denmark from 1977 to 1989 were followed for death, emigration and incident cancer by administrative registers. The observed number of patients with cancer in the cohort was divided by the number expected based on the cancer incidence rate for all Danish men, providing a standardized incidence ratio. A total of 46 cohort patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer, while 46.93 were expected (standardized incidence ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.3).

In young rats only, this improved acquisition learning was maintained at 4 (P = 0.003) but not at 12 weeks postexposure (P = 0.061). There were no differences in swim speed or in open field exploration between groups (no confounding effects of stress or locomotion). Retention memory measured using probe trials was not affected by exposure to sevoflurane in young adult or aged rats.\nContext 2: The effects of anesthesia with 1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for 4 h or sham exposure on cognition were investigated in young adult and aged (20-24 months) rats at 1, 4, and 12 weeks postexposure. Spatial reference memory acquisition and retention were tested in the Morris water maze task. Latency to locate the hidden platform and swim speed were determined and compared between treatments.\nContext 3: Roughly, 10% of elderly patients develop postoperative cognitive dysfunction. General anesthesia impairs spatial memory in aged rats, but the mechanism is not known. Hippocampal neurogenesis affects spatial learning and memory in rats, and isoflurane affects neurogenesis in neonatal and young adult rats. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane impairs neurogenesis and hippocampal function in aged rats.\nContext 4: Isoflurane was administered to 16-month-old rats at one minimum alveolar concentration for 4 h. FluoroJade staining was performed to assess brain cell death 16 h after isoflurane administration. Dentate gyrus progenitor proliferation was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine injection 4 days after anesthesia and quantification of bromodeoxyuridine+ cells 12 h later. Neuronal differentiation was studied by determining colocalization of bromodeoxyuridine with the immature neuronal marker NeuroD 5 days after anesthesia. New neuronal survival was assessed by quantifying cells coexpressing bromodeoxyuridine and the mature neuronal marker NeuN 5 weeks after anesthesia. Four months after anesthesia, associative learning was assessed by fear conditioning. Spatial reference memory acquisition and retention was tested in the Morris water maze task. Latency to locate the hidden platform and swim speed were determined and compared between treatments.\nContext 5: The effects of anesthesia with 1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for 4 h or sham exposure on cognition were investigated in young adult and aged (20-24 months) rats at 1, 4, and 12 weeks postexposure.

FOXP3-positive tumors were associated with significantly higher nuclear grade, higher histologic grade and a more negative estrogen receptor status. The FOXP3 expression level was independently associated with high Ki-67 index in a logistic regression model. In the node-positive subgroup, strong FOXP3 positivity was related to poor disease-free survival and disease-specific survival compared to FOXP3-negative patients, whereas there was no survival difference between FOXP3-negative and FOXP3-weak-positive patients. Multivariate analysis with adjustment for patient age and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status demonstrated significantly poor survival of FOXP3-strong-positive patients in node-positive patients.\nContext 2: We evaluated the FOXP3 expression status of 183 patients who underwent curative surgery for breast cancer using the immunohistochemical assay of tissue microarray.\nContext 3: Recent preclinical studies have shown that Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) is an important tumor suppressor gene. The clinical and prognostic implication of FOXP3 expression in breast cancer cells still remains controversial.\nContext 4: Breast cancers are heterogeneous, making it essential to recognise several biomarkers for cancer outcome predictions. Ki67 proliferation index and B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) proteins are widely used as prognostic indicators in many types of malignancies. While Ki67 is a marker of normal or tumour cell proliferation, BCL2 plays a central role in antiproliferative activities. A combination of these two biomarkers with contrary purposes can provide enhanced prognostic accuracy than an analysis using a single biomarker.\nContext 5: Caspase-3 expression was studied by means of reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a series of 108 previously untreated patients with breast cancer. Expression levels were correlated with those obtained using the same technique of the apoptosis-associated X-chromosome genes RBMX, RBM3, RBM10 small and RBM10 large variant; Bcl-2 and Bax; the angiogenesis-associated genes VEGF and CD105 (endoglin); hMAM and Nup88. The correlation with the expression of hormone receptors, c-erb-B2, mutant p53 and Ki-67, all measured by means of immunohistochemistry, was also studied.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the expression of the apoptosis-associated X-chromosome genes RBMX, RBM3, RBM10 small and RBM10 large variant; Bcl-2 and Bax; the angiogenesis-associated genes VEGF and CD105 (endoglin); hMAM and Nup88 in breast cancer patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the expression of the apoptosis-associated X-chromosome genes RBMX, RBM3, RBM10 small and RBM10 large variant; Bcl-2 and Bax; the angiogenesis-associated", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To examine the intra- and interexaminer reliability of assessing rotation of teeth on photographed study casts. In addition, the reliability parameters of two examiners scoring in mutual consultation were compared with the reliability parameters by one observer.\nContext 2: Standardized photographs of sets of maxillary and mandibular plaster casts of 10 patients before treatment (T1), after treatment (T2), and a long time after retention (T3) were digitized. Tooth rotation was assessed relative to a correct position in the ideal dental arch form. A computer analysis program was used to process the measurements. Two examiners assessed each study cast twice with a washout period of 3 weeks. A third examiner assessed each cast, together with one of the other examiners. The intra- and interexaminer agreements were calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine significant differences between the intra- and interexaminer reliability coefficients of the three examiners.\nContext 3: Forty third-year dental students, observing surgical procedures during their rotation in the Department of Periodontics, were invited to participate in a survey designed to examine perceptions relating to their learning experience to using conventional and video-assisted real-time visualisation of clinical procedures. Students' responses were obtained using a questionnaire administered immediately after the completion of the observational period. The survey employed attitude questions addressing both enabling and outcome criteria. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the student's responses. An open-ended question was also included in the survey to give students the opportunity to provide additional feedback regarding their experience and suggestions to improve on it.\nContext 4: The ICCs ranged from 0.430 to 0.991. Incisors showed the highest ICCs and molars showed the lowest ICCs. Intraexaminer ICCs of the experienced examiners were significantly higher than those of the examiner with less experience. No significant differences in the reliability between a single examiner and the combination of two examiners were found.\nContext 5: A total of 181 occlusal sites in primary teeth were assessed by one examiner using DIAGNOdent. The same examiner and a second examiner evaluated 72 of the sites again to assess intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility. After histological validation, lesions were divided at three thresholds according to the lesion depth: outer half of the enamel (D1), inner half of the enamel (D2) and dentine (D3). The intra- and inter-examiner reliability coefficients were calculated for each threshold. The intra- and inter-examiner reliability coefficients were significantly higher for D1 than for D2 and D3. The intra- and inter-examiner reliability coefficients were significantly higher for D1 than for D2 and D3. The intra- and inter-examiner reliability coefficients were significantly higher for D1 than for D2 and D3.

Our aim was to ascertain whether the severity of pre-existing leukoaraiosis is associated with outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke who are treated with endovascular stroke therapy.\nContext 3: We retrospectively analyzed data from 129 consecutive, prospectively enrolled patients with stroke undergoing endovascular stroke therapy at a single tertiary care center between January 2006 and August 2013. Leukoaraiosis was assessed as supratentorial white matter hypoattenuation on admission head CT and graded as 0-2 (absent-to-moderate) versus 3-4 (severe) according to the van Swieten scale. We dichotomized the 90-day mRS into good (0-2 or return to baseline) versus poor (3-6) as the primary study outcome. Incremental multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of a poor 90-day outcome.\nContext 4: Autopsy brains from 12 subjects with LA (mean age, 72 years; six men, six women) and nine subjects without LA (mean age, 73 years; six men, three women) were studied. Afferent microvascular density +/- standard deviation in LA lesions in deep WM (2.56% +/- 1.56) was significantly lower than that in corresponding deep WM of healthy subjects (3.20% +/- 1.82) (P =.018). Subjects with LA demonstrated decreased afferent vascular density at early ages in all three areas of the brain when compared with healthy subjects of the same age.\nContext 5: Brain MR angiography was performed on 463 patients with symptomatic ischaemic stroke to detect significant atherosclerosis (more than 50% stenosis of vessel diameter) in the IC- and EC arteries. Relationships between IC- or EC atherosclerosis and plasma tHcyt level and/or MTHFR 677C>T genotypes were analyzed after adjusting for vascular risk factors.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\n1.

Maize is one of the most important crops cultivated worldwide and its productivity is closely linked to the amount of fertilizer used. A survey of the transcriptomes of shoot and root tissues of a maize hybrid line and its two parental inbred lines grown under sufficient and limiting N conditions by mRNA-Seq has been conducted to have a better understanding of how different maize genotypes respond to N limitation.\nContext 2: A different set of genes were found to be N-responsive in the three genotypes. Many biological processes important for N metabolism such as the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process and the cellular amino acid metabolic process were enriched in the N-responsive gene list from the hybrid shoots but not from the parental lines' shoots. Coupled to this, sugar, carbohydrate, monosaccharide, glucose, and sorbitol transport pathways were all up-regulated in the hybrid, but not in the parents under N limitation. Expression patterns also differed between shoots and roots, such as the up-regulation of the cytokinin degradation pathway in the shoots of the hybrid and down-regulation of that pathway in the roots. The change of gene expression under N limitation in the hybrid resembled the parent with the higher NUE trait. The transcript abundances of alleles derived from each parent were estimated using polymorphic sites in mapped reads in the hybrid. While there were allele abundance differences, there was no correlation between these and the expression differences seen between the hybrid and the two parents.\nContext 3: Various methods have been developed to explore inter-genomic relationships among plant species. Here, we present a sequence similarity analysis based upon comparison of transcript-assembly and methylation-filtered databases from five plant species and physically anchored rice coding sequences.\nContext 4: A comparison of the frequency of sequence alignments, determined by MegaBLAST, between rice coding sequences in TIGR pseudomolecules and annotations vs 4.0 and comprehensive transcript-assembly and methylation-filtered databases from Lolium perenne (ryegrass), Zea mays (maize), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Glycine max (soybean) and Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) was undertaken. Each rice pseudomolecule was divided into 10 segments, each containing 10% of the functionally annotated, expressed genes. This indicated a correlation between relative segment position in the pseudomolecule and the frequency of sequence alignments. The frequency of sequence alignments was also correlated with the number of coding sequences in each pseudomolecule. The frequency of sequence alignments was also correlated with the number of coding sequences in each pseudomolecule. The frequency of sequence alignments was also correlated with the number of coding sequences in each pseudomolecule.

It is a sensitive marker of brain injury and has been used as a prognostic marker in adults with TBI. In this study, the authors evaluated the ability of S100B to predict severity of TBI and abnormal cranial CT results for children with TBI. The authors found that S100B levels were higher in children with moderate/severe TBI as compared to children with mild TBI based GCS score (0.281\u2009\u00b5g\u2009L(-1), 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.101, 0.461", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Calreticulin is a Ca(2+)-binding chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum which regulates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The effects of the calreticulin-STAT3 signaling pathway on cardiac mitochondria and on the progress of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are still unclear.\nContext 2: The DCM model was generated in rats by the daily oral administration of furazolidone. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic studies demonstrated enlarged LV dimensions and reduced systolic and diastolic functions at thirty weeks after the first furazolidone administration. Morphometric analysis showed significant myocardial degeneration, interstitial fibrosis, and mitochondrial swelling with fractured or dissolved cristae in the model group. Compared with the control group, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level of the freshly isolated cardiac mitochondria and the enzyme activities of cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase in the model group were significantly decreased (P<0.05). Real-time PCR and western-blot revealed the increased expression of calreticulin associated with decreased activity of STAT3 in the model group. When cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to furazolidone, a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and MMP, and the increase of apoptosis rate were observed. The mRNA and protein expression of CRT gradually increased with the increase of furazolidone concentration, associated with a gradual decrease of the STAT3 phosphorylation level both in the whole cell and mitochondrial fraction. When calreticulin was knocked down with siRNA in cardiomyocytes, these changes of cardiomyocytes and mitochondria induced by furazolidone were significantly attenuated.\nContext 3: Recent studies suggest that mutations in cardiac mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that regulate those mutations, however, remain undefined. Thus, we studied cardiac mtDNA repair mechanisms, mtDNA damage, and mitochondrial structure and function in mice with heart failure secondary to overexpression of TNF-alpha (TNF1.6 mice).\nContext 4: We have previously shown increased cardiac stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. STC1 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane and transgenic over-expression of STC1 is associated with increased energy utilization.\nContext 5: Gender and diet have an important role in the development of heart failure. We have previously shown that the expression of the cardiac transcription factor, cardiac myocyte nuclear factor 1 (cMycNFI), is increased in the heart of female rats with diet-induced heart failure. We hypothesized that the increased cMycNFI expression in the heart of female rats with diet-induced heart failure is associated with increased cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), on the expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the heart of rats with diet-induced heart failure.\nContext 7", "Question: Is six Weeks of Fluoroquinolone Antibiotic Therapy for Patients With Elevated Serum Prostate-specific Antigen Clinically Beneficial : A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial?\nExplanation: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 500 mg levofloxacin daily for 28 days vs 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily in 28 days in men with chronic bacterial prostatitis.

In contrast, antibody responses to the 19.5-kDa, 35-kDa, 45-kDa, 60-kDa, 89 kDa (VacA), and 180-kDa antigens occurred in 55.5%, 24%, 16.7%, 63%, 37%, and 7.4% of children, respectively. A higher prevalence of antibody response to CagA was found in the symptomatic Australian children with peptic ulcer disease (100%) compared with prevalence in those with nonulcer dyspepsia (56.3%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. No significant difference was found between the prevalence of antibody to CagA in the Australian peptic ulcer disease group (100%) and that in the asymptomatic Chinese children (81.8%).\nContext 2: CagA antibodies were present in 154 (52.5%) of the patients. There was no significant difference in colonisation density and cagA status: grade I, 23 (14%); grade II, 78 (50.6%); grade III, 42 (27.5%); and grade IV, 11 (7.2%) in the cagA(+) strains and 29 (21.2%), 57 (40.8%), 38 (27%), and 15 (11%), respectively, in the cagA(-) strains. There was no difference in topographic localisation between cagA(+) and cagA(-)H pylori. Mean anti-CagA titres were 0.84, 0.84, 0.89, and 0.73 in patients with grades I-IV bacterial density, respectively.\nContext 3: Nine antigens were commonly recognized by sera from Australian and Chinese subjects. These antigens were of molecular mass 19.5 kDa, 26.5 kDa, 35 kDa, 45 kDa, 60 kDa, 89 kDa (VacA), 116 kDa (CagA), and 180 kDA. A significant association between the prevalence of antibody to CagA and the prevalence of CagA was found in the Australian children with peptic ulcer disease (100% vs 56.3% for nonulcer dyspepsia, p = 0.0001). The prevalence of antibody to CagA was significantly higher in the symptomatic Australian children with peptic ulcer disease (100%) compared with the asymptomatic Chinese children (81.8%).\nContext 4: The prevalence of CagA antibodies was significantly higher in the symptomatic Australian children with peptic ulcer disease (100%) compared with the asymptomatic Chinese children (81.8%).\nContext 5: The prevalence of CagA antibodies was significantly higher in the symptomatic Australian children with peptic ulcer", "No, macrolides do not affect the incidence of moderate and severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia in symptomatic ureaplasma-positive infants.\nThe study was conducted in a tertiary, neonatal unit between January 2007 and December 2012. Infants \u226429 completed weeks with signs and symptoms suggesting ureaplasma pneumonia who received macrolides comprised the study group.

It is estimated that 50% of patients with epilepsy have a genetic cause. The remaining 50% are idiopathic. The most common type of epilepsy is focal epilepsy, which is defined as seizures that originate in a single area of the brain. The most common type of focal epilepsy is partial epilepsy, which is defined as seizures that originate in a single area of the brain and are not associated with generalised seizures. The most common type", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Using a line of mice that are genetically homogenous apart from a 1 megabase QTL region containing the PAPPA2 gene, we bred mice homozygous for alternate QTL genotypes and collected and weighed placentae and embryos at E12.5. We used quantitative RT-PCR to measure the mRNA levels of PAPPA2, as well as mRNA levels of IGFBP-5 (PAPPA2's substrate), and PAPPA (a closely related IGFBP protease) to examine potential feedback and compensation effects. Western blotting was used to quantify PAPPA2 protein. Birth weight was measured in pregnancies allowed to proceed to parturition.\nContext 2: PAPPA2 mRNA and protein expression levels in the placenta differed by a factor of 2.5 between genotypes, but we did not find a significant difference between genotypes in embryonic PAPPA2 mRNA levels. Placental IGFBP-5 and PAPPA mRNA expression levels were not altered in response to PAPPA2 levels, and we could not detect IGFBP-5 protein in the placenta by Western blotting. The observed difference in placental PAPPA2 expression had no significant effect on placental or embryonic mass at mid-gestation, birth weight or litter size.\nContext 3: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A2 (PAPPA2) is an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) protease expressed in the placenta and upregulated in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. The mechanism linking PAPPA2 expression and pre-eclampsia and the consequences of altered PAPPA2 expression remain unknown. We previously identified PAPPA2 as a candidate gene for a quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting growth in mice and in the present study examined whether this QTL affects placental PAPPA2 expression and, in turn, placental or embryonic growth.\nContext 4: Maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is associated with increased risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and stillbirth, mediated by placental insufficiency. The maternally expressed imprinted gene PHLDA2 controls fetal growth, placental development and placental lactogen production in a mouse model. A number of studies have also demonstrated abnormally elevated placental PHLDA2 expression in human growth restricted pregnancies. This study examined whether PHLDA2 was expressed in the placenta of mice with RFM and whether PHLDA2 expression was altered in the placenta of mice with RFM and pre-eclampsia.\nContext 5: The placenta is a major site of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and is a major source of IGFs for the fetus. The placenta also produces IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that regulate IGF bioavailability. The placenta is also a major site of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) protease activity. The placenta is a major site of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and is a major source of IGFs for the fetus.

Effective therapies for post-operative ventricular dysfunction are limited. Prolonged inotrope exposure is associated with further betaAR down-regulation. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and myocardial betaAR impairment were assessed following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardioplegic arrest in a pig model. Transfer of the human beta2-adrenoceptor transgene (Adeno-beta2AR) during cardioplegic arrest was then tested as a potential therapy.\nContext 3: betaAR antagonist use in 2,575 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (1994-1996) was determined using the Cardiovascular Database and Anesthesia Information System Database. Outcome variables were postoperative stroke, coma, and transient ischemic attack. Of patients, 113 (4.4%) had postoperative neurologic complications, including stroke (n = 44), coma (n = 12), and transient ischemic attack (n = 3). Of patients, 2,296 (89%) received perioperative betaAR antagonist therapy, and 279 (11%) did not. Adverse neurologic events occurred in 3.9% (n = 90) of patients who received perioperative betaAR antagonists and 8.2% (n = 23) of patients who did not receive betaAR antagonists (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.73; p = 0.003, unadjusted.) Severe neurologic outcomes (stroke and coma) occurred in 1.9% (n = 44) of patients who received betaAR antagonists and 4.3% (n = 12) of patients who did not receive betaAR antagonists (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.83; p = 0.016).\nContext 4: beta-Adrenoceptor-blocking agents have been used for perioperative management during anaesthesia, in which selective beta1-blockers are advantageous over nonselective beta-blockers. Apart from the different affinity for beta-adrenoceptors, beta1-blockers were differentially characterized in terms of their effects on the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor system. The present study was designed to determine the effects of beta1- and beta2-blockers on the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor system in a pig model of CPB and cardioplegic arrest.\nContext 5: The present study was designed to determine the effects of beta1- and beta2-blockers on the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor system in a pig model of CPB and cardioplegic arrest.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to determine the effects of beta1- and beta2-blockers on the myocardial beta-adrenoceptor system in a pig model of CPB and cardioplegic arrest.\nContext 7: The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess the prevalence of modest (< 10-fold) decreases in baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) susceptibility and their impact on virological response to NNRTI-containing triple therapy in drug-naive individuals.\nContext 2: Nevirapine was the most commonly prescribed NNRTI (96%). Four- to 10-fold decreased susceptibility to NNRTIs was observed in > 30% of untreated individuals at baseline, an observation strongly driven by decreased susceptibility to delavirdine (22.4%). A > 10-fold decrease in susceptibility to any NNRTI was observed only rarely (< 2%). There was no association between four- and 10-fold decreased baseline susceptibility to NNRTIs and virological outcome (P > 0.05). In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors of poor virological response to NNRTI-based therapy were baseline plasma viral load and the proportion of time on therapy in the first year of follow-up. There was no relationship between the presence of previously reported mutations associated with decreased NNRTI susceptibility (at codons 135 and 283 in HIV reverse transcriptase) and virological response.\nContext 3: Nevirapine, an NNRTI used in HIV treatment, can cause hypersensitivity reactions in 6%-10% of patients. In the most serious cases (1.3%) this can manifest as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\nContext 4: Persistent pathologic N2 disease was present in 61% of patients (61 out of 100). PET N2-negative disease increased from 7% (6 out of 92) before induction therapy to 47% (36 out of 77) afterward. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of postinduction PET for identification of ypN2 disease were 59%, 55%, and 57%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that postinduction PET N2 status was not associated with ypN2 disease. Of the 39 patients with both pre- and postinduction PET N2-avidity, 25 (64%) had ypN2 disease. The 5-year overall survival was 40% for ypN2 disease versus 38% for N2-persistent disease (P =.936); the 5-year overall survival was 43% for postinduction PET N2-negative disease versus 38% for postinduction PET N2-avidity disease (P =.486).\nContext 5: The median time to progression was 3.5 years (range, 0.1-9.5 years).

Two hundred twenty-five patients were randomly allocated to placebo or abciximab before coronary intervention. Of the 215 patients who received stents and study drug, 191 (88.8%) returned for late (>/=4 months) coronary evaluation. Tissue volume, expressed as a percentage of stent volume, did not differ: 25+/-15%, 27+/-15%, and 29+/-14% for the patients in the placebo and the 12- and 24-hour abciximab groups, respectively. Lack of abciximab benefit was confirmed by quantitative coronary angiography (dichotomous restenosis: 11.6%, 18. 9%, and 19.4%; loss index: 0.33, 0.52, and 0.47, respectively, P=NS).\nContext 2: We treated patients experiencing drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), implantation of the same type of DES [homogeneous drug-eluting stent (HOMO-DES)], or implantation of a different type of DES [heterogeneous drug-eluting stent (HETERO-DES)], and compared the efficacy and safety of these procedures for the prevention of repeated in-stent restenosis (ISR).\nContext 3: Although stents reduce restenosis compared with balloon angioplasty, their long-term efficacy is limited by neointimal hyperplasia. Platelet and alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor inhibition limits neointimal proliferation in animal models of arterial injury.\nContext 4: At 6 months, quantitative computer-assisted angiographic analysis in 133 patients with stents showed a binary restenosis rate of 33.8%. Statins were being taken by 80% of the patients. There were no significant differences between the pre- or postprocedure values of CRP, SAA, or IL-6 in patients with or without in-stent restenosis.\nContext 5: The appropriateness of the use of DES in patients with diabetes mellitus is controversial. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus who received DES with those of patients with diabetes mellitus who received bare metal stents.\nContext 6: We compared the clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus who received DES with those of patients with diabetes mellitus who received bare metal stents.\nContext 7: We compared the clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus who received DES with those of patients with diabetes mellitus who received bare metal stents.\nContext 8: We compared the clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes mellitus who received DES with those of patients with diabetes mellitus who received bare metal stents.\nContext 9: We compared the", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The current study employed a canine model permitting selective intracoronary administrations of isoflurane (1) to test the hypothesis that coronary vasodilation by isoflurane is mediated by nitric oxide and (2) to evaluate the persistence of coronary vasodilation during an extended exposure to isoflurane. The coronary vasodilator reserve with dipyridamole may be impaired immediately after successful angioplasty due to reduced endothelial production or release of nitric oxide. As the vasodilator response to exogenous nitrates is enhanced by endothelium removal or inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis, an increased vasodilator response to nitrovasod", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) predicts longitudinal increases in blood pressure (BP) and new onset of hypertension in individuals with normal BP. The present study was performed to assess which arterial segment is responsible for enhanced baPWV in subclinical hypothyroidism. To analyze the relationship between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central blood pressure evaluated by augmentation index (AIx) in hypertensive patients with kidney disease. Arterial stiffness may contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This study was conducted to evaluate the independent factor of LVH and the quantification of LVH by electrocardiogram (EC", "Contexts:\nContext 1: High concentrations of methylated thiopurine metabolites, such as 6-methyl mercaptopurine, are associated with hepatotoxicity during administration of the conventional thiopurines azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in IBD patients. Metabolization of the non-conventional thiopurine 6-thioguanine does not generate 6-methyl mercaptopurine. Hence, the aim of our study was to evaluate hepatotoxicity during 6-thioguanine in IBD patients who previously failed conventional thiopurines due to 6-methyl mercaptopurine associated hepatotoxicity.\nContext 2: A retrospective single center intercept cohort study was performed of IBD patients using 6-thioguanine between January 2006 and July 2010 after failing conventional thiopurine therapy due to 6-methyl mercaptopurine associated hepatotoxicity. The primary outcome was the occurrence of 6-thioguanine induced hepatotoxicity, scaled according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.\nContext 3: Up to 20% of patients on thiopurine therapy fail to achieve adequate drug response. Many of these patients preferentially produce the toxic 6-methylmercaptopurine metabolites (6-MMP) rather than the active 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) resulting in a high 6-MMP/6-TGN ratio (>20) and increased risk of hepatotoxicity.\nContext 4: 6-Thioguanine-nucleotides seem to be the active metabolites of thiopurine therapy, and their monitoring has been considered a useful tool for optimizing response in inflammatory bowel diseases. Tioguanine (thioguanine) therapy results in much higher levels of 6-thioguanine-nucleotide levels when compared with azathioprine or mercaptopurine.\nContext 5: Nineteen patients were included. Median duration of 6-thioguanine therapy (median daily dosage 21 mg (9-24)) was 23 weeks (6-96). Hepatotoxicity did not reoccur in 15 out of 19, whereas grade 1 toxicity persisted in 4 patients (p<0.001). Median aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations decreased from 34 to 12 IU/L (p<0.001) and from 25 to 10 IU/L (p<0.001), respectively. The 6-thioguanine/6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio decreased from 0.8 to 0.2 (p<0.001). The 6-thioguanine/6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio was significantly correlated with the 6-thioguanine dose (r=0.7, p<0.001).\nContext 6: The 6-thioguanine/6-thioguanine nucleotide ratio was significantly correlated with the 6-thioguanine dose (r=0.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Tenofovir may be associated with nephrotoxicity. Several studies have shown that an early increase in urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may predict the occurrence of acute kidney injury. We investigated urine and plasma NGAL in patients on long-term treatment with nevirapine associated with either tenofovir/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine.\nContext 2: We studied 40 virologically controlled Caucasian patients on stable treatment (median >4 years) with tenofovir/emtricitabine + nevirapine (n = 20) or abacavir/lamivudine + nevirapine (n = 20), and no history of kidney disease, high blood pressure or diabetes. Plasma immunovirological parameters (NGAL and C-reactive protein) and urinary NGAL, \u03b22-microglobulin and \u03b11-microglobulin were measured during a routine clinical visit.\nContext 3: Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) is expressed by kidney tubules that are acutely damaged, but few studies have investigated the association of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) with different forms of chronic kidney disease (CKD). HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a progressive form of CKD characterized by collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and microcytic tubular dilatation that typically leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nContext 4: We assessed 48-week changes in fasting lipids and several biomarkers including serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), osteoprotegerin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), selectin E and P, adiponectin, insulin, and D-dimer in otherwise healthy, virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients randomly switched to abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine with no history of cardiovascular disease, no prior abacavir or tenofovir use, and no virological failure or AIDS during follow-up.\nContext 5: We assessed 48-week changes in fasting lipids and several biomarkers including serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), osteoprotegerin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), selectin E and P, adiponectin, insulin, and D-dimer in otherwise healthy, virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients randomly switched to abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtr", "Yes, the presence of the flanking sub-optimal splice sites is required for the assembly of splicing complexes on the exon 11 template.\nExplanation: The splice sites are the recognition sites for the spliceosome.

In contrast, some Salmonella serovars are host-specific and frequently exhibit large chromosomal rearrangements from recombination between rrn operons. One hypothesis explaining these rearrangements suggests that replichore imbalance introduced from horizontal transfer of pathogenicity islands and prophages drives chromosomal rearrangements in an attempt to improve balance.\nContext 2: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an enteropathogen that causes self-limiting diarrhea in healthy individuals, but poses a significant health threat to vulnerable populations. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of Salmonella-induced diarrhea has been hampered by the lack of a suitable mouse model. After a dose of oral kanamycin, Salmonella-infected congenic BALB/c.D2(NrampG169) mice, which carry a wild-type Nramp1 gene, develop clear manifestations of diarrhea. We used this model to elucidate the pathophysiology of Salmonella-induced diarrhea.\nContext 3: The basic molecular mechanisms that govern the search for DNA homology and subsequent homologous pairing during genetic recombination are not understood. RecA is the central homologous recombination protein of Escherichia coli; because several RecA homologues have been identified in eukaryotic cells, it is likely that the mechanisms employed by RecA are conserved throughout evolution. Analysis of the kinetics of the homologous search and pairing reactions catalyzed by RecA should therefore provide insights of general relevance into the mechanisms by which macromolecules locate, and interact with, specific DNA targets.\nContext 4: By measuring recombination directly in the individuals under selection, we found that recombination in the host population was increased after 11 generations of coevolution. Detailed insights into genotypic and phenotypic changes occurring during the coevolution experiment furthermore helped us to reconstruct the coevolutionary dynamics that were associated with this increase in recombination frequency. As coevolved lines maintained higher genetic diversity than control lines, and because there was no evidence for heterozygote advantage or for a plastic response of recombination to infection, the observed increase in recombination most likely represented an adaptive host response under Red Queen dynamics.\nContext 5: This hypothesis was directly tested by comparing the naturally-occurring chromosomal arrangement types to the theoretically possible arrangement types. The results of this analysis showed that the observed chromosomal rearrangements are consistent with the hypothesis that the rearrangements are the result of a host response to infection.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that the host response to infection is a major determinant of the chromosomal rearrangements that occur during Salmonella infection. The results also suggest that the host response to infection is a major determinant of the chromosomal rearrangements that occur during Salmonella infection.\nContext 7: The results of this study suggest that the host response to infection is a major determinant of the chromosomal rearrangements that occur during Salmonella infection. The results also suggest that the host response to infection is a major determinant of the chromosomal rearr", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Macrophage scavenger receptors facilitate the uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL), formation of foam cells, and development of atherosclerosis. Given that proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, can modulate the macrophage foaming process, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the synthetic retinoic acid receptor-alpha/beta-specific agonist Am80, which is also an IL-6 inhibitor, can modulate macrophage lipid accumulation and foam cell formation.\nContext 2: Am80 suppressed IL-6 production induced by 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or angiotensin II in mouse Raw264 macrophages. It also suppressed expression of the 2 major scavenger receptors (scavenger receptor-A [SR-A] and CD36), in part by inhibiting IL-6, and inhibited macrophage foam cell formation. Systemic administration of Am80 led to reductions in the areas of atherosclerotic lesions and foam cell accumulation in the aortas of apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice and reduced serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1beta without affecting body weights, serum lipid profiles or IL-10 levels.\nContext 3: The majority of samples fell into the retinopathy class 3 (n = 12) or 4 (n = 13). The level of IL-6 increased from 68.9 \u00b1 46.8 pg/ml to 102.7 \u00b1 94.1 pg/ml, and IL-8 increased from 165.1 \u00b1 136.0 pg/ml to 521.0 \u00b1 870.9 pg/ml (mean \u00b1 S.D., nonsignificant change: normality test followed with Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test). According to the neovascularization activity, the samples fell into grade 1 (n = 7), 2 (n = 12) or 3 (n = 7). In IL-6, there was a statistically significant increase (P <.05) from grade 2 to 3: 58.6 \u00b1 40.3 pg/ml and 158.4 \u00b1 102.5 pg/ml, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed with Dunn's Method). The level of IL-8 was as follows: in grade 1: 118.3 \u00b1 87.1 pg/ml and 165.1 \u00b1 136.0 pg/ml, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed with Dunn's Method); in grade 2: 165.1 \u00b1 136.0 pg/ml and 521.0 \u00b1 870.9 pg/ml, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed with Dunn's Method); and in grade 3: 165.1 \u00b1 136.0 pg/ml and 521.0 \u00b1 870.9 pg/ml, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed with Dunn's Method).\nContext", "#1: No, preoperative nonlinear behavior in heart rate variability does not predict morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n#2: No, preoperative nonlinear behavior in heart rate variability does not predict morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n#3: No, preoperative nonlinear behavior in heart rate variability does not predict morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n#4: No, preoperative nonlinear behavior in heart rate variability does not predict morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n#5: No, preoperative nonlinear behavior in heart rate variability does not predict morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n#6: No, preoperative nonlinear behavior in heart rate variability does", "Yes, innate Effector-Memory T-Cell Activation regulates Post-Thrombotic Vein Wall Inflammation and Thrombus Resolution.\nThe study investigated the recruitment, activation, and inflammatory activity of T cells in deep vein thrombosis and its consequences for venous thrombus resolution.\nImmune cells play an important role during the generation and resolution of thrombosis.

The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of at least three of the following: abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure.

The authors reviewed their own experience with this patient population. They found that patients with severe oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were at no greater operative risk than patients who received aneurysm resection while on standard cardiopulmonary bypass. The authors hypothesized that patients undergoing DHCA with or without retrograde cerebral perfusion during aneurysm repair were at no greater operative risk than patients who received aneurysm resection while on standard cardiopulmonary bypass.\n#2: No, oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Alignment of the glenoid component with the scapula during total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is challenging due to glenoid erosion and lack of both bone stock and guiding landmarks. We determined the extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid. Also, we investigated whether excessive erosion of the glenoid is associated with perforation of the glenoid vault.\nContext 2: Thirty-six shoulder arthroplasties (12 TSAs, 24 RSAs) were analyzed, of which 18 procedures (6 TSAs, 12 RSAs) were executed using preoperative 3D planning and patient-specific guides to position the central guide pin for glenoid component implantation. In 9 cases, the glenoid anatomy was severely distorted through wear or previous surgery. The inclination of the glenoid component was measured by 2 observers, using the angle between the glenoid baseplate and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa (angle \u03b2) on postoperative radiographs.\nContext 3: The relationship between glenoid version angle and rotator cuff pathology has been described. However, the effect of glenoid version angle on rotator cuff pathology is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an impact of glenoid version angle on rotator cuff pathology.\nContext 4: Six cadaveric shoulders were tested for glenohumeral rotational range of motion and translation using a custom shoulder testing system and the Microscribe 3DLX. The path of glenohumeral articulation was measured by calculating the humeral head center with respect to the glenoid articular surface at maximal internal rotation, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and maximal external rotation. Data were recorded for vented intact shoulders, shoulders with arthroscopically created type II superior labral anterior posterior lesions, and shoulders with arthroscopically repaired superior labral anterior posterior lesions.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of 3-dimensional (3D) preoperative planning and patient-specific instrument (PSI) guidance of glenoid component positioning on its inclination in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n    - The extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid is minimal.\n    - The extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid is moderate.\n    - The extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid is high.\n    - The extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid is low.\n    - The extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid is moderate.\n    - The extent to which the implant position is governed by the preoperative erosion of the glenoid is high.\n    - The extent", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Hepatocyte proliferation induced by TCPOBOP was associated with a stronger proliferative response and earlier S phase entry in c-jun(\u0394li) mice, compared to WT animals. Moreover, silencing of c-jun in the liver of CD-1 mice caused increased hepatocyte proliferation. A stronger hepatocyte proliferative response of c-jun(\u0394li) mice was observed also following treatment with a ligand of thyroid hormone receptor. Finally, loss of c-jun did not inhibit the development of HCC induced by DENA and promoted by TCPOBOP.\nContext 2: Mice lacking c-jun in the liver display impaired regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH), and were reported to be more resistant to chemically-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the role of c-jun in normal and preneoplastic hepatocyte proliferation induced by ligands of nuclear receptors, which cause liver hyperplasia in the absence of cell loss/death.\nContext 3: The effect of 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) on hepatocyte proliferation was determined in c-jun conditional knockout (c-jun(\u0394li)) or in mouse liver where c-jun has been silenced. To study the role of c-jun in HCC development, c-jun(\u0394li) and WT mice were given diethylnitrosamine (DENA) followed by repeated injections of TCPOBOP.\nContext 4: Hepatocytes (Huh 7 cells, HepG2 cells, and primary rat hepatocytes) were rendered steatotic by incubation with oleic acid. Apoptosis was assessed morphologically and biochemically by caspase activity. TRAIL receptor regulation was examined using immunoblot analysis and siRNA for targeted knockdown. c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibition was attained with SP600125.\nContext 5: In wild type mice, hepatic MCP-1 protein levels increased 4-6\u00a0h after PH, and elevated plasma MCP-1 levels were detected 12\u00a0h after PH. Hepatocyte proliferation was comparable in MCP-1 knockout and wild type mice, as was the expression of macrophage-derived cytokines, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, and levels of phosphorylated STAT3. The number of CCR2(+) cells in the liver was increased in MCP-1 knockout mice, but not in wild type mice, 12\u00a0h after PH. MCP-1 knockout mice were more resistant to TCPOBOP-induced hepatocyte proliferation than wild type mice.\nContext 6: Hepatocyte proliferation was increased in MCP-1 knockout mice, but not in wild type mice, 12\u00a0h after PH.

Current assumptions rely on the analysis of small groups of human temporal bones post mortem or from psychophysical identification of cochlear \"dead regions\" in\u00a0vivo, but a comprehensive study assessing the correlation between audiometric thresholds and cellular damage within the cochlea is lacking.\nContext 2: Similar audiometric profiles reflected widely different cellular damage in the cochlea. In our diverse group of patients, audiometric thresholds tended to be more influenced by hair cell loss than by neuronal loss or strial atrophy. Spearman's correlation coefficient across frequencies was at most 0.7 and often below 0.5, with 1.0 indicating perfect correlation.\nContext 3: A total of 131 human temporal bones from 85 adult individuals (ages 19-92 years, median 69 years) with sensorineural hearing loss due to various etiologies were analyzed. Cytocochleograms - which quantify loss of hair cells, neurons, and strial atrophy along the length of the cochlea - were compared with subjects' latest available audiometric tests prior to death (time range 5\u00a0h-22 years, median 24 months). The Greenwood function and the equivalent rectangular bandwidth were used to infer, from cytocochleograms, cochlear locations corresponding to frequencies tested in clinical audiograms. Correlation between audiometric thresholds at clinically tested frequencies and cell type-specific damage in those frequency regions was examined by calculating Spearman's correlation coefficients.\nContext 4: Pure tone audiometry showed U-shaped curves with moderate to severe degrees of hearing impairment confirmed by brainstem evoked response audiometry. Transient evoked and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were completely absent in all affected family members whereas word recognition scores were up to 95%.\nContext 5: Acoustic modulation detection thresholds (MDTs), averaged across the subject group, were significantly better for rates of 500 pps/ch compared to the other rates examined for stimuli presented at MCL.

In our diverse group of patients, audiometric thresholds tended to be more", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Vascular homeostasis and response to injury are dependent on the coordinated activity of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF). VEGF signaling is mediated by VEGF receptors 1 (VEGFR1) and 2 (VEGFR2). VEGF also binds to extracellular matrix (ECM) and neuropilin (NP), a cell surface glycoprotein that enhances VEGF binding to VEGFR2 while inhibiting VEGF-VEGFR1 interactions. Proteases such as neutrophil elastase release VEGF bound to ECM; however, this results in proteolytic processing of VEGF to a smaller species termed VEGF fragment (VEGFf). We hypothesized that the generation and presence of VEGFf would have significant effects on the binding distribution of VEGF.\nContext 2: We show that VEGFf, unlike VEGF, does not bind ECM, fibronectin, or NP-1. Using computational simulations, we find that excess VEGFf can lead to increased binding of VEGF to VEGFR2 through VEGFf binding to VEGFR1 and subsequent liberation of NP-1. We show experimentally that VEGF-induced migration has a biphasic response to conversion of VEGF to VEGFf. Simulations suggest that a simple change in VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 complexes are unlikely to be responsible and that a more complex integration of signals is more likely involved.\nContext 3: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is composed of ligands and receptors which regulate cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration. Some of these functions involve regulation by the extracellular milieu, including binding proteins and other extracellular matrix proteins. However, the functions and exact nature of these interactions remain incomplete.\nContext 4: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization following ligand binding controls EGFR downstream pathway signaling activity. Internalized EGFR is poly-ubiquitinated by Cbl to promote lysosome-mediated degradation and signal downregulation. ACK1 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that interacts with ubiquitinated EGFR to facilitate EGFR degradation. Dynamic reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton controlled by the actin related protein (Arp)2/3 complex is important in regulating EGFR endocytosis and vesicle trafficking. We hypothesized that ACK1 and Arp2/3 complex are involved in the regulation of EGFR internalization and degradation.\nContext 5: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that is activated by binding of its ligand, epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGFR is a key regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The EGFR is also a target for many therapeutic agents, including monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. The EGFR is internalized following ligand binding and undergoes endocytosis. Internalized EGFR is poly-ubiquitinated by Cbl to promote lysosome-mediated degradation and signal down", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation is central to the development of vascular diseases, including hypertension, which is regulated by numerous hormones and humoral factors. Our previous study showed that the stimulatory effect of norepinephrine on VSMC proliferation is inhibited by D1-like receptors and the D3 dopamine receptor, a member of the D2-like receptor family. Insulin is a proliferative hormone but it is not known if there is any interaction between insulin and D1-like receptors. We hypothesized that Dl-like receptors may have an inhibitory effect on the insulin-induced VSMC proliferation; aberrant insulin and Dl-like receptor functions could be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension.\nContext 2: We previously showed that aldosterone induces insulin resistance in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Because insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) affects insulin signaling, we hypothesized that aldosterone induces vascular insulin resistance and remodeling via upregulation of IGF1R and its hybrid insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor.\nContext 3: Mitogenic activity of insulin and insulin analogues and the involvement of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is still a controversial issue. We compared levels of the proteins IGF-1R and insulin receptor (InsR) in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells from healthy donors and assessed the downstream signalling and growth-promoting activity of insulin and insulin analogues.\nContext 4: Insulin increased VSMC proliferation in immortalized aortic A10 cells, determined by [H]-thymidine incorporation. Although the D1-like receptor, by itself, had no effect on VSMC proliferation, stimulation with fenoldopam, a D1-like receptor agonist, inhibited the stimulatory effect of insulin. The inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on insulin-mediated VSMC proliferation was receptor specific, because its effect could be blocked by SCH23390, a D1-like receptor antagonist. Fenoldopam also inhibited insulin receptor mRNA and protein expression, which was time dependent and concentration dependent. A PKC or MAP kinase inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of fenoldopam on insulin receptor expression, indicating that PKC and MAP kinase were involved in the signaling pathway.\nContext 5: We examined the effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). A 24-hour treatment with insulin increased AT1 receptor mRNA expression in VSMCs. The effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression was blocked by the D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390. The effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression was also blocked by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. The effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression was not blocked by the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059. The effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression was not blocked by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X.

This response depends on the intensity of the light stimulus and its distance from the eyes and is not affected by simultaneous tactile or auditory stimulation. However, in some patients we observe different P100 latencies, at different intervals of testing, without lesions of the optic tracts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a loud meaningful", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Statin use prior to cardiac surgery has been reported to improve outcomes in the postoperative period because of other effects apart from decreasing lipid levels. Objective of the study was to analyse mortality and acute renal failure (ARF) during the cardiac surgery postoperative period in patients treated with or without statins.\nContext 2: This prospective cohort study comprised adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at 11 institutions in the Andalusian community from March 2008 to July 2012 included in the ARIAM adult cardiac surgery project. We performed a first analysis in the whole cohort and in a second analysis statin users prior to surgery were pair matched with non-users according to their propensity score based on demographics, comorbidities, medication and surgical data. We analysed differences in outcomes, ARF, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and a composite end point with mortality or major morbidity in both groups.\nContext 3: Statins are widely prescribed to patients with atherosclerosis. A retrospective database analysis was used to examine the role of preoperative statin use in hospital mortality, for patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG.)\nContext 4: Of 1845 patients, 722 were receiving preoperative statin therapy. One hundred twenty patients developed postoperative ARDS. Frequencies of ARDS among those receiving statin therapy versus those who were not was 7.2% and 6.1%, respectively (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.83-1.75; P = 0.330). Neither the stratified propensity score analysis (pooled OR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.60-1.43) nor matched analysis (OR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.48-1.27) identified a statistically significant association between preoperative statin administration and postoperative ARDS. When compared to matched controls, patients who developed postoperative ARDS did not differ in mortality (7.7% vs 8.8%, P = 0.51), hospital length of stay (21 days vs 15 days, P = 0.21), or ventilator-free days (24 days vs 25 days, P = 0.62).\nContext 5: Statin therapy in nonsurgical patient populations is associated with a significant reduction in adverse cardiovascular events, including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. However, the effect of statin therapy on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of statin therapy on the risk of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of statin therapy on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of statin therapy on the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of statin therapy on the risk of acute kidney injury", "Question: Does biological response modifiers in photochemically pathogen-reduced versus untreated apheresis platelet concentrate??\nExplanation: The study was designed to evaluate the impact of pathogen reduction on the content and impact of biological response modifiers in apheresis platelet concentrates (PCs). The study was conducted in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center study. Apheresis PCs were obtained from 20 healthy donors and were treated with pathogen reduction (PR) technology (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) or nontreated PCs. The PR-treated PCs were irradiated with 1.5 J/cm2 of 254 nm UVA light. The impact of PR on the content of biological response modifiers was evaluated", "Contexts:\nContext 1: It is debated whether brain death (BD) causes transient functional ischemia. In this investigation we used monophasic action potential (AP) recording during BD as a sensitive means to assess: (i) whether ischemia was present; and (ii) the effect of BD on a subsequent ischemia-reperfusion challenge.\nContext 2: Twelve Yorkshire piglets were subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass, 30 minutes of cooling, 100 minutes of circulatory arrest at 15 degrees C, and 40 minutes of rewarming. Five animals received a bolus of 60 mg/kg of CY-1503 and an infusion (3 mg/kg per hour) for 24 hours from reperfusion (group O), and 7 randomly selected control piglets received saline solution (group C). Body weight and total body water content were evaluated 3 hours and 24 hours after reperfusion by a bio-impedance technique. Neurologic recovery of animals was evaluated daily by neurologic deficit score (0 = normal, 500 = brain death) and overall performance categories (1 = normal, 5 = brain death). The brain was fixed in situ on the fourth postoperative day and examined by histologic score (0 = normal, 5+ = necrosis) in a blinded fashion.\nContext 3: Forty-seven male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 7 min of CA and 3 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In protocol I animals were randomized to receive either 70% or 40% argon ventilation 1 h after successful CPR or no argon-treatment. Animals of the second protocol also received 1 h of 70% argon ventilation or no argon treatment but were randomized to a group receiving the K(ATP) channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD). For all animals a neurological deficit score (NDS) was calculated daily for seven days following the experiment before the animals were killed and the brains harvested for histopathological analyses.\nContext 4: Increasing human and laboratory evidence suggests that post-resuscitative brain hypothermia reduces the pathologic consequences of brain ischemia. Using a swine model of prolonged cardiac arrest, this investigation sought to determine whether unilateral hypothermic carotid bypass was capable of inducing selective brain hypothermia and reducing neurohistologic damage.\nContext 5: Giving glucose before hypoxic ischemia worsens brain injury in the rat. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the addition of glucose to the hypoxic ischemic insult would improve outcome.\nContext 6: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the addition of glucose to the hypoxic ischemic insult would improve outcome.\nContext 7: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the addition of glucose to the hypoxic ischemic insult would improve outcome.\nContext 8: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the addition of glucose to the hypoxic ischemic insult would improve outcome.\nContext 9: The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the addition of glucose to the hypoxic ischemic insult would improve outcome.\nContext 10: The purpose of this investigation was to", "Question: Does the menopausal transition appear to accelerate age-related increases in arterial stiffness??\nExplanation: The menopausal transition is a period of rapid change in the hormonal milieu that occurs during the transition from reproductive to non-reproductive life.

Mediolateral and median episiotomy, advanced maternal age, vaginal operative delivery, higher fetal birth weight and abnormal cephalic presentation were associated with severe lacerations.\nContext 3: Four hundred and forty-eight women with VB and a mean age of 24\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0\u00a0years with rare (5\u00a0%) third- or fourth-degree lacerations were assessed. During the second stage of labor, 270/448 (60\u00a0%) had perineal measurements. Mean antepartum PB length was 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0cm, with a maximum mean PB length (PBmax) during the second stage of 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0cm, an increase of 65\u00a0%. The change in PB length (\u0394PB) from antepartum to 6\u00a0months postpartum was a net decrease (-0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20091.02\u00a0cm). PB change and PBmax were not associated with perineal lacerations or outcomes postpartum (all p\u2009>\u20090.05).\nContext 4: The mean (sd) patient age was 43.6 (16.8) years and 66% of patients were female. The mean (sd) pre- and postoperative RRF values were not significantly different (37.6 [12.3] % vs 38.4 [13.6] %; P = 0.31). Patients stratified by low, medium and high preoperative function showed no significant change in postoperative RRF (P = 0.53, 0.39 and 0.77, respectively). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.98) and lower preoperative RRF (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97) predicted improvement in RRF of >7%, after adjustment.\nContext 5: A total of 266 women who underwent midurethral sling procedures with at least follow-up greater than 6\u00a0months were included. The mean (sd) preoperative RRF was 37.6 (12.3) % and the mean (sd) postoperative RRF was 38.4 (13.6) %. The mean (sd) change in RRF was 0.8 (12.3) %. The mean (sd) change in RRF was 0.8 (12.3) % for women with a preoperative RRF of 30\u00a0% or less and 1.1 (12.3) % for women with a preoperative RRF of 30\u00a0% or more (P = 0.03).\nContext 6: The mean (sd) preoperative R", "Question: Is cT-guided needle lung biopsy possible during apneic oxygenation : a case series??\nYes, it is possible to perform CT-guided lung biopsy during apneic oxygenation. The risk of pneumothorax is low, but it is important to be aware of the risk factors for pneumothorax and to be prepared for it.\nContext 1: It can be difficult to perform CT guided biopsy of small pulmonary nodules especially if the position is behind a costa or close to the diaphragm and respiratory movements may hamper the procedure. During apneic oxygenation with a pulmonary standstill these movements can be hindered.\nContext 2: Six patients with decreased lung function and suspicious lung nod", "Question: Are better reporting and greater homogeneity in outcome measures seen in randomized trial protocols when guidelines exist??\nExplanation: The Cochrane Collaboration has developed a set of guidelines for reporting randomized trials.

With adjustment for age, gender, race, and insurance class, referred patients were significantly more likely to have high triage acuity designations, higher rates of very abnormal vital signs, and higher admission rates, compared with patients who were self-referred. Referred patients were more likely to undergo testing (", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Studies have shown that erythrocyte membranes are present within necrotic cores in atherosclerotic plaques, and that circulating erythrocytes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have increased total cholesterol content (CEM). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) binds to erythrocytes and during intraplaque haemorrhage it is released into the plaque and thus may contribute to inflammatory cascade and atherosclerotic plaque instability. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that erythrocyte membrane IL-8 is elevated in patients with ACS compared with those with chronic stable angina (CSA).\nContext 2: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the most common forms of heart disease. Recent studies have shown that interleukin (IL)-8 plays a key role in the development of atherosclerotic plaques, but the relationship between the common genetic variants of IL-8 and ACS has not been extensively studied.\nContext 3: Consecutive patients who presented with CSA (n = 120, 92 men, 62 +/- 9 years), ACS (n = 118, 90 men, 62 +/- 10 years) or with chest pain who had normal coronary arteries (n = 36, 26 men, 60 +/- 7 years), were studied prospectively. IL-8 concentrations in erythrocyte membranes (rIL-8) and in plasma (pIL-8), C-reactive protein (CRP) and CEM were measured. rIL-8 levels [mean +/- 1 SD (standard deviation)] were higher in ACS (102.9 +/- 70.1 pg/mL) compared with CSA (44.7 +/- 22.8 pg/mL) (P < 0.001). No difference in pIL-8 levels between the two coronary artery disease groups was observed (P = 0.280). Serum CRP levels were correlated with rIL-8 levels (r = 0.294, P < 0.001); no association was found between CRP and pIL-8 levels (r = 0.025, P = 0.706). Further, rIL-8 had an independent association with ACS, when CRP and CEM were taken into consideration.\nContext 4: Release of progenitor cells is observed during inflammatory conditions and contributes to neovascularization. We, therefore, investigated the relationship between IL-8 and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with ACS.\nContext 5: The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between IL-8 and VEGF expression in patients with ACS.\nContext 6: The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between IL-8 and VEGF expression in patients with ACS.\nContext 7: The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between IL-8 and VEGF expression in patients with ACS.\nContext 8: The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between IL-8 and VEGF expression in patients with ACS.\nContext 9: The present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between IL-", "Yes, cecal ligation and puncture-induced murine sepsis causes lung injury.\nExplanation: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis.

The mean cortical thickness was 1.5 mm (SD 0.4 mm) in the atypical group and 1.3 mm (SD 0.4 mm) in the control group. The difference in cortical thickness between the two groups was not significant (p = 0.2). The difference in cortical thickness between the ipsi- and contralateral femurs in patients with an atypical fracture was not significant (p = 0.2). The difference in cortical thickness between the two groups was not significant (", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The association has been established between the disorder of carbohydrate metabolism and liver cancer. However, little is known regarding the impact of concurrent hyperglycemia on prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed at solving this problem.\nContext 2: This was a retrospective study of 701 patients with newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) seen between January 2005 and June 2011 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. This patient cohort was a part of the global HCC BRIDGE study, which is a large longitudinal study of HCC determining the real-world experience of HCC characteristics, management and patient outcomes. We defined significant metformin exposure as continuation of this agent at least 90 d beyond diagnosis of HCC, and compared survival of diabetic patients on metformin to diabetic patients not on metformin and non-diabetics.\nContext 3: Presently, the role of liver resection (LR) for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. However, in many regions worldwide, LR remains the only treatment modality available to such patients which offers the possibility of long-term cure. The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with multifocal HCC after LR.\nContext 4: The 5-year survival rate of patients with\u00a0hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was very low because of invasion and metastasis in the early stage. Biomarkers might help predict early occurrence of invasion and metastasis. Accumulating evidence has shown that deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC1) may be considered as a metastasis suppressor gene in numerous solid and hematological cancers.\u00a0However, its prognostic role and mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood.\nContext 5: We evaluated clinical files of 520 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma admitted from 1994 to 2002 to our Liver Unit.

Resin composite overlays were constructed and cemented to the surfaces using either Panavia F (Kuraray) or Bistite II DC (Tokuyama) resin cements mediated by their respective one-step or two-step self-etch adhesives. Experimental groups were prepared in the same way, except that the additional layer of a low-viscosity bonding resin (LVBR, Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus, 3M ESPE) was placed on the bonded dentine surface before luting the overlays with the respective resin cements. The bonded assemblies were stored for 24 h in water at 37 degrees C and subsequently prepared for microtensile bond strength testing. Beams of approximately 0.8 mm(2) were tested in tension at 0.5 mm/min in a universal tester. Fractured surfaces were examined under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additional specimens were prepared and examined with TEM using a silver nitrate-staining technique.\nContext 3: The aim of this study was to analyze the survival rate and failure mode of IPS leucite-reinforced ceramic onlays and partial veneer crowns regarding thickness under the following clinical conditions: vital versus nonvital teeth, tooth location, and type of opposing dentition.\nContext 4: This study evaluated the effect of ionizing radiations on resin-dentin interface in terms of marginal adaptation and micro-tensile bond strength under thermocycling and mechanical loading.\nContext 5: Flat middle coronal dentin surfaces with a central region of caries-affected dentin surrounded by sound dentin were bonded with Adper Scotchbond 1 after: (1) etching with 35% H3PO4; (2) etching with 0.1M EDTA and (3) 35% H3PO4-etching followed by 5% chlorhexidine application. Resin composite build-ups were constructed incrementally and trimmed to yield hourglass specimens (0.8mm2 bonded area) that contained sound or caries-affected dentin (confirmed after debonding by microhardness measurements - KHN). Bonded specimens were tensioned at 0.5 mm/min in a universal testing machine. Failure mode was observed under SEM. The specimens were also examined with TEM.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ionizing radiations on resin-dentin interface in terms of marginal adaptation and micro-tensile bond strength under thermocycling and mechanical loading.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ionizing radiations on resin-dentin interface in terms of marginal adaptation and micro-tensile bond strength under thermocycling and mechanical loading.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ionizing radiations on resin-dentin interface in terms of marginal adaptation and micro-tensile bond strength", "Question: Is rocuronium associated with an increased risk of reintubation in patients with soft tissue infections??\nExplanation: The study was conducted to determine the risk factors associated with reintubation in adult patients with soft tissue infections.

In contrast to hs-CRP and fibrinogen, SAA as well as cytokine levels were not significantly associated with stenosis. SAA (P=0.0003) and diabetes (P=0.0002) were strong predictors of apoA-I concentration independent of age, gender, BMI, smoking, CRP, as well as IL-6 in a multiple regression model. High SAA (P=0.0067) and TG (P=0.0123) were significant predictors of apoA-I/HDL-C ratio. However, SAA was not independently related to HDL-C.\nContext 2: Lipids, lipoproteins, and HDL particles were measured on and off treatment in 123 subjects of the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study. Patients were assigned to 4 treatment groups, simvastatin-niacin, simvastatin-niacin-antioxidant vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and placebo. Subjects were followed for 3 years on treatment and then for 2 months off treatment. Simvastatin-niacin significantly increased the 2 large apoA-I-containing HDL subpopulations, alpha1 and prealpha1, and significantly decreased the 2 smallest particles, prebeta1 and alpha3, compared with values obtained from the same patients off treatment. Adding antioxidant vitamins to the lipid-modifying agents blunted these effects (not significant). A significant negative correlation (r=-0.235; P<0.01) between the changes in alpha1 HDL particle concentration and coronary artery stenosis was noted. Subjects in the third tertile (157% increase in alpha1) had no progression of stenosis in the 3-year follow-up period, whereas subjects in the first tertile (15% decrease in alpha1) had an average of 2.1% increase in stenosis.\nContext 3: To determine the relationship between severity of stenosis and hemodynamic significance in calcified coronary arteries.\nContext 4: All HDL vascular assays were impaired in patients compared with controls.

The serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level is not a reliable test for the follow-up of patients at high risk for remnant/recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The serum Tg level is not a reliable test for the follow-up of patients at high risk for remnant/recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma because it is unreliable in patients who have positive anti-Tg antibodies. Furthermore, a growing number of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma have elevated Tg levels but no detectable disease on radioiodine scanning or other imaging studies. The serum Tg level is not a reliable test for the follow-up of patients at high risk for remnant/recurrent differentiated thyroid carcinoma because it is unreliable in patients", "Question: Is osteopontin a key player for local adipose tissue macrophage proliferation in obesity??\nYes, osteopontin is a key player for local adipose tissue macrophage proliferation in obesity. Osteopontin is a secreted protein that is highly upregulated in adipose tissue of obese and has repeatedly been shown to be functionally involved in adipose-tissue inflammation and metabolic sequelae. In the present work, we aimed at unveiling both the role of osteopontin in human monocyte and macrophage proliferation as well as the impact of osteopontin deficiency on local macrophage proliferation in a mouse model for diet-induced obesity.\nOsteopontin is a secreted protein", "definitely yes\nExplanation: Glucose is the preferred fuel for cancer cells. Therefore, there is some debate about the potential stimulation of tumour metabolism induced by a glucose-based total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in cancer patients. We investigated the uptake of [18]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) through the positron emission tomography of the healthy liver and of the tumour in 12 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. We determined whether FDG uptake by the tumour in fasting conditions was affected by the subsequent administration of a glucose-based (GTPN) or a lipid-based (LTPN) containing glucose 4 mg/kg/min or lipid 2 mg/kg", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The ADPase activity was significantly reduced, to approximately 50% of pretreatment value, 4--40 weeks after 10--16 Gy single-dose irradiation and at 44 weeks after 20 x 2 Gy. No dose--effect relationship was found. An approximately fourfold increase in glomerular fibrinogen/fibrin staining was observed at 1 year after irradiation. This increase was not influenced by treating the mice with daily, oral clopidogrel, a platelet ADP receptor antagonist, which reduced platelet aggregation by more than 75%. Radiation-induced impairment of glomerular filtration was also not affected by the clopidogrel treatment.\nContext 2: Clopidogrel decreased MCP-1 expression in the carotid artery at 4 weeks after irradiation. Expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, thrombomodulin, tissue factor and eNOS was unchanged in atorvastatin and clopidogrel-treated mice. Neither drug inhibited either age-related or radiation-induced atherosclerosis. Furthermore, loss of the inflammatory mediator CD40L did not influence the development of age-related and radiation-induced atherosclerosis.\nContext 3: We previously showed that irradiating the carotid arteries of ApoE(-/-) mice accelerated the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory and thrombotic atherosclerotic lesions. In this study we investigated the potential of anti-inflammatory (atorvastatin, CD40L knockout) and anti-thrombotic (clopidogrel) intervention strategies to inhibit radiation-induced atherosclerosis.\nContext 4: To assess the effects of kidney irradiation on glomerular adenosine diphosphatase (ADPase) activity and intraglomerular microthrombus formation, and their correlation to the development of renal functional impairment.\nContext 5: The results of the IMPACT-R ADP-test were highly variable throughout healthy subjects. The administration of a high clopidogrel loading dose resulted in a small but significant increase in surface coverage but 61.9% of the patients were still identified as clopidogrel nonresponder. In contrast, optical aggregometry and VASP-analysis identified 24% and 33% of these patients as a clopidogrel nonresponder, respectively. Head-to-head comparison with optical aggregometry in 451 patients showed only a modest correlation between both methods (r approximately 0.5).

In the present work we described the crystal structure of LJ0536, a serine cinnamoyl esterase produced by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2.\nContext 2: We crystallized LJ0536 in the apo form and in three substrate-bound complexes. The structure showed a canonical \u03b1/\u03b2 fold characteristic of esterases, and the enzyme is dimeric. Two classical serine esterase motifs (GlyXSerXGly) can be recognized from the amino acid sequence, and the structure revealed that the catalytic triad of the enzyme is formed by Ser(106), His(225), and Asp(197), while the other motif is non-functional. In all substrate-bound complexes, the aromatic acyl group of the ester compound was bound in the deepest part of the catalytic pocket. The binding pocket also contained an unoccupied area that could accommodate larger ligands. The structure revealed a prominent inserted \u03b1/\u03b2 subdomain of 54 amino acids, from which multiple contacts to the aromatic acyl groups of the substrates are made. Inserts of this size are seen in other esterases, but the secondary structure topology of this subdomain of LJ0536 is unique to this enzyme and its closest homolog (Est1E) in the Protein Databank.\nContext 3: Many enzymes of industrial interest are not in the market since they are bio-produced as bacterial inclusion bodies, believed to be biologically inert aggregates of insoluble protein.\nContext 4: We have cloned and overexpressed the feruloyl esterase module from a 5 domain xylanase, Xyn10B from Clostridium thermocellum. The native structure at 1.6 A resolution has been solved with selenomethionine multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion and refined to a final R(free) of 17.8%. The structure of a hydrolytically inactive mutant, S954A, in complex with the reaction product ferulic acid has been refined at a resolution of 1.4 A with an R(free) of 16.0%.\nContext 5: The crystal structures of the enzyme complexed with glutamate and with a competitive inhibitor, Glu-hydroxamate, have been determined to 1.8 A and 2.0 A resolution, respectively.

Mean serum selenium among non-anemic and anemic adults was 1.60 and 1.51 micromol l(-1) (P=0.0003). The prevalence of anemia among adults in the lowest to highest quartiles of serum selenium was 18.3, 9.5, 9.7 and 6.9%, respectively (P=0.0005). The proportion of adults in the lowest quartile of selenium among those who were non-anemic or who had anemia due to nutritional causes, chronic inflammation, renal disease or unexplained anemia was 9.9, 27.5, 17.5, 24.0 and 15.4%, respectively. An increase in log(e) selenium was associated with a reduced risk of anemia (odds ratio per one standard deviation increase 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.97, P=0.03), adjusting for age, race, education, body mass index and chronic diseases.\nContext 3: Examination of the relationship between serum selenium and hematological indices in NHANES III.\nContext 4: At study entry, APACHE II score and demographics were identical in both groups. The mean levels of TSH, free tri-iodithyronine and total T3, as well as plasma selenium and selenium-dependent peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, were decreased. Plasma selenium and GSH-Px activity were normalized on days 3, 7 and 14 in patients receiving selenium (n=21), but remained below normal in the control patients. Patients receiving selenium had a better clinical outcome and thyroid hormone levels normalized earlier. Thyroid hormone levels increased in patients who showed clinical improvement, independent of selenium levels or selenium substitution.\nContext 5: Mean hemoglobin +/- SD was 11.5 +/- 2.1 g/dL with a 29.4% prevalence of anemia. Mean serum ferritin was 58 +/- 41.1 ug/L with a 32.1% prevalence of iron deficiency. The overall prevalence rate of iron deficiency anemia was 18.0%. Prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia was highest among those 31-50 years of age, and lowest among those 51-70 years of age. The prevalence of anemia was 18.0% in the 31-50 year age group, 15.0% in the 51-70 year age group, and 12.0% in the 71-90 year age group.

These changes affect the reproductive performance of rams, impairing semen quality and modifying hormonal profiles. Also, the antioxidant defence systems seem to be modulated by melatonin secretion, and shows seasonal variations. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of melatonin and testosterone in ram seminal plasma and their variations between the breeding and non-breeding seasons. In addition, we analyzed the possible correlations between these hormones and the antioxidant enzyme defence system activity.\nContext 2: All samples presented measurable quantities of hormones and antioxidant enzymes. Both hormones showed monthly variations, with a decrease after the winter solstice and a rise after the summer solstice that reached the maximum levels in October-November, and a marked seasonal variation (P < 0.01) with higher levels in the breeding season. The yearly pattern of GRD and catalase was close to that of melatonin, and GRD showed a significant seasonal variation (P < 0.01) with a higher activity during the breeding season. Linear regression analysis between the studied hormones and antioxidant enzymes showed a significant correlation between melatonin and testosterone, GRD, SOD and catalase.\nContext 3: Seminal plasma from nine Rasa Aragonesa rams were collected for one year, and their levels of melatonin, testosterone, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GRD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) were measured.\nContext 4: In contrast to the hypothesis, the ovulation did not affect the testosterone levels, and the resulting testosterone profile during the menstrual cycle was on the average flat. The specific main hypothesis, that male testosterone levels on the day of ovulation would be higher than day 4 of the cycle, was clearly contradicted by a type II error(\u03b2)-analysis (< 14.3% difference in normalized testosterone concentration; \u03b2 = 0.05).\nContext 5: Treatment with hMG increased plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels 1.4-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. The administration of hCG did not increase plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels any further; mean daily levels remained at 2.3 ng/mL and 0.64 ng/mL, respectively. Circadian changes in androstenedione levels were evident after hCG administration, with a peak at 2.0 ng/mL at 8:00 a.m. and a trough at 1.0 ng/mL at 4:00 p.m. The administration of hMG increased plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels 1.4-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. The administration of hCG did not increase plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels any further; mean daily levels remained at 2.3 ng/mL and 0.64 ng/mL, respectively.

In this study, we addressed this issue with cultured cardiac cells and serial echocardiography, creatine kinase (CK) measurements, and histologic examination of rats intramyocardially injected with an adenovirus that expresses both NIS and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Ad.EGFP.NIS) or a control virus (Ad.EGFP).\nContext 2: Cats were recruited for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening using echocardiography and genotyping. Circulating markers of collagen turnover (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CITP; type I collagen degradation] and N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [type III collagen synthesis]) and cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) were measured. Correlation between concentrations of collagen biomarkers and echocardiographic variables was analysed, and collagen biomarker concentrations were compared between MYBPC3 mutation positive and negative cats, without left ventricular hypertrophy.\nContext 3: Human carriers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated sarcomeric mutations have abnormal collagen metabolism before overt left ventricular hypertrophy is detectable. This study investigated whether differences in collagen biomarkers were present in blood samples of ragdoll cats positive for the MYBPC3:R820W mutation compared with negative controls.\nContext 4: One hundred and eight patients from unrelated families with borderline (n = 27) or definite (n = 81) diagnosis of ARVC were genetically tested for five desmosomal genes and LMNA. Sixty-one (56.5%) were positive for desmosomal gene mutations. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 12 protein-coding LMNA exons was performed and mutational screening performed by direct sequencing. Four patients (4%) without desmosomal gene mutations carried LMNA variants. Three had severe right ventricular involvement, and during follow-up three died (two suddenly and one from congestive heart failure); all three had conduction abnormalities on resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Myocardial tissue from two patients showed myocyte loss and fibro-fatty replacement. In one of these, immunohistochemical staining with antibody to plakoglobin showed reduced/absent desmosomal junctions.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a novel, non-invasive, non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging technique on the detection of myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a novel, non-invasive, non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging technique on the detection of myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a novel, non-invasive, non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging technique on", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Among the 48 patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer, recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival were significantly higher in the complete lymphadenectomy group (vs. the incomplete or no lymphadenectomy groups). However, there were no differences in recurrence-free and cancer-specific survivals among the 56 patients with lower ureteral cancer. In the patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer, multivariate analysis revealed that template-based lymphadenectomy was independently associated with a reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality.\nContext 2: Our previous nonrandomized prospective study showed that template-based lymphadenectomy improved survival among patients with renal pelvic cancer but not among patients with ureteral cancer. However, regional node sites vary according to the tumor's location in relation to the ureter. Therefore, this retrospective study examined the therapeutic role of lymphadenectomy for ureteral cancer according to tumor location.\nContext 3: The records of 3,973 patients treated with RC and bilateral lymphadenectomy for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) at nine centers worldwide were reviewed. Surgical specimens were evaluated by a genitourinary pathologist at each center. Uni- and multivariable Cox regression models addressed time to recurrence and cancer-specific mortality after RC.\nContext 4: Between January 1988 and September 2015, we performed nephroureterectomy for 154 patients with nonmetastatic urothelial carcinoma of the ureter at two Japanese institutions. The tumors' locations were classified as the lower ureter or the upper/middle ureter (before the cranial crossing of the common iliac artery). The appropriate regional nodes were identified based on our previous mapping study. Dissection was classified as complete lymphadenectomy (all regional sites were dissected), incomplete lymphadenectomy (not all sites were dissected), or no lymphadenectomy. We focused the analyses on patients with \u2265pT2 disease to clarify the effect of the lymphadenectomy.\nContext 5: Multiple bladder cancer studies report that the number of removed lymph nodes (lymph node count [LNC]) at radical cystectomy (RC) is positively associated with survival. Although these reports suggest that LNC can be used as a proxy for surgical quality, all studies used variable or inconsistent pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) templates. We therefore wished to establish whether LNC at RC influences survival if surgeons adhere to a standardized PLND template.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n    - What is the effect of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival in patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer?\n    - What is the effect of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival in patients with lower ureteral cancer?\n    - What is the effect of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival in patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer?\n    - What is the effect of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival in patients with lower ureteral cancer?\n    - What is the effect of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival in patients with upper/middle ureteral cancer?\n    - What is the effect of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival in patients with lower ureteral cancer?\n    - What", "Question: Does lung function distinguish preschool children with CF from healthy controls in a multi-center setting??\nYes, lung function distinguishes preschool children with CF from healthy controls in a multi-center setting.\nThe study was conducted in a multi-center setting, and the study subjects were preschool children with CF and healthy control subjects. The study subjects were assessed with spirometry and MBW with testing repeated during early school age (6-10 yr). The primary outcomes were FEV1 from spirometry and lung clearance index (LCI) from MBW.

Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) mediates endothelial function by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase activity. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, we investigated the relationship between serum levels of HDL and ADMA.\nContext 2: Blood samples from 612 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute MI <24 hours after symptom onset were taken on admission. Serum levels of ADMA, its stereoisomer, symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and L-arginine were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Patients with low HDL (<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women) were compared with patients with higher HDL. Most patients (59%) had low HDL levels. Median ADMA levels were markedly higher in the low HDL group (0.69 vs. 0.50 \u00b5mole/L, p<0.001). In contrast, SDMA and L-arginine levels were similar for the two groups (p\u200a=\u200a0.120 and p\u200a=\u200a0.064). Notably, ADMA, but not SDMA or L-arginine, was inversely correlated with HDL (r\u200a=\u200a-0.311, p<0.001). In stratified analysis, this relationship was only found for low HDL levels (r\u200a=\u200a-0.265, p<0.001), but not when HDL levels were higher (r\u200a=\u200a-0.077, p\u200a=\u200a0.225). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, ADMA level was strongly associated with low HDL levels (OR(95%CI):6.06(3.48-10.53), p<0.001), beyond traditional confounding factors.\nContext 3: We investigated the predictive value of monocyte count to HDL ratio (M/H ratio) for stent thrombosis (ST) in ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\nContext 4: This study examined alterations in the functions and proteome of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions (HDL2 and HDL3) isolated from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared with control subjects.\nContext 5: We investigated the relationship between serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\nContext 6: We investigated the relationship between serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\nContext 7: We investigated the relationship between serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)", "#1: No, there is no evidence that N-acetyl-L-cysteine or platelet activating factor inhibition is linked to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.\n#2: No, there is no evidence that N-acetyl-L-cysteine or platelet activating factor inhibition is linked to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.\n#3: No, there is no evidence that N-acetyl-L-cysteine or platelet activating factor inhibition is linked to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.\n#4: No,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Glycolipid \"rafts\" have been shown to play a role in apical membrane trafficking in the enterocyte. The present study characterized the membrane compartments of the enterocyte involved in transepithelial transport of small intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA).\nContext 2: IgA and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor/secretory component were present in a raft compartment. Raft association occurred posttranslationally within 30 minutes, preceding secretion into the culture medium. IgA labeling was seen primarily in enterocytes along the basolateral plasma membrane and over endosomes and small vesicles in the basolateral and apical regions of the cytoplasm. IgA and a brush border enzyme, aminopeptidase N, were colocalized in apical endosomes and small vesicles and were also frequently seen associated with the same vesicular profiles of glycolipid rafts. Colocalization of IgA and rab17, a small guanosine triphosphatase involved in transcytosis, was seen mainly along the basolateral plasma membrane and over basolateral endosomes and vesicles, but also in the apical region of the cytoplasm.\nContext 3: Mouse anti-islet IgG antibodies-either formed as a consequence of excessive Tfh activity, maternally transmitted, or passively transferred-caused a breakdown of tolerance in islet-reactive CD4(+) cells and fast progression to diabetes. Progression to diabetes was ameliorated in the absence of B cells or when the B cells could not secrete islet-specific IgG. Anti-islet antibodies increased the survival of proliferating islet-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Fc\u03b3R blockade delayed and reduced the incidence of autoimmune diabetes.\nContext 4: NG2 cells were recruited and clustered around the amyloid plaque in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, which is Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In vitro, NG2 cell line and primary NG2 cells engulfed \u03b2-amyloid peptides through the mechanisms of endocytosis in a time dependent manner. Endocytosis is divided into pinocytosis and phagocytosis. A\u03b2(42) internalization by NG2 cells was mediated by actin-dependent macropinocytosis. The presence of \u03b2-amyloid peptides stimulated the autophagic pathway in NG2 cells. Once inside the cells, the \u03b2-amyloid peptides were degraded by lysosomal proteases.

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance arteriography/venography was performed in all patients. All patients subsequently underwent surgical exploration. Surgical and radiological findings were then evaluated for concordance.\nContext 2: A total of 26 boys (29 impalpable testes) with a median age of 13 months were evaluated. A subset of 14 boys (14 impalpable testes) also underwent magnetic resonance arteriography/venography. Standard magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified 10 of 12 intra-abdominal testes, 4 of 6 intracanalicular testes, 4 of 10 testicular nubbins and 0 of 1 scrotal testis. Magnetic resonance arteriography/venography correctly identified 4 of 5 intra-abdominal testes, 2 of 3 intracanalicular testes, 2 of 5 testicular nubbins and 0 of 1 scrotal testis. The overall accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging alone and magnetic resonance arteriography/venography for identifying a viable testis or testicular nubbin was 62% and 57%, respectively. The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance arteriography/venography for identifying a viable testis was 74% and 67%, respectively.\nContext 3: Recent studies have shown that magnetic resonance arteriography/venography is a highly sensitive tool to identify impalpable testes in young boys. Due to this and the low risk of cancer in testicular nubbins observation has been proposed after the identification of nubbins by magnetic resonance arteriography/venography. We prospectively examined the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance arteriography/venography for identifying impalpable testes in a younger cohort of patients typically seen at a pediatric institution in the United States.\nContext 4: To determine if routine pre-procedure testing for outpatient cerebral angiography is necessary.\nContext 5: All sera tested were found negative in the 3 groups.

The evidence is critically analyzed, according to PRISMA guidelines.\nContext 2: The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health Research has recently invited proposals for the design of a multicomponent primary care package of behavioral interventions to reduce parental distress caused by excessive infant crying in the first 6 months of life. A systematic review was performed to determine whether behavioral interventions for sleep, when applied by parents to infants younger than 6 months, improve maternal and infant outcomes.\nContext 3: Cry-fuss, feeding, and sleep problems emerge out of multiple dynamically interacting and co-evolving variables in early life and are for this reason generically referred to as regulatory problems. Studies that link behavioral interventions for sleep in the first 6 months with positive effects on maternal and infant health demonstrate 3 methodological constraints. They fail to identify and control for feeding difficulties, fail to distinguish between the neurodevelopmentally different first and second halves of the first year of life, and apply reductive analyses to evaluations of complex interventions. Despite substantial investment in recent years in implementation and evaluation of behavioral interventions for infant sleep in the first 6 months, these strategies have not been shown to decrease infant crying, prevent sleep and behavioral problems in later childhood, or protect against postnatal depression. In addition, behavioral interventions for infant sleep, applied as a population strategy of prevention from the first weeks and months, risk unintended outcomes, including increased amounts of problem crying, premature cessation of breastfeeding, worsened maternal anxiety, and, if the infant is required to sleep either day or night in a room separate from the caregiver, an increased risk of SIDS.\nContext 4: A retrospective review of sleep studies performed over a 12-month period was undertaken at a New Zealand paediatric sleep medicine referral centre, to determine changes made to RS following sleep studies.\nContext 5: Sleep developmental measures at 3 months CA showed a clear developmental change compared with 36 weeks PCA. These include: increased amount of quiet sleep, reduced active sleep and indeterminate sleep, decreased arousal, and transitions during sleep. Longest sleep period at night showed a clear developmental effect (increased) when comparing nighttime sleep pattern of infants at 3 months with those at 36 weeks PCA. Sleep duration at 3 months was significantly longer than at 36 weeks PCA. Sleep efficiency at 3 months was significantly higher than at 36 weeks PCA.

Thirty-eight patients (1.19%) had pouch neoplasia, including 11 (0.36%) with adenocarcinoma of the pouch and/or the anal-transitional zone (ATZ), 1 (0.03%) with pouch lymphoma, 3 with squamous cell cancer of the ATZ, and 23 with dysplasia (0.72%). In the Cox model, the risk factor associated with pouch neoplasia was a preoperative diagnosis of UC-associated cancer or dysplasia, with adjusted hazard ratios of 13.43 (95% confidence interval: 3.96-45.53; P <.001) and 3.62 (95% confidence interval: 1.59-8.23; P =.002), respectively. Mucosectomy did not protect against pouch neoplasia.\nContext 4: There has been controversy over the significance of active inflammation of the terminal ileum (also known as backwash ileitis) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease of indeterminate type for diagnosis and pouch construction. We investigated the impact of backwash ileitis on pouch outcome after restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch anastomosis.\nContext 5: Data from patients with backwash ileitis (n = 132) were compared with those from 132 matched controls without ileal inflammation for age, sex, and type of proctocolectomies with ileal pouch construction (1- or 2-stage). We evaluated terminal ileal sections from original colectomies of 2213 patients with either UC or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease of indeterminate type, collected during a 21-year period, for extent of backwash ileitis and for the presence of active inflammation in the terminal ileum.\nContext 6: Backwash ileitis was present in 32% of patients with UC and 18% of patients with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease of indeterminate type. Backwash ileitis was associated with a higher risk of pouch neoplasia (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-4.0; P =.03).

Involvement of two crucial factors in phagocytosis, alpha(v)-integrins and Rho guanosine triphosphatase family member Rac1, was studied using small interfering RNA technology. Modified erythrocytes were administered in vivo into tumor-bearing mice to detect phagocytosis by endothelial cells.\nContext 2: Glutaraldehyde-treated (rigid) RGD-modified erythrocytes showed a strongly enhanced endothelial cell association compared to flexible RGD-modified erythrocytes. Knockdown by small interfering RNA lipoplexes of alpha(v)-integrins and Rac1 confirmed classical tethering and internalization of rigid RGD-erythrocytes. Upon in vivo administration, tumor endothelium showed pronounced erythrophagocytosis.\nContext 3: Angiogenic endothelial cells can function as phagocytes, and phagocytosis is initiated via the opsonin lactadherin. In this study, we examined the interaction between lactadherin-opsonized erythrocytes with reduced deformability and angiogenic endothelium, as loss of deformability is characteristic for suicidal and aged erythrocytes.\nContext 4: Acclimatization to reduced environmental oxygen includes erythropoietin-regulated increase in erythrocytes enhancing the blood's oxygen content. However, increased hematocrit levels result in elevated blood viscosity that might impair microcirculation and tissue oxygenation. To assess this oxygen supply to the skin, the authors used erythropoietin overexpressing transgenic mice (tg6) that develop excessive erythrocytosis in an oxygen-independent manner. These animals have been previously reported to elevate their blood viscosity 4-fold.\nContext 5: Erythropoietin (EPO) improves cardiac function and induces neovascularisation in post-myocardial infarction heart failure. The aim of this study was to analyse the association between the serum erythropoietin level and coronary collateral development in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic total occlusion.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below.\n\nThe authors used the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified erythrocyte model and investigated the deformability parameter by cross-linking erythrocyte membranes through treatment with glutaraldehyde.

CP-148,623 caused a marked inhibition (by 38%) of fractional cholesterol absorption (50% +/- 2% [baseline] to 31% +/- 1%) and a 71% increase in fecal neutral sterol excretion (481 +/- 39 mg/day [baseline] to 804 +/- 55 mg/day), compared with negligible changes in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 for both). Mean percent reductions from baseline in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were 11.6% with CP-148,623 (119 +/- 17 mg/dl to 104 +/- 13 mg/dl) versus a nonsignificant 1.8% reduction with placebo (change with CP-148,623 versus placebo, p < 0.0002).\nContext 3: In 76 subjects with and 94 subjects without MetS based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria, we determined plasma (apo)lipoproteins, pre-beta-HDL formation, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity, cholesterol esterification (EST), cholesteryl ester transfer (CET), adiponectin, and the ability of plasma from each subject to stimulate cholesterol efflux out of cultured fibroblasts obtained from a single donor.\nContext 4: At baseline, men with HPS possessed higher (P<0.01) mean serum cholesterol concentration, while those with LPS had higher (P<0.05) body mass index. Following PS intake, plasma sum of campesterol plus sitosterol concentrations were elevated from 34.6+/-4.2 to 46.2+/-3.3 micromol l(-1) (mean+/-SE) and 16.5+/-0.9 to 20.8+/-1.2 micromol l(-1) after PS intake in men with HPS and LPS, respectively. Changes in plasma PS concentrations, however, were not different between individuals with HPS and LPS. In contrast, PS concentrations were significantly lower in men with HPS than in those with LPS (P<0.05). In men with HPS, PS concentrations were significantly lower in those with HPS than in those with LPS (P<0.05). In men with HPS, PS concentrations were significantly lower in those with HPS than in those with LPS (P<0.05).

Nine vulvar and 1 vaginal SCC cell lines were HPV DNA negative and 1 vulvar cell line was HPV 16 positive. All 4 cervical SCC lines were HPV positive and possessed the wild-type p53. Three cell lines expressed HPV 16 and 1 HPV 68. Among 10 endometrial cancer cell lines, 2 cell lines with mutant p53 and 1 HPV 16 positive cell line were found. No correlation could be demonstrated between inactivation of the p53 gene and radiosensitivity in vitro; the cell lines were evaluated as one group or according to their anatomical origin or histology.\nContext 3: Comparison of the intrinsic radiosensitivity was performed with mean inactivation dose (D) determined with the 96-well plate clonogenic assay. p53 mutations were investigated with polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing, and the presence of HPV DNA was studied with PCR using HPV consensus primers.\nContext 4: The effect of adenoviral-mediated p53 transgene expression on the radiation response of two human prostate cancer cell lines, the p53(wild-type) LNCaP and p53(null) PC3 lines, was examined. The objective was to determine if this vector sensitizes cells to radiation independently of their p53 status.\nContext 5: Changes in wild-type p53 protein function occur in the majority of human tumors, and may alter genomic stability and the cellular response to ionizing radiation. Whether oncoproteins can render tumor cells both radioresistant and metastatic, may have implications for clinical strategies designed to improve local tumor control. In the studies reported here, we tested the hypothesis that acquired radioresistance correlates with metastatic potential within a large panel of transformed rat embryo cell (REF) lines following transfection with activated H-ras, mutant p53, and HPV16-E7 alleles.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\n    - The correlation between p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations and the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA with the in vitro radiosensitivity of gynecological malignancies was studied in 26 cell lines derived from gynecological cancers of 23 patients.\n    - p53 mutations were found in 6 of 10 vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines.

We previously demonstrated an association between a suppression in jejunal circular muscle activity and a massive extravasation of leukocytes into the muscularis after surgical manipulation of the small bowel. This study was pursued to establish a direct causal link between these events. Postoperative ileus is a major clinical problem, in which inflammation of the intestinal muscularis plays a key pathogenic event. Previously, administration of lipid-rich nutrition has been shown to reduce inflammation by activation of the autonomic nervous system via cholecystokinin-receptors. Postoperative ileus was induced", "Question: Is profermin efficacious in patients with active ulcerative colitis -- a randomized controlled trial??\nExplanation: Profermin is a fermented oat-based product that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 74 patients with mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomized to receive either Profermin or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was to assess whether addition of Profermin in UC could significantly reduce SCCAI in comparison with Fresubin. The study was stopped early because of futility. The study was not powered to detect a difference in efficacy between the two treatments.

The prevalence of obesity was greater among women with family history of diabetes, 39 (73.6%) vs. 27 (50.0%) of the control group, p = 0.02. Adiposity tended to be centrally distributed in 86 subjects, of whom 22 (25. 6%) males and 54 (62.8%) females were in the group with family history of diabetes and four (4.6%) males and six (7.0%) females in the control group, p <0.000. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a strong relationship between family history of type 2 diabetes with both abdominal obesity (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, CI 95% 1.9-10.1, p <0.05) and fasting hyperinsulinemia (OR 3.1, CI 95% 1. 4-11.2, p <0.05).\nContext 5: Subjects with a family history of ESRF (groups 1 and 2) had an increased mean albumin-creatinine ratio (1.25 vs. 1.00 mg/mmol, P = 0.01), but in subjects with a family history of diabetes (groups 1 and 3), the mean ratios were not significantly different from those without a family history of diabetes (1.06 vs. 1.17 mg/mmol; P = 0.2). In those with a family history of nephropathy, fasting blood glucose and systolic blood pressure were increased, while fasting insulin and 2 h insulin concentrations were lower. A family history of diabetes was associated with an increased fasting blood glucose and 2-h blood glucose. By multiple regression analysis, the family history of nephropathy was associated with a higher 2-h blood glucose (P = 0.02) and the family history of diabetes with a higher fasting blood glucose (P = 0.02).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of MODY in a group of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes and to compare the prevalence of MODY in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without a family history of diabetes.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of MODY in a group of 100 patients with type 2 diabetes and to compare the prevalence of MODY in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without a family", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To investigate whether screening for carriership of sickle-cell anaemia and thalassaemia is desirable in the Netherlands, given the prevalence of the diseases, the possibilities of a screening test and the knowledge of the population at risk.\nContext 2: Seventeen of the 22 patient referrals (77%) diagnosed with HH were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 3 (14%) were compound heterozygotes for mutations C282Y and H63D, and 2 patients (9%) did not exhibit either mutation. Screening of 458 control individuals from the general South African population demonstrated a carrier frequency of approximately 17% for the C282Y mutation among whites, implying that up to 1 out of every 115 South Africans of European descent may be homozygous for this founder-type mutation. Among 64 healthy blood donors of mixed ancestry, we detected 2 individuals heterozygous and 1 homozygous for the C282Y mutation.\nContext 3: 150 men were recruited from a genetic screening programme for hereditary hemocromatosis (HH) and were tested for type 2 diabetes, other components of the metabolic syndrome, beta cell function (BCF), insulin sensitivity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and iron overload.\nContext 4: In September 1992 Dutch paediatricians were treating 128 children with sickle-cell anaemia and 31 with thalassaemia major. Between October 1992 and December 1994, sickle-cell anaemia was diagnosed in 40 children and thalassaemia major in 14; of these, 16 and 4, respectively, had been born in the Netherlands. A protocol for the screening for carriership adjusted to the Dutch situation was drawn up in the past, with an estimate of the corresponding costs. Patients with sickle-cell anaemia or thalassaemia major, their families, care givers and persons without disease but originating from Surinam, the Netherlands Antilles, Turkey or Morocco were interviewed about their knowledge of these two diseases.\nContext 5: The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in South Africa in order to establish a reliable, cost-effective molecular diagnostic service for this potentially lethal disorder.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nThe context is:\nContext 1: To investigate whether screening for carriership of sickle-cell anaemia and thalassaemia is desirable in the Netherlands, given the prevalence of the diseases, the possibilities of a screening test and the knowledge of the population at risk.\nThe context is:\nContext 2: Seventeen of the 22 patient referrals (77%) diagnosed with HH were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 3 (14%) were compound heterozygotes for mutations C282Y and H63D, and 2 patients (9%) did not exhibit either mutation.

Despite close observation, some tumors progress to muscle invasion during this period. Historically, some believed that cystectomy applied in this setting could provide a better outcome in patients with \"early\" cT2 disease compared with those with de novo cT2 disease. We compared the pathologic and survival outcomes of patients with high-risk early-stage disease with those of patients with muscle-invasive tumors at presentation.\nContext 2: Our goal was to determine whether presenting", "No, N-Acetylcysteine does not improve glucose tolerance or \u03b2-cell function in type 2 diabetes.\nExplanation: N-Acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that is used to prevent contrast-induced renal dysfunction. It is a precursor of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). GSH is synthesized from cysteine and glycine. In type 2 diabetes, GSH is low, and NAC supplementation may increase GSH synthesis. However, NAC supplementation does not improve glucose tolerance or \u03b2-cell function in type 2 diabetes.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The effect of litter size and suckling intensity on the expression of KiSS-1 mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of rats were evaluated.\nContext 2: The expression of KiSS-1 mRNA in the ARC was decreased as the litter size and intensity of suckling stimulus were increased. The effect of suckling intensity on the expression of KiSS-1 mRNA was more pronounced than that of litter size.\nContext 3: We show here, using 1 million exon mouse arrays (Exon 1.0 Affymetrix) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) validation to analyse microdissected hypothalamic tissue from Gpr54 and Kiss1 knockout mice, the extent of transcriptional regulation in the hypothalamus. The sensitivity to detect important transcript differences in microdissected RNA was confirmed by the observation of counter-regulation of Kiss1 expression in Gpr54 knockouts and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Since Gpr54 and Kiss1 knockout animals are effectively pre-pubertal with low testosterone (T) levels, we also determined which of the validated transcripts were T-responsive and which varied according to genotype alone. We observed four types of transcriptional regulation (i) genotype only dependent regulation, (ii) T only dependent regulation, (iii) genotype and T-dependent regulation with interaction between these variables, (iv) genotype and T-dependent regulation with no interaction between these variables. The results implicate for the first time several transcription factors (e.g. Npas4, Esr2), proteases (Klk1b22), and the orphan 10-transmembrane transporter TMEM144 in the biology of GPR54/kisspeptin function in the hypothalamus. We show for the neuronal activity regulated transcription factor NPAS4, that distinct protein over-expression is seen in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in Gpr54 knockout mice. This links for the first time the hypothalamic-gonadal axis with this important regulator of inhibitory synapse formation. Similarly we confirm TMEM144 up-regulation in the hypothalamus by RNA in situ hybridization and western blot.\nContext 4: Thirty two pregnant and four non-lactating ovariectomized (as control group) rats were used in this experiment. Lactating rats were allotted to eight equal groups. In three groups, litter size was adjusted to 5, 10, or 15 pups upon parturition. In the remaining groups, litter size was maintained at 10 pups. The remaining groups were allotted to two equal groups. In one group, litter size was adjusted to 5 pups upon parturition. In the other group, litter size was maintained at 10 pups. The remaining groups were allotted to two equal groups. In one group, litter size was adjusted to 5 pups upon parturition. In the other group, litter size was maintained at 10 pups.

It has been reported to have similar pharmacological activity to curcumin. The proteases that participate in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation are involved in cancer cell metastasis. The present study investigates the effect of an ultimate metabolite of curcumin, THC, on the invasion and motility of highly-metastatic HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells.\nContext 2: Treatment with THC reduced HT1080 cell invasion and migration in a dose-dependent manner. THC also decreased the cell adhesion to Matrigel and laminin-coated plates. Analysis by zymography demonstrated that treatment with THC reduced the levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA. THC also inhibited the levels of MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 proteins detected by Western blot analysis.\nContext 3: The effect of THC on HT1080 cell invasion and migration was determined using Boyden chamber assay. Cell-adhesion assay was used for examining the binding of cells to ECM molecules. Zymography assay was used to analyze the effect of THC on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion from HT1080 cells. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) proteins levels were analyzed by Western blotting.\nContext 4: Using transwell assays, migration of different breast cancer cell lines was assessed. A direct correlation was found between cell migration and baseline LAMP3 expression. Furthermore, moderate hypoxia (1% O2) was found to be optimal in stimulating migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of PERK, ATF4 and LAMP3 reduced migration of cells under these conditions.

Our hypothesis was that acute sleep deprivation would not lead to an increase in operative times or complications.\n\n## Context 2\n\nA retrospective review of all cases performed by thoracic surgical residents at the University of Virginia from January 1994 to", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Reports suggested an increase in enterocutaneous fistulae with topical negative pressure (TNP) use in the open abdomen. The purpose of this study was to establish if our experience raises similar concerns.\nContext 2: All insertion attempts, without previous esophageal dilation, were successful. The overall mortality was 7.4%. The cuffed funnel has provided hermetic water-tight exclusion of the fistula in all instances. Intraabdominal septic complications, reflux, or tube displacement have never occurred after use of this intubation technique.\nContext 3: Postoperatively, no differences were observed in the amount of transfusion (0.15 +/- 0.66 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.63 PRCU; P = 0.7234) or in the patients that required transfusion (18% vs. 12%; P = 0.2), respectively, for the fibrin glue or control group. There were no differences in overall drainage volumes (1180 +/- 2528 vs. 960 +/- 1253 mL) or in days of postoperative drainage (7.9 +/- 5 vs. 7.1 +/- 4.7). Incidence of biliary fistula was similar in the fibrin glue and control groups, (10% vs. 11%). There were no differences regarding postoperative morbidity between groups (23% vs. 23%; P = 1).\nContext 4: One hundred ninety-six intestinal procedures were performed. One hundred twenty-seven (64.8%) of these were performed among patients who received perioperative immunomodulation. Forty-six (23.5%) procedures were in patients who received >1 immunomodulating medication perioperatively. Complications occurred in 45 (23.0%) cases. There were 20 (10.2%) anastomotic complications, including 8 (4.1%) intra-abdominal abscesses, 8 (4.1%) anastomotic leaks, and 4 (2%) enterocutaneous fistulas. Preoperative treatment with steroids (P=0.21), 6-MP (P=0.10), and anti-tumor necrosis factor biologics (P=1.0) was not associated with increased postoperative anastomotic complications. Combination immunosuppressive therapy also did not increase morbidity (P=0.39).\nContext 5: The incidence of anastomotic leak was 4.1% (8/196) in the immunosuppressed group and 2.2% (4/186) in the immunosuppressed group (P=0.39). The incidence of enterocutaneous fistula was 10.2% (20/196) in the immunosuppressed group and 4.1% (8/186) in the immunosuppressed group (P=0.21). The incidence of anastomotic leak was 4.1% (8/196) in the immunosuppressed group and 2.2% (4/186) in the immunosuppressed group (", "Question: Is it `` Just Circumcision ''??\nExplanation: The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate the boys who were admitted to a hospital for circumcision and the outcome of the procedure.\nThe study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in India. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. The study was conducted from January 2009 to December 2015. The boys who were brought to outpatient clinics for circumcision between 2009-2015, were retrospectively evaluated.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We have shown previously that protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are required for the bFGF-stimulated mitogenic process in bovine cSMC. In this study, we determined the PKC isoform(s) involved and investigated their functional role in the bFGF-stimulated signaling and cell cycle progression in human and bovine cSMC.\nContext 2: Cell viability and proliferation assays were employed using an EZ-Cytox Cell Viability Assay Kit. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration was measured by scratch wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. The expression levels of the phosphorylated signaling proteins relevant to proliferation, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were determined by western blot analysis. Chromatogram and mass analysis were employed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system. Cell prolife ration and migration were also explored using the PDGF-BB-induced aortic sprout assay.\nContext 3: Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration is critical to the development of atherosclerosis and neointimal hyperplasia. Hemodynamic forces such as shear stress and cyclic strain stimulate endothelial cell signal-transduction pathways, resulting in the secretion of several factors, including SMC chemoattractants such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We hypothesized that mechanical forces stimulate endothelial cells to secrete SMC chemoattractants to induce migration via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.\nContext 4: Downregulation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited bFGF-induced DNA synthesis, the activation of MAPK, and the expression of c-myc, demonstrating the involvement of PMA-sensitive PKC isoforms in growth factor-induced proliferation and the MAPK pathway. The PMA-sensitive classical PKC isoforms alpha, beta, gamma and novel PKC isoforms delta and epsilon were found in human cSMC. Whereas blocking of the classical PKC isoforms with chelerythrine chloride and bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) inhibited bFGF-induced DNA synthesis, the novel PKC isoforms were not affected. In contrast, the classical PKC isoforms were inhibited by BIM, but the novel PKC isoforms were not. The classical PKC isoforms were also inhibited by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but the novel PKC isoforms were not. The classical PKC isoforms were inhibited by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but the novel PKC isoforms were not.

The Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway is the major mechanism associated with radioresistance. To evaluate the potential significance on the outcome of radiotherapy in OSCC of the Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway with respect to methylation of negative regulators, we examined the methylation status of genes known to be involved in Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway and aberrantly methylated in human cancers together with the mutation status of K-ras/H-ras.\nContext 2: The frequencies of K-ras/H-ras mutation and promoter methylation of the RASSF1A, RASSF2A, PTEN, and HIN-1 genes were 6.6%, 22.4%, 27.8%, 1.2%, and 7.3%, respectively. A combination of RASSF1A and RASSF2A methylation was found to be significantly associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS). Furthermore, a gene dosage effect of the activated Ras/PI3K/AKT signal on DFS was observed in patients treated with radiotherapy after surgery but not in patients treated with surgery alone. The Ras/PI3K/AKT pathway was activated in 140 primary OSCCs among 286 patients treated with radiotherapy after surgery and methylation of RASSF1A/RASSF2A (75.7%) was the most common mechanism.\nContext 3: Although no histopathological abnormalities were induced in the epithelium after 4 weeks of carcinogen exposure, Ki-67 was overexpresssed in the 'normal' oral epithelium. In pre-neoplastic lesions at 12 weeks following carcinogen exposure, the levels of Ki-67 were increased (P < 0.05) when compared to negative control. Ki-67, alpha-SMA and VEGF were also overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas induced after 20 weeks of treatment with 4NQO. No significant statistical differences (P > 0.05) were found in H-ras protein expression for all experimental periods evaluated that corresponded to normal oral mucosa, hyperplasia, dysplasia and squamous cell carcinomas. In the same way, no mutations in H-ras or K-ras genes were found.\nContext 4: Methylation of RUNX3 promoter was significantly higher in GC than normal oral mucosa (P < 0.05).

We assessed the association between basal (defined as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)>2) and post-load insulin resistance (as oral glucose insulin sensitivity index<9.8 mg/kg/min) with the rapid and sustained virological responses in chronic hepatitis C.\nContext 2: To investigate the independent association between the homeostasis model assessment of the insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score and rapid virological response (RVR) and sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\nContext 3: Baseline homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a marker for insulin resistance, has been associated with poor virologic response to peginterferon alpha/ribavirin (PR) in chronic hepatitis C. We evaluated the association between baseline HOMA-IR and pretreatment factors on sustained virologic response (SVR) to telaprevir (TVR) in genotype 1 patients with hepatitis C and prior peginterferon/ribavirin (PR) treatment failure. Patients were randomized to 12 weeks of TVR (750 mg q8h) plus peginterferon (180 \u03bcg/week) and ribavirin (1,000-1,200 mg/day) (with or without a 4-week lead-in) followed by PR, or PR alone (PR48), for 48 weeks. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses explored the prognostic significance of baseline HOMA-IR alone and adjusted for other pretreatment factors and SVR. The TVR arms were pooled for the purposes of this analysis. In all, 662 patients were randomized; 578 had baseline HOMA-IR and other prognostic data and were included in this analysis. Median baseline HOMA-IR was 2.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.7-4.3); 207 (36%), 206 (36%), and 165 (29%) patients had baseline HOMA-IR <2, 2 to <4, and \u2265 4, respectively. Male gender, higher body mass index, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, maximum alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ratio, and baseline HOMA-IR were associated with SVR. In the TVR arm, baseline HOMA-IR was not associated with SVR (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-1.5, P = 0.5).

New Zealand White rabbits (n = 36) were anesthetized with halothane and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocarbia. Microdialysis catheters were inserted bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 2 microL/min. Animals were randomly assigned to control, hypothermia (30 degrees C), or riluzole (2 or 8 mg/kg; R2 and R8) groups. Two episodes of transient global cerebral ischemia (each lasting 10 min) were produced by inflating the pneumatic tourniquet combined with induced hypotension. Dialysate was collected throughout the periischemic period, and glutamate concentrations were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak levels were compared by using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Glutamate concentrations significantly increased by twofold to fourfold during the second ischemic period for the control, R2, and R8 groups. Glutamate concentrations in the hypothermic group were significantly lower than those in the other three groups and remained at baseline levels during the entire experiment. This study demonstrates that the sodium channel blocker riluzole does not inhibit ischemia-induced glutamate accumulation. The previously reported neuroprotective ability of riluzole may be caused by mechanisms other than the presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release during ischemia.\nContext 2: General anesthetics reduce neuron loss following focal cerebral ischemia in rodents. The relative efficacy of this action among different anesthetics clinically used for neuroprotection is uncertain. In addition, it remains unclear how anesthetics compare to neuroprotection afforded by mild hypothermia. This study was performed to evaluate the comparative effects of isoflurane, sodium pentothal, and mild hypothermia in a hippocampal slice model of cerebral ischemia and to determine if the mechanism of neuroprotection of isoflurane involves inhibition of glutamate excitotoxicity.\nContext 3: We used a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model in cultures of rat or mouse hippocampal slices and a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion model in vivo. The effect of a COX-2 inhibitor on neuronal damage in mPGES-1 knockout (KO) mice was also examined. The results showed that the COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, significantly reduced the excitotoxicity of glutamate in both mouse and rat hippocampal slices. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion model, NS-398 significantly reduced neuronal damage in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the KO mice. In addition, NS-398 significantly reduced the expression of COX-2 in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the KO mice. These results suggest that the COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, may be a potential neuroprotective agent in the treatment of stroke.\nContext 4: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 on the expression of CO", "No, the prehospital simplified motor score is not as accurate as the prehospital Glasgow coma scale.

It is particularly common in the context of cardiovascular disease, but it is unclear whether prescribing of multiple cardiovascular medicines, which may be entirely appropriate and consistent with clinical guidance, is associated with adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between number of prescribed cardiovascular medicines and unplanned non-cardiovascular hospital admissions.\nContext 2: A retrospective cohort analysis of 180,815 adult patients was conducted using Scottish primary care data linked to hospital discharge data. Patients were followed up for one year for the outcome of unplanned non-cardiovascular hospital admission. The association between number of prescribed cardiovascular medicines and hospitalisation was modelled using logistic regression, adjusting for key confounding factors including cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular morbidity and non-cardiovascular prescribing.\nContext 3: To investigate the association between generic substitutions and medication adherence in elderly patients with prescribed polypharmacy.\nContext 4: 25.4% patients were prescribed \u22651 cardiovascular medicine, and 5.7% were prescribed \u22655. At least one unplanned non-cardiovascular admission was experienced by 4.2% of patients. Admissions were more common in patients receiving multiple cardiovascular medicines (6.4% of patients prescribed 5 or 6 cardiovascular medicines) compared with those prescribed none (3.5%). However, after adjusting for key confounders, cardiovascular prescribing was associated with fewer non-cardiovascular admissions (OR 0.66 for 5 or 6 vs. no cardiovascular medicines, 95% CI 0.57-0.75).\nContext 5: We assessed the polymorphisms VNTR (A, B, C, D) of glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha, 807C/T of GP Ia/IIa, and Pl(A1/A2) of GP IIb/IIIa, and the 5-year incidence of major recurrent events in 82 stroke patients with no major sources of cardioembolism (mean age 70, SD 9.0 years; female gender 23%). Using a structured interview, all participants confirmed good compliance with aspirin (100-300 mg/day) for secondary prevention.

However, the diagnosis of PH is based on the measurement of mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and the ratio of the pulmonary artery to aorta diameter (PA/Ao ratio). The 2011 guidelines for the diagnosis of IPF recommend that the MPAP be measured in patients with IPF using right-heart catheterization. However, the guidelines do not provide a scoring system for the diagnosis of PH based on the HRCT findings.

Male ob/ob mice demonstrated slightly higher avoidance of bitter taste, and females of the both mutant strains showed a reduced preference for saccharin solutions. Administration of leptin (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally, daily for 8 days) altered body weight but failed to increase the preference for ethanol in ob/ob mice; i.e., we could not correct the effects of leptin deficiency on alcohol consumption by the injection of leptin. Also, there were no differences between the effects of leptin (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally, daily for 8 days) and saline injections on alcohol consumption in C57BL/6 mice.\nContext 2: The neuropeptide leptin links adipose stores with hypothalamic centers and serves as an endocrine signal involved in the regulation of appetite (and possibly in the endorphinergic modulation of the drug reward system). Increased plasma leptin has been observed at the onset of alcohol withdrawal in humans, and ethanol consumption after withdrawal was increased by injection of leptin in mice. We addressed the role of leptin in alcohol-related behaviors by studying ethanol consumption in two strains of spontaneously mutant mice that lack leptin (ob/ob) or the leptin receptor (db/db).\nContext 3: Two strains of mutant leptin-deficient (ob/ob) or leptin-resistant (db/db) mice were tested in a two-bottle-choice paradigm and were compared with wild-type (C57BL/6 inbred strain) mice. The effects of leptin injection on voluntary ethanol intake have been investigated in ob/ob and C57BL/6 mice.\nContext 4: The neuropeptides leptin and ghrelin are involved in the appetite regulating network consisting of distinct orexigenic (ghrelin) and anorexigenic (leptin) circuitries. Recently, it has been shown that elevated leptin levels are associated with alcohol craving in patients suffering from alcoholism. Therefore, the aim of the present pilot study was to determine whether the gut-derived peptide ghrelin which increases hunger and food intake is altered and associated with alcohol craving in alcoholic patients\nContext 5: The behavioral effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) attributed to its actions in the hypothalamus are complex and include effects on feeding, sedation, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

All formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor samples were reviewed and immunohistochemically stained for ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 antigen, epidermal growth factor receptor, cytokeratin 5/6, p53, vimentin, CD117, and p63 using tissue microarrays blocks. Triple-negative breast carcinomas corresponded to 34.6% (74/213) of the carcinomas from the younger patients and 16.2% (19/117) of the carcinomas from the older patients (p = 0.002). No significant differences in the frequency of the basal phenotype were observed in the two patient groups based on CK5/6 and/or epidermal growth factor receptor expression (74.3% vs. 68.4%). However, triple-negative breast carcinomas in the older patients presented a higher frequency of CK5/6 expression compared to those of younger patients (42.1% vs. 9.6%; p = 0.005), whereas triple-negative breast carcinomas of younger patients had a higher expression level of epidermal growth factor receptor (71.6% vs. 47.3%).\nContext 3: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of expression of both estrogen and progesterone receptor as well as lack of overexpression or amplification of HER2. Despite an increased probability of response to chemotherapy, many patients resistant to current chemotherapy regimens suffer from a worse prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. However, molecular determinants of response to chemotherapy specific to TNBC remain largely unknown. Thus, there is a high demand for biomarkers potentially stratifying triple negative breast cancer patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapies or alternative therapies.\nContext 4: We identified 818 clinically node-negative breast cancer patients at our cancer center who had undergone surgery as their first therapeutic modality for invasive breast cancer from September 2003 to December 2006. Baseline tumor size was determined by mammography and sonography. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of HER2 amplification. The HER2 status was determined by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of HER2 amplification. The patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of HER2 amplification. The patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of HER2 amplification. The patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of HER2 amplification. The patients were then stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of HER2 amplification. The patients were then stratified", "Contexts:\nContext 1: ECM-related glycoproteins were identified in left and right atrial appendages from the same patients. Several known glycosylation sites were confirmed. In addition, putative and novel glycosylation sites were detected. On enrichment for glycoproteins, peptides of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin were identified consistently in the flowthrough. Of all ECM proteins identified, decorin was found to be the most fragmented. Within its protein core, 18 different cleavage sites were identified. In contrast, less cleavage was observed for biglycan, the most closely related proteoglycan. Decorin processing differed between human ventricles and atria and was altered in disease. The C-terminus of decorin, important for the interaction with connective tissue growth factor, was detected predominantly in ventricles in comparison with atria. In contrast, atrial appendages from patients in persistent atrial fibrillation had greater levels of full-length decorin but also harbored a cleavage site that was not found in atrial appendages from patients in sinus rhythm. This cleavage site preceded the N-terminal domain of decorin that controls muscle growth by altering the binding capacity for myostatin. Myostatin expression was decreased in atrial appendages of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and hearts of decorin null mice. A synthetic peptide corresponding to this decorin region dose-dependently inhibited the response to myostatin in cardiomyocytes and in perfused mouse hearts.\nContext 2: Survival rates were 81.8% in Group I, 50.0% in Group II and 62.5% in Group III. The number of GFP-BMC in Group I (15.4 +/- 7.4 per high-power field) was highest (p < 0.05). In all groups, cardiac troponin I-positive cells derived from GFP-BMC were observed in the hearts. GFP-BMC in hearts stained positively against cardiac troponin I (4.3 +/- 2.5%), myosin heavy chain (5.0 +/- 4.3%), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; 3.9 +/- 2.4%) and connexin 43 (11.9 +/- 7.3%) in Group I. Myofibrils, mitochondria and fundamental architecture were almost all preserved in Group I, whereas hearts were severely damaged in Groups II and III.\nContext 3: The results of this study suggest that the expression of the TGF-\u03b21 receptor (T\u03b2RII) is upregulated in the atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation. The T\u03b2RII expression was significantly higher in the atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation than in the atrial myocardium of patients with sinus rhythm. The T\u03b2RII expression was significantly higher in the atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation than in the atrial myocardium of patients with sinus rhythm. The T\u03b2RII expression was significantly higher in the atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation than in the atrial myocardium of patients with sinus rhythm.

This association is independent of age, sex, and other comorbidities. The association is also independent of lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity, and alcohol use. The association is also independent of the presence of depression severity and antidepressant drug use. The results suggest that C-reactive protein may be a marker of inflammation in adolescents with depressive symptoms.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Recent studies have shown that brain tumor cells, unlike normal brain cells, are largely dependent upon glucose for energy and are not able to use ketone bodies as a primary energy source. These findings are thought to be because of decreased expression of succinyl-coenzyme A:3-oxoacid coenzyme A transferase (SCOT), a key enzyme involved in ketone body metabolism. Because of their neural crest origin, we hypothesized that neuroblastoma cells would also be unable to use ketone bodies as a primary energy source.\nContext 2: Neuroblastoma cell viability was significantly decreased in the acetoacetate and hydroxybutyrate media by 52% and 61%, respectively, compared with control media. In addition, neuroblastoma cells showed significantly more apoptosis in the ketone media. Viability and apoptosis in the normal fibroblasts were not affected by the culture media. The expression of SCOT protein was significantly less in human neuroblastoma cells compared with the control fibroblasts.\nContext 3: We determined if the potentially otoprotective agent sodium thiosulfate (STS) could be given 6 h after cisplatin without diminishing the antineuroblastoma activity of cisplatin in human neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro (including cisplatin-resistant cell lines) and in neuroblastoma xenografts in vivo.\nContext 4: We determined the antineuroblastoma activity of cisplatin with or without the addition of STS at 0 or 6 h after cisplatin in six neuroblastoma cell lines, both in standard cell culture conditions (20% O(2)) and in physiologic hypoxia (2% O(2)). Drug cytotoxicity was measured using the DIMSCAN fluorescence/digital imaging microscopy assay. In vivo studies of cisplatin combined with STS used a human neuroblastoma subcutaneous xenograft model (SMS-SAN) in athymic nu/nu mice.\nContext 5: NCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. While highly expressed on neuroblastoma cells, the relative contribution of the three major NCAM isoforms (120, 140, and 180 kDa) to neuroblastoma biology has not been investigated.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the literature.", "Question: Does proDisc cervical arthroplasty alter facet joint contact pressure during lateral bending or axial torsion??\nYes, the implantation of a proDisc-C at C5-C6 alters the facet joint contact pressure during lateral bending and axial torsion.

There is a strong social gradient in self-rated health. An investigation was carried to determine whether self-rated health can explain the well-known socioeconomic gradient in mortality.\nContext 1: Self-rated current health is an independent, robust predictor of subsequent mortality in older adults. Investigators hypothesize that individuals likely take into account their future health when reporting their current health", "Question: Are esophageal function tests helpful in symptoms suspicious of extraesophageal reflux - a prospective study in 74 patients??\nContext 1: In a prospective study we evaluated 60 patients with SSEER by esophageal function tests (esophageal manometry, combined 24\u200ah pH - metry - impedance and oropharyngeal pH measurement, Dx - pH measurement) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patients were stratified into 2 groups according to their accompanying reflux symptoms.

Fasting plasma concentrations of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and leptin were measured on days 1 and 57. Urinary excretion of genistein, glycitein, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma), and equol was measured on days 4 and 61 following a 4-day soy challenge.\nContext 2: To confirm the results of an earlier study showing premenopausal equol excretors to have hormone profiles associated with reduced breast cancer risk, and to investigate whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone concentrations can be influenced by consumption of probiotics.\nContext 3: During menstrual cycle 1, equol excretors and non-excretors were not significantly different with respect to subject characteristics, diet, or hormone concentrations. Significant inverse correlations were found between E(2) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.02), SHBG and BMI (P=0.01), DHEA-S and dietary fiber (P=0.04), and A and protein:carbohydrate ratio (P=0.02). Probiotic consumption failed to significantly alter equol excretor status or hormone concentrations during menstrual cycle 3, although there were trends towards decreased concentrations of T (P=0.14) and SHBG (P=0.10) in the probiotic group.\nContext 4: The aim of this study was to determine whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone and leptin concentrations can be influenced by consumption of a probiotic supplement. A secondary focus was to investigate whether male equol excretors have a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk.\nContext 5: Probiotic consumption did not significantly alter equol excretor status, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. At baseline, there were no differences in plasma hormone concentrations between equol excretors and nonexcretors; however, the low number of equol excretors included in this study limits the strength of this finding.\n\nBased on the results of this study, it is not clear whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone concentrations can be influenced by consumption of probiotics. The study was not powered to detect differences in hormone concentrations between equol excretors and non-excretors, and the small number of equol excretors included in this study limits the strength of this finding. The study was not powered to detect differences in hormone concentrations between equol excretors and non-excretors, and the small number of equol excretors included in this study limits the strength of this finding.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Varying degrees of cytoplasmic FHL2 expression by neoplastic epithelial cells were detectable in all cases. Higher FHL2 expression in the epithelial compartment was an independent adverse prognostic factor. Multivariate Cox analysis shows that expression in the tumour invasion front (P<0.001) as well as in the centre of the tumour (P<0.001) was associated with metachronous metastases independently of the clinicopathological variables; expression in the tumour invasion front was also associated with overall survival independently of the clinicopathological variables (P<0.01).\nContext 2: Confocal microscopy detected nuclear expression of FHL2 in colon cancer cells and absence of nuclear FHL2 signal in normal colon enterocytes. In colon cancer, nuclear FHL2 expression was predominantly observed in low-differentiated, often mucinous tumor areas. 42.55% of sporadic and 54.76% of HNPCC-associated CRC showed enhanced (Remmele score 6-12) nuclear FHL2 expression in the carcinoma cells of the tumoral advancing edge. Enhanced nuclear FHL2 expression was significantly linked to lymphatic metastasis in sporadic CRC (p=0.0197) and almost reached significance in HNPCC-associated CRC (p=0.0545). In contrast, nuclear FHL2 expression was neither associated with hematogenic metastasis in sporadic (p=0.7087) nor in HNPCC-associated colorectal cancer (p=0.3007).\nContext 3: Four and a half LIM domain protein-2 (FHL2) is part of the focal adhesion structures modulating cell motility. FHL2 may translocate into the nucleus serving as a transcriptional cofactor binding several transcription factors. Overexpression of FHL2 has been linked to cancer progression in various neoplasias. The aim of the present study was to determine, whether FHL2's function as nuclear cofactor plays a prognostic role in invading tumor cells of sporadic and HNPCC-associated colorectal cancer (CRC).\nContext 4: Four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) is a component of the focal adhesion structures and has been suggested to have a role in cancer progression. It has been shown to be overexpressed in the colorectal cancer (CRC).\nContext 5: Immunohistochemical staining intensity of FHL2 in the tumour invasion front was significantly higher in HNPCC-associated CRC than in sporadic CRC (p=0.001). In HNPCC-associated CRC, FHL2 expression in the tumour invasion front was associated with lymphatic metastasis (p=0.001) and overall survival (p=0.001). In sporadic CRC, FHL2 expression in the tumour invasion front was associated with lymphatic metastasis (p=0.001) and overall survival (p=0.001).

It is associated with a number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and is a risk factor for preterm birth. The relationship between bacterial vaginosis and male circumcision status is unknown. We hypothesized that women with uncircumcised partners are at increased risk for bacterial vaginosis. We examined the effect of male circumcision on the acquisition of 3 nonulcerative STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis) and preterm birth.\nWe conducted a retrospective audit of a", "Yes, immune function abnormalities in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine expression differentiate stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides.\nExplanation: The study was designed to determine the expression of cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/mycosis fungoides (CTCL/MF) and healthy controls.

It is possible that their epilepsy might not be truly \"drug-resistant\". We audited the patients with \"uncontrolled epilepsy\" using the recent ILAE definition of drug-resistant epilepsy.\nContext 2: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy at Glasgow and patients with chronic epilepsy treated in Hong Kong were independently assessed at their last clinic visit. If the patient was not seizure-free, the epilepsy was considered \"uncontrolled\". In this latter situation, if the patient had adequate trials of two or more tolerated, appropriately chosen, and appropriately used AED schedules, the epilepsy was classified as \"drug-resistant\" in accordance with the ILAE definition. If not, the outcome was classified as \"undefined\", and the reason(s) for this was documented.\nContext 3: Recent reports have documented the appearance of Brugada-type ST elevation in cases of overdose of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However, little is known about changes on electrocardiographs (ECGs) during AED use at therapeutic doses. AEDs may cause Brugada-type ST elevation or J-wave-like intraventricular conduction delays through an ion channel-blocking effect. In the present study, we sought to elucidate ECG abnormalities in patients on AED therapy.\nContext 4: Of the 120 patients, 15 (12.5%) exhibited Brugada-type ST elevation and 35 (29.2%) showed a J-wave-like ECG abnormality. Polytherapy with sodium channel-blocking AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine) was more frequently observed in patients with Brugada-type ST elevation (p=0.048). However, the serum concentrations of these medicines did not differ between patients with and without ECG abnormalities (carbamazepine: 7.9\u00b14.1 vs. 7.2\u00b15.9\u03bcg/dL; phenytoin: 12.7\u00b14.1 vs. 15.5\u00b19.5\u03bcg/dL, NS).\nContext 5: Thirty-one (22%) out of 139 patients were treated with anti-epileptic drugs (phenytoin, levetiracetam, valproate, clonazepam, propofol, midazolam), of whom 24 had status epilepticus. The median serum concentrations of phenytoin, levetiracetam, valproate, and clonazepam were 7.9\u00b14.1, 7.2\u00b15.9, 12.7\u00b14.1, and 15.5\u00b19.5\u03bcg/dL, respectively.

Aminoacid glutamine is known for its' proteoanabolic effect and as an energy source for enterocytes and immune system. Nutritional parameters have been studied in a controlled, randomised, double-blinded trial of parenteral glutamine supplementation of autologous stem cell transplant patients.\nContext 2: Forty consecutive patients with haematological and solid cancer and multiple sclerosis were treated from 1999 to 2001 by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients were randomly assigned either for parenteral administration of 30 g of alanyl-glutamine dipeptide (Dipeptiven, Fresenius-Kabi) or isonitrogenous glutamine-free amino acid solution from day +1 to day +14 or to discharge from hospital. Patients were closely monitored from admission to day +100. Nutritional parameters included: oral dietary intake, body weight, body composition, energy expenditure, concentration of serum proteins and nitrogen balance. Parenteral nutrition in dose of 26.5 kcal/kg and 1 g of aminoacid/kg was given to patients who did not reach adequate oral intake for 5 days and withheld after three consecutive days of adequate intake.\nContext 3: Glutamine is one of the most abundant amino acids in both plasma and human milk, yet it is not included in standard intravenous amino acid solutions. Previous studies have suggested that parenteral nutrition (PN) supplemented with glutamine may reduce sepsis and mortality in critically ill adults. Whether glutamine supplementation would provide a similar benefit to extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants is not known.\nContext 4: Children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) for malignant hematological diseases were randomly assigned to standard total parenteral nutrition (S-TPN) or glutamine-enriched (GE)-TPN solution consisting of 0.4 g/kg/day of l-alanine-glutamine dipeptide. This treatment started on the day of HSCT and ended when the patients could orally cover more than 50% of their daily energy requirements. The severity and the rate of post-HSCT mucositis were based on World Health Organization criteria. All the analyses were conducted on intention-to-treat principle.\nContext 5: Nutritional assessment on admission differed according to the method used but no parameter of nutrition was significantly different between the two groups. The only significant difference was the body weight gain, which was significantly higher in the glutamine group. The body composition was similar in both groups. The energy expenditure was significantly higher in the glutamine group. The concentration of serum proteins was similar in both groups. The nitrogen balance was significantly higher in the glutamine group. The oral dietary intake was similar in both groups. The oral dietary intake was significantly higher in the glutamine group.

Consecutive patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction formed the case group; the control group consisted of patients with bile duct stone. The case group was further subclassified into group A, patients who underwent sphincter of Oddi manometry followed by immediate ERCP, and group B, patients who had ERCP without manometry. The rate of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis was compared between case and control groups.\nContext 2: Sphincter of Oddi manometry is helpful in selecting patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction who will respond to sphincterotomy. However, studies have shown that sphincter of Oddi manometry is associated with a high risk of post-procedure pancreatitis. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of sphincter of Oddi manometry in patients with sphincter of 2Oddi dysfunction. The secondary objective was to determine the risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis in patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\nContext 3: Consecutive patients who underwent sphincter of Oddi manometry to investigate unexplained upper abdominal pain (n = 104) were assessed for evidence of chronic pancreatitis by pancreatic ductography, endoscopic ultrasound, and pancreatic fluid bicarbonate concentration.\nContext 4: Twenty-seven percent of patients in the case group with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction developed acute pancreatitis compared with 3.2% of patients in the control group with bile duct stone (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in the rate of acute pancreatitis in patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction who underwent sphincter of Oddi manometry and ERCP compared with patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction who had ERCP without sphincter of Oddi manometry (odds ratio 0.72: 95% CI[0.08, 9.2]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that biliary sphincterotomy (p=0.006) and pancreatography (p=0.03) were independent predictors of acute pancreatitis.\nContext 5: Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction patients were four times more likely (odds ratio = 4.6) to have evidence of chronic pancreatitis than were those with bile duct stone. The risk of pancreatitis was higher in patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction who underwent sphincter of Oddi manometry and ERCP compared with those who had ERCP without manometry (odds ratio = 0.72).", "Yes, trauma patients with a previous organ transplant have better outcomes than expected.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Mean homocysteine concentrations increased by 6% (95% CI 2-10%) during the treatment with coumarin derivatives. This corresponds to a 1 mumol/L increase in homocysteine concentration. After the anticoagulant treatment period, the concentrations decreased again. We determined that this slight increase does not influence the interpretation of epidemiological studies. We also observed no significant effect of anticoagulants on homocysteine concentration after 13 weeks of treatment of healthy volunteers (decrease of 3.6%, or approximately 0.6 micromol/L; 95% CI -17.5-8.5%).\nContext 2: In this study we used two different groups to investigate the effect of coumarin derivatives on homocysteine concentrations. Homocysteine levels were measured in 40 patients who were on the waiting list for orthopedic surgery and who were expected to receive prophylactic anticoagulant therapy after the operation. Measurements were taken before the operation, as well as during and after coumarin therapy. Homocysteine concentrations were also measured in a second study group consisting of 12 healthy volunteers who were treated with oral anticoagulants.\nContext 3: High circulating levels of homocysteine are a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. This association has been established in numerous case-control studies. In some of these studies, patients were treated with anticoagulants at the time of venapuncture. It is not clear whether homocysteine concentrations are influenced by anticoagulants. If anticoagulation does, indeed, have an effect on homocysteine levels, it might underestimate or overestimate the possible association of homocysteine levels and vascular disease.\nContext 4: The effects of HIV serostatus and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) on plasma homocysteine (HCY) are uncertain.\nContext 5: Infusion of RL or one of the three HES solutions exerts an anticoagulant effect as demonstrated by a increase in clot formation time (R) and a decrease in maximum amplitude (MA), and the angle.

Within the infant group, best results are obtained with adult-sized kidneys (ASKs) rather than size-compatible pediatric kidneys. However, transplantation of ASKs into infants has an increased risk of acute tubular necrosis and graft loss from vascular thrombosis and primary nonfunction. The aim of this study was to define and understand the hemodynamic changes induced by ASK transplantation, so that outcomes of transplantation in infants can be improved.\nContext 2: Mean infant aortic blood flows were 331+/-148 ml/min before transplantation, 761+/-272 ml/ min at 8-12 days after transplantation (P=0.0006 with pretransplant flow), and 665+/-138 ml/min at 4-6 months after transplantation (P=0.0001 with pretransplant flow). Mean transplanted renal artery flows were 385+/-158 ml/min at 8-12 days and 296+/-113 ml/min at 4-6 months after transplantation. Transplanted renal artery flows were less than prenephrectomy in situ donor renal artery blood flow (618+/-130 ml/min; P=0.02 and P=0.0003) and expected normal renal artery blood flow (666+/-87 ml/min; P=0.003 and P=0.001) at both 8-12 days and 4-6 months after transplantation. A 26% reduction in renal volume (P=0.003) occurred between the two postoperative time periods, and this paralleled the decrease in posttransplant renal artery flow. One-year graft and patient survival in the nine infants was 100%. The mean serum creatinine levels at 3, 6, and 12 months were 0.43+/-0.10, 0.48+/-0.15, and 0.49+/-0.16 mg/dl.\nContext 3: Nine hemodynamically stable and optimally hydrated infants were studied under a controlled sedation with cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance at three time periods: before transplantation, 8-12 days after transplantation, and 4-6 months after transplantation. Cross-sectional images of both the infant aorta and the adult transplant renal artery were obtained and blood flow was quantitated. Renal volumes were also obtained, and expected renal artery blood flow based on the pretransplant renal volume was calculated. The mean aortic blood flow was 331+/-148 ml/min before transplantation, 761+/-272 ml/min at 8-12 days after transplantation, and 665+/-138 ml/min at 4-6 months after transplantation. The mean renal artery blood flow was 385+/-158 ml/min at 8-12 days and 296+/-113 ml/min at 4-6 months after transplantation. The mean renal volume was 0.9+/-0.2 liters at 8-12 days and 0.7+/-0.2 liters at 4-6 months after transplantation.

We proposed that polyethylene glycol diisocyanate (PEG-DISO), a polymer that rapidly forms covalent linkages with amine residues on proteins, could mask thrombogenic vascular wall proteins from platelets, thereby abrogating acute platelet deposition.\nContext 2: To test this hypothesis, we isolated the femoral arteries of 10 New Zealand White rabbits and injured them with 3 passes of a 2F Fogarty catheter which was inserted through a distal arteriotomy. Immediately after balloon injury, (111)indium-labeled autologous platelets were infused peripherally and the injured femoral arteries were randomly treated for 1 minute with a PEG-DISO solution in one artery and a control solution of the phosphate buffered saline vehicle in the contralateral artery. Following treatment, reflow was initiated. The vessels were harvested after 1 hour and radioactivity was quantified in a gamma counter. Platelet counts were standardized by weight and expressed as platelets/mg (mean +/- SEM). Platelet deposition onto arteries treated with PEG-DISO was (1.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(6) platelets/mg compared to (5.6 +/- 4.2) x 10(6) platelets/mg onto the contralateral control arteries treated with vehicle (P < 0.005). Scanning electron micrographs of the injured vessel segment confirmed qualitatively less platelet deposition on the treated segments than on the control segments.\nContext 3: Thirty domestic juvenile pigs of weight 20-30 kg were anesthetized. A left angiogram was performed via a femoral artery. Proximal left anterior descending and circumflex arteries were dilated three times with a 20-30% oversized coronary angioplasty balloon catheter. Fifteen animals were allocated randomly to receive intravenous infusions of poloxamer 188, starting 30 min before angioplasty and continuing for 24 h. The remaining 15 received intravenous 0.45% saline and served as controls. The animals were killed 2 weeks after the angioplasty. Histologic studies of the arteries were performed. The severity of the injury and the amount of thrombus material incorporated in the neointima were assessed by semiquantitative methods.\nContext 4: The results showed that the poloxamer 188 group had significantly less thrombus material incorporated in the neointima than the saline group (P < 0.05). The poloxamer 188 group also had significantly less intimal hyperplasia than the saline group (P < 0.05).\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that poloxamer 188 may be a useful adjunct to angioplasty in the treatment of coronary artery disease.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that poloxamer 188 may be a useful adjunct to angioplasty in the treatment of coronary artery disease.\nContext 7: The results of this study suggest that poloxamer 188 may be a useful adjunct", "Contexts:\nContext 1: A genome-wide scan of BI in Nordic Red dairy cattle detected major QTL on BTA6, 14 and 23. The strongest associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on BTA23 was located at 13,313,896 bp with [Formula: see text]. Analyses of component traits showed that the QTL had a large effect on stillbirth. Based on the 10 most strongly associated SNPs with stillbirth, we constructed a haplotype. Among this haplotype's alleles, HAPQTL had a large negative effect on stillbirth. No animals were found to be homozygous for HAPQTL. Analysis of stillbirth records that were categorized by carrier status for HAPQTL of the sire and maternal grandsire suggested that this haplotype had a recessive mode of inheritance. Illumina BovineHD BeadChip genotypes and genotype intensity data indicated a chromosomal deletion between 12.28 and 12.81 Mbp on BTA23. An independent set of Illumina Bovine50k BeadChip genotypes identified a recessive lethal haplotype that spanned the deleted region.\nContext 2: A whole-genome association study of 4631 progeny-tested Nordic Red dairy cattle bulls using imputed next-generation sequencing data revealed a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) that affects birth index (BI) on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 23. We analyzed this QTL to identify which of the component traits of BI are affected and understand its molecular basis.\nContext 3: One of the six experimental calves never showed any haematological, clinical or pathological evidence of BNP. In the other five calves, thrombocyte and leukocyte counts dropped within a few hours following ingestion of colostrum. Of those, three calves developed clinical signs of BNP, their post-mortem examination revealed bone marrow depletion. Of the remaining two calves, a pair of mixed twins, marked thrombocytopenia and recurrent leukocytopenia was evident in one, in which only slight changes in the bone marrow were detected, while in the other thrombocyte counts dropped, but rebounded later, and no bone marrow changes were noted. Thrombocyte counts of the experimental calves were statistically significantly lower than those of the control calves at 2 hours post ingestion of colostrum and at every sampling point between 9 hours and 8 days post ingestion of colostrum. The bone marrow of the experimental calves was depleted of thrombocytes and leukocytes, and the bone marrow of the control calves was not depleted of these cells. The bone marrow of the experimental calves was depleted of erythrocytes, and the bone marrow of the control calves was not depleted of erythrocytes. The bone marrow of the experimental calves was depleted of megakaryocytes, and the bone marrow of the control calves was not depleted of megakaryocytes.

Animals in both groups were subjected to focal ischemia by filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Pericranial temperature was servocontrolled at 37 degrees C throughout the experiment. In the awake group, isoflurane was discontinued and the animals were allowed to awaken. In the isoflurane group, isoflurane anesthesia was maintained at 1.5 times the minimum alveolar concentration. After 70 min of focal ischemia, the filament was removed. Animals were killed 2 days (awake, n = 18; isoflurane, n = 17) and 14 days (awake, n = 18; isoflurane, n = 17) after ischemia. The volumes of cerebral infarction and selective neuronal necrosis in the animals were determined by image analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained coronal brain sections.\nContext 2: Several investigations have shown that volatile anesthetics can reduce ischemic cerebral injury. In these studies, however, neurologic injury was evaluated only after a short recovery period. Recent data suggest that injury caused by ischemia is a dynamic process characterized by continual neuronal loss for a prolonged period. Whether isoflurane-mediated neuroprotection is sustained after a longer recovery period is not known. The current study was conducted to compare the effect of isoflurane on brain injury after short (2-day) and long (14-day) recovery periods in rats subjected to focal ischemia.\nContext 3: Intracerebral hemorrhage is a subtype of stroke that has a poor prognosis without an adequate therapy. Recently, the use of anesthetics such as isoflurane has been shown to be protective after cerebral ischemia. However, the potential therapeutic effect of isoflurane after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has not been fully explored.\nContext 4: Brief administration of isoflurane 3\u2009min before and 2\u2009min after the initiation of early reperfusion reduced infarct size (56\u2009\u00b1\u20098% of left ventricular area at risk, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation) compared with controls (68\u2009\u00b1\u20094%) in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. The protective effect of isoflurane was associated with a reduction in infarct size and a decrease in infarct-associated neutrophil infiltration. The protective effect of isoflurane was not associated with a reduction in infarct size or a decrease in infarct-associated neutrophil infiltration in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.\nContext 5: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of isoflurane on the development of cerebral ischemic injury in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The results showed that isoflurane significantly reduced infarct volume and infarct-associated neutrophil", "Contexts:\nContext 1: miR-30a was significantly downregulated in highly metastatic CRC cell lines and metastatic tissues. Overexpression of miR-30a suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro and liver metastasis in vivo, whereas miR-30a deletion dramatically promoted cell migration and invasion. Further studies revealed that PIK3CD is a direct target of miR-30a as miR-30a bounds directly to the 3'-UTR of PIK3CD, subsequently reducing its expression. Similar to the restoring miR-30a expression, PIK3CD downregulation inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas PIK3CD overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-30a. Moreover, significant downregulation of miR-30a in metastatic CRC tissues was found to be inversely correlated with PIK3CD expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-30a down-regulated the expression of key components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, whereas PIK3CD overexpression reversed this negative effect.\nContext 2: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in tumor metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine the regulation and function of miR-30a in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) metastasis.\nContext 3: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been associated with tumorigenesis in various cancers. miR-544a is an understudied miRNA that has recently been implicated in regulating invasion in lung cancer. However, its role in regulating invasion and the underlying mechanism have not been investigated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.\nContext 4: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the development and progression of human malignancy. MiR-143 as a tumor suppressor, is decreased in malignant tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the potential mechanism of miR-143 in CRC remains largely unknown.\nContext 5: The expression of miR-30a was detected in CRC cell lines and samples by qRT-PCR. The anti-metastatic effect of miR-30a was determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine target association between miR-30a and phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD). The expression of PIK3CD was determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The effect of PIK3CD on cell migration and invasion was determined by wound healing and transwell assays. The expression of PIK3CD was determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The effect of PIK3CD on cell migration and invasion was determined by wound healing and transwell assays.\nContext 6: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miR-30a is a member of the miR-30 family, which is known to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Three 24-h urine samples were collected for the assessment of urinary sodium and one sample was taken for urinary iodine concentrations (UICs) in a convenience sample of 262 adult men and women in Cape Town, South Africa. Median UIC was compared across categories of sodium excretion equivalent to salt intakes lower than 5, 5 to 9, and greater than or equal to 9 g/d.\nContext 2: For some endocrine and nutritional biomarkers, for example, cortisol and vitamin B(12), significant associations between 24-hour renal analyte excretion and the respective 24-hour urine volume (U-Vol) have been reported. Therefore, our objective was to investigate whether 24-hour U-Vol (a marker of fluid intake) is also a relevant influencing factor of absolute daily iodine excretion.\nContext 3: The median UIC was 120 \u03bcg/L (interquartile range 75.3-196.3), indicating iodine sufficiency. Less one-fourth (23.2%) of subjects had urinary sodium excretion values within the desirable range (salt <5 g/d), 50.7% had high values (5-9 g/d), and 22.8% had very high values (\u22659 g/d). No association between urinary iodine and mean 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a024-h urinary sodium concentration was found (r\u00a0=\u00a00.087, P\u00a0=\u00a00.198) and UIC status did not differ according to urinary sodium categories (P\u00a0=\u00a00.804).\nContext 4: Urinary iodine excretion was significantly associated with 24-hour U-Vol in all performed fully adjusted regression models. A 1-L increase of U-Vol predicted an additional 15.0\u2009\u03bcg/day (adolescents, 95% confidence interval: [9.8, 20.0], p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 16.5\u2009\u03bcg/day (women, 95% confidence interval: [9.2, 23.7], p\u2009=\u20090.0002) increase in iodine excretion. The longitudinal analysis in adolescents revealed a stronger relation of iodine excretion with U-Vol in girls than in boys (\u03b2\u2009=\u200917.1 vs. \u03b2\u2009=\u200910.5).\nContext 5: Urinary iodine excretion rates were measured in repeatedly collected 24-h urine samples from 262 adult men and women in Cape Town, South Africa. The median UIC was 120 \u03bcg/L (interquartile range 75.3-196.3), indicating iodine sufficiency. Less one-fourth (23.2%) of subjects had urinary sodium excretion values within the desirable range (salt <5 g/d), 50.7% had high values (5-9 g/d), and 22.8% had very high values (\u22659 g/d).

This technique has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of esophageal cancer. The main advantage of MIE is that it reduces the amount of blood loss and the duration of surgery, which can lead to a shorter hospital stay and a faster recovery. Additionally, MIE allows for a more rapid return to normal activities, which can improve the quality of life for patients.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Histamine, a key chemical mediator in allergic reaction, exhibits an array of pro-inflammatory effects that include the activation of fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether histamine could stimulate nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts to express vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, a surface molecule involved in structural-inflammatory cell interaction and whether levocetirizine could inhibit this induction.\nContext 2: Primary nasal polyp tissue-derived fibroblasts were stimulated with histamine (10-1000 microM) or interleukin (IL)-4 plus tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (0.5-5 ng/mL) and VCAM-1 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. The inhibitory effect of the selective H1-antagonist levocetirizine (0.01-10.0 microM) on VCAM-1 expression was also tested.\nContext 3: Compared with unstimulated cultures, histamine or IL-4 + TNF-alpha, at the highest concentrations tested, significantly increase VCAM-1 expression (p < 0.05). To evaluate the ability of levocetirizine to downregulate VCAM-1 expression, fibroblasts were stimulated with histamine (1000 microM) or IL-4 + TNF-alpha (5 ng/mL), in the presence of the drug (0.01-10.0 microM). The histamine-induced VCAM-1 expression was effectively inhibited by levocetirizine (0.1-10.0 microM) (p < 0.05). No effect of the drug on IL-4 + TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 expression was observed.\nContext 4: Cultured keratinocytes constitutively expressed the H1 receptor mRNA and protein, which was not influenced by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-4. H1 but not H2 agonists induced calcium fluxes in keratinocytes. Treatment of keratinocytes with histamine (10 -7 to 10 -4 mol/L) or beta-histine increased the IFN-gamma-induced expression of membrane intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and MHC class I but not MHC class II molecules. Moreover, H1 stimulation promoted basal CC chemokine ligand (CCL)-5/RANTES and GM-CSF secretion and augmented IFN-gamma-induced CCL-5/RANTES and GM-CSF secretion. H1 stimulation also increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in keratinocytes. The H1 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, inhibited the H1-induced VCAM-1 expression. The H1 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, also inhibited the H1-induced GM-CSF and CCL-5/RANTES secretion. The H1 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, also inhibited the H1-induced IFN-gamma-induced CCL-5/RANTES and GM-CSF secretion. The H1 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, also inhibited the H1-induced IFN-gamma-induced CCL-5/RANTES and", "Question: Does propofol anesthesia in children induce sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes??\nYes, propofol anesthesia in children induces sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes.\nThe formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in metaphase chromosomes of T-lymphocytes of children as a marker for possible genotoxocity following total intravenous anesthesia with propofol for minor surgical procedures.\nThe formation of SCE in mitogen-stimulated T-lymphocytes of 40 children undergoing sevoflurane anaesthesia for minor surgical procedures.\nSlightly elevated SCE rates were obtained in T-lymphocytes of girls compared to boys, but these differences did not reach statistical significance.\nChildren undergoing multiple sessions of radiation therapy", "Contexts:\nContext 1: RAS and PIK3CA mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have been associated with worse survival. We sought to evaluate the impact of RAS and PIK3CA mutations on cumulative incidence of metastasis to potentially curable sites of liver and lung and other sites such as bone and brain.\nContext 2: RAS mutations have been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). However, the impact of RAS mutations on response to chemotherapy remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between RAS mutations and response to preoperative chemotherapy and their impact on survival in patients undergoing curative resection of CLM.\nContext 3: Among the 918 patients identified, 477 cases were RAS wild type, and 441 cases had a RAS mutation (394 at KRAS exon 2, 29 at KRAS exon 3 or 4, and 18 in NRAS). RAS mutation was significantly associated with shorter median overall survival (OS) and on multivariate analysis independently predicted worse OS (HR, 1.6; P <\u2009.01). RAS mutant mCRC exhibited a significantly higher cumulative incidence of lung, bone, and brain metastasis and on multivariate analysis was an independent predictor of involvement of these sites (HR, 1.5, 1.6, and 3.7, respectively). PIK3CA mutations occurred in 10% of the 786 cases genotyped, did not predict for worse survival, and did not exhibit a site-specific pattern of metastatic spread.\nContext 4: The identification of RAS status (KRAS and NRAS) has changed the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The impact of the RAS mutation on cytotoxic chemotherapy efficacy has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, several retrospective studies suggest a greater efficacy of oxaliplatin in mCRC with KRAS mutation.\nContext 5: Optimal morphologic response and major pathologic response were more common in patients with wild-type RAS (32.9 and 58.9%, respectively) than in patients with RAS mutations (10.5 and 36.8%; P = 0.006 and 0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that wild-type RAS was a strong predictor of optimal morphologic response [odds ratio (OR), 4.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.83-10.32; P = 0.001] and major pathologic response (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 1.60-9.99; P = 0.002). Wild-type RAS was also a strong predictor of survival (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.64; P = 0.001).\nContext 6: The impact of RAS mutations on response to preoperative chemotherapy and their impact on survival in patients undergoing curative resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) remains unclear.

All animals received ceftriaxone, and glycerol or placebo. Brain damage, hearing loss, and inflammatory parameters were assessed.\nContext 2: Bacterial meningitis in children causes high rates of mortality and morbidity. In a recent clinical trial, oral glycerol significantly reduced severe neurological sequelae in paediatric meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, and a tendency towards a benefit of adjunctive glycerol was seen in pneumococcal meningitis.\nContext 3: The role played by pneumolysin and autolysin in pneumococcal meningitis is poorly understood.\nContext 4: High mortality and morbidity rates are observed in patients with bacterial meningitis (BM) and urge for new adjuvant treatments in addition to standard antibiotic therapies. In BM the hippocampal dentate gyrus is injured by apoptosis while in cortical areas ischemic necrosis occurs. Experimental therapies aimed at reducing the inflammatory response and brain damage have successfully been evaluated in animal models of BM. Fluoxetine (FLX) is an anti-depressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and was previously shown to be neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo. We therefore assessed the neuroprotective effect of FLX in experimental pneumococcal meningitis.\nContext 5: During the study period, the incidences of invasive pneumococcal disease in children < 2 years of age (104.4 cases per 10(5) person-years and 16.1 cases per 10(5) person-years for invasive pneumococcal disease and meningitis, respectively) and in children 0 to 59 months of age (59.5 cases per 10(5) person-years for invasive pneumococcal disease and 7.7 cases per 10(5) person-years for meningitis) were twice those reported previously through the passive surveillance system. Overall, 67% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from children < 5 years of age belonged to 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes and 18% to vaccine-related serotypes (mainly serotype 19A).

The present study was undertaken to quantitate the reduction of adventitial elastin for small AAA, to determine whether the loss of this structural component parallels aneurysm growth, and to examine the ultrastructure of the remaining elastin elements. The results of this study indicate that the loss of adventitial elastin is a primary event in the pathogenesis of AAA.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We chose human and eleven other high-coverage mammalian genome data-as well as an avian genome as an outgroup-to analyze orthologous protein-coding genes using nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates. After evaluating eight commonly-used methods of Ka and Ks calculation, we observed that these methods yielded a nearly uniform result when estimating Ka, but not Ks (or Ka/Ks). When sorting genes based on Ka, we noticed that fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes often belonged to different functional classes, with respect to species-specificity and lineage-specificity. In particular, we identified two functional classes of genes in the acquired immune system. Fast-evolving genes coded for signal-transducing proteins, such as receptors, ligands, cytokines, and CDs (cluster of differentiation, mostly surface proteins), whereas the slow-evolving genes were for function-modulating proteins, such as kinases and adaptor proteins. In addition, among slow-evolving genes that had functions related to the central nervous system, neurodegenerative disease-related pathways were enriched significantly in most mammalian species. We also confirmed that gene expression was negatively correlated with evolution rate, i.e. slow-evolving genes were expressed at higher levels than fast-evolving genes. Our results indicated that the functional specializations of the three major mammalian clades were: sensory perception and oncogenesis in primates, reproduction and hormone regulation in large mammals, and immunity and angiotensin in rodents.\nContext 2: Despite rapid progress in understanding the mechanisms that shape the evolution of proteins, the relative importance of various factors remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have assessed the effects of 16 different biological features on the evolutionary rates (ERs) of protein-coding sequences in bacterial genomes.\nContext 3: We show that in bacteria stop codons evolve slower than synonymous sites, suggesting the action of weak negative selection. However, the frequency of stop codons relative to genomic nucleotide content indicated that this selection regime is not straightforward. The frequency of TAA and TGA stop codons is GC-content dependent, with TAA decreasing and TGA increasing with GC-content, while TAG frequency is independent of GC-content. Applying a formal, analytical model to these data we found that the relationship between stop codon frequencies and nucleotide content cannot be explained by mutational biases or selection on nucleotide content. However, with weak nucleotide content-dependent selection on TAG, -0.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22123\u2009yr\u22121, the model predicts that stop codon frequencies should be lower than expected. We find that this prediction is consistent with the observed frequency of stop codons in bacteria. We also show that the observed relationship between stop codon frequencies and GC-content is consistent with the predictions of a model that assumes that stop codons are under weak selection on nucleotide content.\nContext 4: The evolution of protein-coding genes is a complex process that involves both positive and negative selection. The relative importance of these forces is not well understood. Here we use a novel approach to estimate the relative importance of positive and negative selection on the evolution of protein-coding genes. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the relative importance of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We retrospectively collected medical records of 829 patients with symptomatic leiomyomas in The University of Tokyo Hospital. All the patients underwent abdominal or laparoscopic surgeries between January 2001 and December 2010 and the presence or absence of endometriosis during surgery was analyzed. Possible determinant to predict coexistent endometriosis was statistically investigated.\nContext 2: In total, 105 leiomyoma cases (12.7% in 829 patients) were diagnosed with endometriosis. Patients with small dominant leiomyomas were significantly complicated by peritoneal endometriotic implants (small leiomyomas were classified as < 8 cm). The patients with both diagnoses were more likely to be infertile and at age 39 years or younger than those with leiomyoma alone.\nContext 3: Uterine leiomyomas occur in 30-70% of reproductive-age women. Leiomyoma reduce implantation, increase miscarriage risk, and increase menstrual bleeding. We hypothesized that endometrial defects induced by leiomyoma result in menorrhagia and reproductive dysfunction.\nContext 4: Human endometria of women with single intramural leiomyomas (group A, <5 cm and group B, > or =5 cm) and controls (group C) were collected on day LH+7 and processed for histology and gene expression analysis, using different methods and validated by quantitative RT-PCR. To compare in vitro fertilization outcome, a total of 1035 cases from our oocyte donation database were included, comprising patients with one fibroid less than 5 cm (A1, n = 532); two leiomyomas less than 5 cm (A2, n = 128); three or more leiomyomas less than 5 cm (A3, n = 125); one fibroid 5 cm or greater (B, n = 22); and two control groups: C1 (n = 93), women with previous myomectomy; and C2 (n = 135), women without uterine pathology treated on the same dates as C1.\nContext 5: We evaluated the effect of leiomyoma on endometrial gene expression essential for implantation and hemostasis both in vivo and in primary endometrial stromal cells (ESC).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n1.

The study was conducted in an assisted reproductive treatment programme between January 1996 and December 2000. Throughout the study period, oocyte donors and recipients followed a standard synchronization regimen that did not vary. A serum E(2) level (peak E(2)) was obtained from all oocyte donors on the morning of HCG administration. Peak E(2) values were grouped by 33rd percentile (group I, <1500 pg", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We established a dietary model of increased vs decreased FGF21 by feeding C57BL/6J mice with KDs, either depleted of protein or enriched with protein. We furthermore used wild-type and Fgf21-knockout mice that were subjected to the respective diets, and monitored energy and glucose homeostasis as well as tumour growth after transplantation of Lewis lung carcinoma cells.\nContext 2: Ketogenic diets (KDs) have increasingly gained attention as effective means for weight loss and potential adjunctive treatment of cancer. The metabolic benefits of KDs are regularly ascribed to enhanced hepatic secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and its systemic effects on fatty-acid oxidation, energy expenditure (EE) and body weight. Ambiguous data from Fgf21-knockout animal strains and low FGF21 concentrations reported in humans with ketosis have nevertheless cast doubt regarding the endogenous function of FGF21. We here aimed to elucidate the causal role of FGF21 in mediating the therapeutic benefits of KDs on metabolism and cancer.\nContext 3: Hepatic and circulating, but not adipose tissue, FGF21 levels were profoundly increased by protein starvation, independent of the state of ketosis. We demonstrate that endogenous FGF21 is not essential for the maintenance of normoglycaemia upon protein and carbohydrate starvation and is therefore not needed for the effects of KDs on EE. Furthermore, the tumour-suppressing effects of KDs were independent of FGF21 and, rather, driven by concomitant protein and carbohydrate starvation.\nContext 4: The ketogenic diet was well accepted by the KD mice. The tumour growth in the KD group was significantly delayed compared to that in the SD group. Tumours in the KD group reached the target tumour volume at 34.2 +/- 8.5 days versus only 23.3 +/- 3.9 days in the SD group. After day 20, tumours in the KD group grew faster although the differences in mean tumour growth continued significantly. Importantly, they revealed significantly larger necrotic areas than tumours of the SD group and the areas with vital tumour cells appear to have had fewer vessels than tumours of the SD group. Viable tumour cells in the border zone surrounding the necrotic areas of tumours of both groups exhibited a glycolytic phenotype with expression of glucose transporter-1 and transketolase-like 1. The glycolytic phenotype was not observed in the SD group. The glycolytic phenotype was also not observed in the SD group. The glycolytic phenotype was also not observed in the SD group.

Based on the direction of ST-segment shift, the patients were categorized into two groups: the ST-segment elevation group (n = 27) and the depression group (n = 22). There were no differences in age, gender, or cardiovascular risk factors between the two groups. The distribution of the spastic site in the LAD was also similar. A total reduction in luminal diameter during a provoked attack was more often observed in the ST-segment elevation group than in the ST-segment depression group (37% vs 9%, p = 0.02). Collateral circulation to the LAD was found in only one patient in each group. There were no differences between the two groups in heart rate, systolic BP, and double product of heart rate and systolic BP during the attack. The incidence of acetylcholine-induced anginal attack with U-wave inversion in the ST-segment depression group was nearly as high as that in the ST-segment elevation group (77% vs 78%, p > 0.99).\nContext 3: We studied 49 patients with vasospastic angina whose vasospasm was induced in the LAD, not in the left circumflex coronary artery, by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine.\nContext 4: We analyzed 35 TCD studies in 19 patients (mean age 53 \u00b1 13 years). Thirteen studies (37%) showed ultrasonographic evidence of vasospasm. Systolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and ICP were not significantly affected by HOB position. The mean MFV of the MCA was 101.0 \u00b1 47.3 cm/s with 0\u00b0-15\u00b0 HOB position versus 100.1 \u00b1 46.8 cm/s with 30\u00b0-45\u00b0 HOB position (P = 0.77 on paired t test). HOB position did not have a significant influence on MFV regardless of the presence of vasospasm.\nContext 5: The presence of low-density areas on CT is used in clinical decision-making regarding treatment of angiographic vasospasm as well as in the diagnosis of vasospasm. We studied 20 patients with vasospasm of the LAD and 20 patients with vasospasm of the LCX. The presence of low-density areas on CT was significantly more common in patients with vasospasm of the LAD than in those with vasospasm of the LCX (p = 0.02). The presence of low-density areas on CT was not associated with the presence of ST-segment elevation on ECG. The presence of low-density areas on CT was not associated with the presence of ST-segment elevation on ECG. The presence of low-density areas on CT was not associated with the presence of ST-segment elevation on ECG.\nContext 6: We studied", "Question: Do anti-oxidants prevent bile acid-induced cell death in rat hepatocytes??\nYes, anti-oxidants prevent bile acid-induced cell death in rat hepatocytes.\nThe bile acids, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurolithocholic acid-3 sulphate (TLCAS), are potent inducers of apoptosis in rat hepatocytes.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nThe study population consisted of 236 outpatients (146 males and 90 females) with a mean age 69.7\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\u2009years.

Patient-reported outcomes, including the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), were obtained by online questionnaires prior to surgery. Knee pathology was assessed by the operating surgeons using a modified version of the International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine (ISAKOS) classification of meniscal tears questionnaire, supplemented with information extracted from surgery reports. Following hypothesis-driven preselection of candidate variables, backward elimination regressions were performed to investigate associations between patient-reported outcomes and structural knee pathologies.\nContext 2: Certain aspects of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in severely and morbidly obese (SMO) patients (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m(2)) remain controversial. This study aimed to assess the duration of TKA surgery and hospital stay in relation to patients' BMI.\nContext 3: There is no consensus on the impact of radiographic severity of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) on the clinical outcome of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We assessed whether preoperative radiographic severity of OA is related to improvements in functioning, pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 1 year after THA or TKA.\nContext 4: Previous studies dealing with gait after minimally invasive surgery (MIS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are rare and insufficient. It was the purpose of the study to determine in a prospective, comparative setting whether MIS influences the outcome of TKA in terms of typical 3D gait parameters.\nContext 5: One stage exchange of a chronically infected total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is recommended in selected cases only. However, there is little evidence regarding the usefulness of selection criteria. The goal of this retrospective study was to compare the results of two concomitant cohorts of patients with chronically infected TKA: one treated with a routine one-stage exchange (study group) and one treated with one-stage exchange in selected cases only (control group). The hypoyhesis tested was that the failure rate and repeat surgery rate were higher in the study group.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 3D motion analysis system on the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 3D motion analysis system on the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 3D motion analysis system on the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 3D motion analysis system on", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Genomic imprinting refers to an epigenetic marking resulting in monoallelic gene expression and has a critical role in fetal development. Various imprinting diseases have recently been reported in humans and animals born after the use of assisted reproductive technology (ART). All the epimutations implicated involve a loss of methylation of the maternal allele (demethylation of KvDMR1/KCNQ1OT1 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), demethylation of SNRPN in Angelman syndrome and demethylation of DMR2/IGF2R in large offspring syndrome), suggesting that ART impairs the acquisition or maintenance of methylation marks on maternal imprinted genes. However, it is unknown whether this epigenetic imprinting error is random or restricted to a specific imprinted domain.\nContext 2: Loss of function mutations in the genes encoding the pancreatic \u03b2-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel are identified in approximately 80% of patients with diazoxide unresponsive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH). For a small number of patients HH can occur as part of a multisystem disease such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). In approximately 20% of patients, BWS results from chromosome 11 paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), which causes dysregulation of imprinted growth regulation genes at 11p15.5. There is a considerable range in the clinical features and phenotypic severity associated with BWS which is likely to be due to somatic mosaicism. The cause of HH in these patients is not known.\nContext 3: To analyse the methylation status of various imprinted genes (IGF2R gene at 6q26, PEG1/MEST at 7q32, KCNQ1OT1 and H19 at 11p15.5, and SNRPN at 15q11-13) in 40 patients with BWS showing a loss of methylation at KCNQ1OT1 (11 patients with BWS born after the use of ART and 29 patients with BWS conceived naturally).\nContext 4: Genomic imprinting in mammals is thought to result from epigenetic modifications to chromosomes during gametogenesis, which leads to differential allelic expression during development. There is a requirement for an appropriate experimental system to enable the analysis of the mechanisms of genomic imprinting during embryogenesis.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the imprinted gene KCNQ1OT1 in the development of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) in a mouse model of BWS.\nContext 6: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a common genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth, macroglossia, and an increased risk of malignancy. The molecular basis of BWS is unknown. We have previously shown that the imprinted gene KCNQ1OT1 is epigenetically silenced in BWS patients. Here, we show that the imprinted gene KCNQ1OT1 is epigenetically silenced in BWS patients and that the loss of KCNQ1OT1 expression", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Previously, it was reported that T-lymphocytes derived from non-pregnant mice promote murine embryo implantation. In order to examine the immunological regulation of endometrial receptivity in humans, the effects of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on endometrial epithelial cell (EEC) function were monitored by a newly developed attachment assay using primary human EEC culture and BeWo cell-derived spheroids.\nContext 2: The in vitro adhesion of human endometrial epithelial cells to human mesothelial cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by TNF-alpha (P=0.0007), IL-6 (P<0.0001) and IL-8 (P=0.0004).\nContext 3: A key factor in the pathogenesis of endometriosis is the endometrial-peritoneal adhesion. To study the pathogenesis of endometriosis, a quantitative in vitro assay (QIVA) was developed to measure in vitro adhesion between human endometrial epithelial cells and mesothelial cells using commercially available cell lines. Using the QIVA, the hypothesis was tested that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) promote adhesion of endometrial epithelial cells to mesothelial cells.\nContext 4: Using two human endometrial cell lines characterized by low and high receptivity, we identified the membrane receptor CD98 as a novel molecule selectively and significantly associated with the receptive phenotype. In human endometrial samples, CD98 was the only molecule studied whose expression was restricted to the implantation window in human endometrial tissue. CD98 expression was restricted to the apical surface and included in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains of primary endometrial epithelial cells, as demonstrated by the biochemical association between CD98 and tetraspanin CD9. CD98 expression was induced in vitro by treatment of primary endometrial epithelial cells with human chorionic gonadotropin, 17-\u03b2-estradiol, LIF or EGF. Endometrial overexpression of CD98 or tetraspanin CD9 greatly enhanced mouse blastocyst adhesion, while their siRNA-mediated depletion reduced the blastocyst adhesion rate.\nContext 5: Are levels of circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) affected by the menstrual cycle? We measured CACs in peripheral blood of 30 women during the follicular, luteal and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. CACs were significantly higher in the mid-luteal phase compared with the follicular and luteal phases (P<0.001). CACs were significantly higher in the mid-luteal phase compared with the follicular phase (P<0.001). CACs were significantly higher in the mid-luteal phase compared with the luteal phase (P<0.001). CACs were significantly higher in the mid-luteal phase compared with the follicular phase (P<0.001).

We hypothesized that specific areas of the DC tissue are sustaining the cell proliferation and studied the potential molecular determinants that might contribute to the formation of such niches.\nContext 2: Dupuytren's Disease (DD) is a debilitating contractile fibrosis of the palmar fascia characterised by excess collagen deposition, contractile myofibroblast development, increased transforming growth factor-beta levels and beta-catenin accumulation. The aim of this study was to determine if a collagen-enriched environment, similar to in vivo conditions, altered beta-catenin accumulation by primary DD cells in the presence or absence of transforming growth factor-beta.\nContext 3: Dupuytren's contracture or disease (DD) is a fibro-proliferative disease of the hand that results in finger flexion contractures. Increased cellular beta-catenin levels have been identified as characteristic of this disease. As Wnts are the most widely recognized upstream regulators of cellular beta-catenin accumulation, we have examined Wnt gene expression in surgical specimens and in DD-derived primary cell cultures grown in two-dimensional monolayer culture or in three-dimensional FPCL collagen lattice cultures.\nContext 4: We found that proliferative cells in the DC nodules were concentrated in the immediate vicinity of small blood vessels and localized predominantly in the myofibroblast layer. Correspondingly, the DC-associated blood vessels contained increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, a hallmark of activated growth factor signaling. When studying the expression of potential activators of AKT signaling we found that the expression of bFGF was confined to the endothelium of the small blood vessels, IGF-2 was present uniformly in the DC tissue and CTGF was expressed in the DC-associated sweat gland acini. In addition, the blood vessels in DC nodules contained increased amounts of laminins 511 and 521, which have been previously shown to promote the proliferation and stem cell properties of different cell types.\nContext 5: Angiotensin II (AngII) induces migration and growth of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), which is responsible for vascular remodelling in some cardiovascular diseases. Ang II also activates a Cl(-) current, but the underlying mechanism is not clear.\n\nBased on the above findings, we hypothesized that the DC-associated blood vessels are a source of AngII and that the DC-associated sweat gland acini are a source of CTGF.

Cardiac glutathione was depleted by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO, 4\u00a0mmol/kg/ 48\u00a0h intraperitoneal), or augmented by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 4\u00a0mmol/L) in the perfusion buffer. Cardiac (64)Cu retention from three 2-MBq bolus injections of (64)Cu(ATSM) before and during hypoxia was then monitored by NaI detectors.\nContext 2: The trapping mechanisms of the PET hypoxia imaging agent copper(II)-diacetyl-bis(N (4)-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((64)Cu(ATSM)) remain unresolved, although its reduction prior to dissociation may be mediated by intracellular thiols. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular thiol, and its redox status changes in cancer cells and ischaemic myocardium (two prime applications for (64)Cu(ATSM) PET). We therefore investigated whether modification of intracellular GSH content affects the hypoxia selectivity of (64)Cu(ATSM).\nContext 3: Antioxidant therapy has shown some promise in critical care medicine in which glutathione depletion and heart failure are often seen in critically ill patients. This study was designed to examine the impact of glutathione depletion and the free radical scavenger, metallothionein (MT), on cardiac function.\nContext 4: Cardiac GSH content was elevated by NAC and depleted by BSO (from 7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 to 59.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3\u00a0nmol/mg and 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u00a0nmol/mg protein, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Hypoxia did not affect cardiac GSH content in any group. During normoxia, tracer washed out bi-exponentially, with 13.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7% injected dose being retained; this was not affected by GSH augmentation or depletion. Hypoxia significantly increased tracer retention (to 59.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.3%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7% injected dose; p\u2009<\u20090.05), but this was not affected by GSH augmentation or depletion. During hypoxia, tracer washout was biphasic, with 13.1%\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7% injected dose being retained. This was not affected by GSH augmentation or depletion.\nContext 5: The hypoxia selectivity of (64)Cu(ATSM) was not affected by GSH augmentation or depletion. This suggests that the hypoxia selectivity of (64)Cu(ATSM) is not mediated by intracellular GSH.\nContext 6: The hypoxia selectivity of (64)Cu", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Since using a novel silver-impregnated antimicrobial dressing (Aquacel Ag, ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ) in our pediatric patients with partial-thickness burns, hospital LOS has been significantly reduced. Here we investigated whether there was concomitant cost-effectiveness of this approach.\nContext 2: Burn injury is one of the most common reasons for admission in paediatric population. There is currently no international consensus on the best wound dressing material. Aquacel Ag, a new silver containing hydrofiber dressing material has been reported to produce good clinical results. Yet, only a limited number of studies exist in the paediatric population. This study aims to review our experience of burn management over the past 5\u00a0years and to evaluate the effectiveness of Aquacel Ag in the management of partial thickness burns.\nContext 3: We retrospectively reviewed Burn Registry Data from a large Children's Hospital Burn Unit from January 2005 through August 2005 for inpatients with partial-thickness burns treated with Aquacel Ag. A comparison group was composed of patients from the same period the previous year treated with silver sulfadiazine cream (SSD, Par Pharmaceuticals, Woodcliff, NJ) and matched for age and %TBSA burned. Patients with inhalation injury or full-thickness burns were excluded. Intent-to-treat analysis was limited to patients with less than 22% TBSA burn. Direct costs and total charges were compared statistically after log transformation due to the skewedness of the data.\nContext 4: Silver dressings have been widely and successfully used to prevent cutaneous wounds, including burns, chronic ulcers, dermatitis and other cutaneous conditions, from infection. However, in a few cases, skin discolouration or argyria-like appearances have been reported. This study investigated the level of silver in scar tissue post-burn injury following application of Acticoat, a silver dressing.\nContext 5: Sepsis from burn injuries can result from colonisation of burn wounds, especially in large surface area burns. Reducing bacterial infection will reduce morbidity and mortality, and mortality for severe burns can be as high as 15\u00a0%. There are various quantitative and semi-quantitative techniques to monitor bacterial load on wounds. In the UK, burn wounds are typically monitored for the presence or absence of bacteria through the collection and culture of swabs, but no absolute count is obtained. Quantitative burn wound culture provides a measure of bacterial count and is a useful tool for monitoring burn wound infection. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a new quantitative burn wound culture technique, the burn wound culture swab (BWCS), in monitoring burn wound infection.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new quantitative burn wound culture technique, the burn wound culture swab (BWCS), in monitoring burn wound infection.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new quantitative burn wound culture technique, the burn wound culture swab (BWCS), in monitoring burn wound infection.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new quantitative burn wound culture technique, the burn wound culture swab (BW", "Question: Does single-fraction \u03b3-60Co radiation induce apoptosis in cultured rat C6 cells??\nExplanation: The present study was designed to determine whether a single-fraction \u03b3-60Co radiation can induce apoptosis. The 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiazol-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, apoptosis assays using Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate /propidium iodide or Hoechst 33258 staining, and the cell cycle assay were performed, and the expression of p53 and p21 proteins were evaluated.\nConclusion: To investigate the relationship between radiation-induced apoptosis and clonogenic cell kill in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The results showed that the combination of aspirin and heparin had an excellent effect in inhibiting in vivo acute carotid thrombosis (p < 0.001) and was significantly better than the effect of aspirin alone (p < 0.01) or heparin alone (p < 0.01).\nContext 2: Carotid atherosclerotic thrombosis is an important cause of ischemic stroke in Western countries. The therapeutic efficacy of either aspirin or heparin alone in this setting is still controversial. Recently we developed a simple model, the \"clamp\" method, to induce acute carotid mural thrombosis in vivo in guinea pigs. In this study, we used this model to evaluate the antithrombotic effects of aspirin, heparin, and their combination.\nContext 3: Sixty-four male guinea pigs were divided equally into control, aspirin, heparin, and combined groups. Physiological saline, aspirin (5 mg/kg body wt), heparin (200 units/kg body wt), or a combination of aspirin and heparin, respectively, was injected via the jugular vein before the use of the clamp method. Thirty minutes after the injection of saline or drug(s), P\u00e9an's forceps was used to clamp the carotid artery at a tangent angle for 3 minutes. One hour later, the carotid artery was resected and prepared for observation under a scanning electron microscope or light microscope to evaluate the degree of mural thrombosis.\nContext 4: The study objective was to determine the relative efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparinoid (Orgaran) compared with aspirin for the prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing surgery for fractured hips. A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was used to study 251 consecutive eligible and consenting patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture in seven participating hospitals.\nContext 5: Of 305 patients, 194 (64%) did not receive anticoagulation therapy, 108 (35%) stopped receiving anticoagulation therapy pre-TURP, and 3 (0.98%) underwent TURP while taking aspirin. Anticoagulants used were aspirin (22.6%), warfarin (4.9%), antiplatelets (4.9%), and combination treatments (3.9%). Incidence of post-TURP bleeding was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thrombosis was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thrombosis was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thrombosis was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thrombosis was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thrombosis was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thrombosis was 0.8% (3/305). The incidence of post-TURP thromb", "Question: Does gating of sensory information differ in patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome??\nContext 1: Altered sensory processing in interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome cases may result from a deficiency of the central nervous system to adequately filter incoming visceral afferent information. We used prepulse inhibition as an operational measure of sensorimotor gating to examine early pre-attentive stages of information processing in females with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome and healthy controls.\nContext 2: Using psychophysical methods we compared the effect of the menstrual cycle on bladder sensation in subjects with the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) and in controls.\nContext 3: Patients in a prospective, single", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The intestinal microflora plays a major role in human health. Intestinal flora imbalances are seen in clinical settings, such as cirrhosis, in which bacterial translocation (BT) results in migration of bacteria or bacterial products from the intestinal lumen to extraintestinal sites. In this study, we explored the effect of alterations in gut flora on BT and liver function in cirrhotic rats. The dysfunction of the intestinal barrier is a factor that has been related to bacterial translocation from lumen to extra-intestinal sites and consequently to the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The aim of this study was to investigate if the alterations of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis are related with the degree", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a complex cytokine network drives chronic inflammation and joint destruction. So far, few attempts have been made to identify the cellular sources of individual cytokines systematically. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was systematically to assess the cytokine messenger RNA expression profiles in the five largest cell populations in the synovial fluid and peripheral blood of RA patients. To reflect the in vivo situation as closely as possible, the cells were neither cultured nor stimulated ex vivo.\nContext 2: The detection of cytokines characteristic for T cells and myeloid cells in the expected populations validated this methodology. Beyond the expected cytokine patterns, novel observations were made. Striking among these was the high expression of mRNA for RANKL in B cells from synovial fluid. This observation was validated at the protein level in synovial tissue and fluid.\nContext 3: Inflammatory cells from 12 RA patients were sorted into CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages and neutrophils. mRNA expression for 41 cytokines was determined by real-time PCR using microfluidic cards. Receptor activator nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) (TNFSF11) expression by B cells was further confirmed by flow cytometry and by immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections of synovial tissue from patients with RA.\nContext 4: Thirty-five patients (26%) developed arthritis within a median time of 11 months (interquartile range 3.7-18 mo). Circulating levels of cytokines, SPLA2, hsCRP, and PCT were not different between patients with progression to clinical arthritis and those without progression. However, a trend for IL-12p70, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-6, and SPLA2 was observed. No correlation between messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of inflammatory genes and progression to arthritis was found. Subgroup analysis of patients with early progression to arthritis showed higher levels of mRNA expression of poly(A)-specific ribonuclease and polycomb complex protein BMI-1 compared to patients without progression to arthritis.\nContext 5: The presence of disease-specific autoantibodies in RA but not spondyloarthritis (SpA) suggests that B-cell tolerance is preserved in the latter condition despite chronic joint inflammation. Which factors control B-cell tolerance vs autoimmunity in chronic arthritis remains incompletely understood. As single-cell mRNA expression profiling is a powerful tool to identify molecular signatures of disease, we investigated the expression of B-cell-specific genes in synovial fluid and peripheral blood of RA patients. We found that B cells from synovial fluid express mRNA for RANKL, a cytokine that is known to induce B-cell proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells. This observation was validated at the protein level in synovial tissue and fluid. In addition, we found that B cells from synovial fluid express mRNA for the B-cell-specific transcription factor Bcl-6. This observation was validated at the protein level in synovial tissue and fluid. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that B cells from synovial fluid express mRNA for RANKL", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Thirty treated periodontally compromised patients (PCP) and 30 PHP, with a total of 117 Straumann implants (PCP\u00a0=\u00a056, PHP\u00a0=\u00a061) were matched for age, gender, smoking and implant characteristics. The PCP group was further stratified with patients having at least one periodontal pocket \u22656\u00a0mm at follow-up examination allocated to a \"residual periodontitis\" (RP) group, while the remaining patients were assigned to a \"no residual periodontitis\" (NRP) group. These groups were compared with respect to probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and marginal bone loss.\nContext 2: The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the clinical outcomes of implant treatment in periodontally compromised and periodontally healthy patients (PHP), with a minimum follow-up period of 5\u00a0years.\nContext 3: Previously, we identified that the ATC/TTC haplotype formed by polymorphisms in the Interleukin-(IL)8 gene conferred susceptibility to chronic periodontitis (CP). The aim of the study was to investigate whether the IL8 haplotype ATC/TTC was associated with the volume of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), the concentration of interleukin IL-8 in the GCF, as well as periodontal conditions in patients with CP in comparison to controls without CP.\nContext 4: In studies 1 and 2, adult patients with periodontitis were randomized to receive SDD 10 mg qd, 20 mg qd, 20 mg bid, or placebo. In study 3, patients were randomized to receive SDD 20 mg bid or placebo. No medication was administered in study 4, a follow-up to study 3. Subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline (all studies) and at 12, 15 to 18, and 24 months (study 1); 12, 18, and 27 months (study 2); 3, 6, and 9 months (study 3); and 3 months post-study 3 (study 4). Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated bacteria was assessed by: 1) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels (studies 1 and 2); 2) cross-resistance to non-tetracycline antibiotics (studies 2 and 3); and 3) minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) levels (study 4).\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ATC/TTC haplotype formed by polymorphisms in the Interleukin-(IL)8 gene on the volume of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), the concentration of interleukin IL-8 in the GCF, as well as periodontal conditions in patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) in comparison to controls without CP.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the ATC/TTC haplotype formed by polymorphisms in the Interleukin-(IL)8 gene on the volume", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Altered arterial stiffness is a recognized risk factor of poor cardiovascular health. Chronic inflammation may increase arterial stiffness. We tested whether arterial stiffness is increased children with asthma, a chronic disease characterized by fluctuating airway and systemic inflammation. Arterial stiffness, expressed as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVcf), was measured in 37 mild-to-moderate asthmatic children: 11 girls, median (range) age 11.1\u00a0years (6-15). PWVcf in asthma was compared to PWVcf in 65 healthy controls matched for age, height, and gender previously studied in Germany and was correlated with airway inflammation and obstruction. PWVcf was higher in asthmatic children compared to controls: PWVcf median (interquartile range) was 4.7\u00a0m/s (4.5-4.9) vs. 4.3\u00a0m/s (4.1-4.7), p\u2009<\u20090.0001. In asthmatic children, PWVcf was inversely associated (r (2)\u2009=\u20090.20, p\u2009=\u20090.004) with forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV1). This association remained significant after adjusting for possible confounders including body mass index, blood pressure, steroid use, and FeNO.\nContext 2: Nineteen children with asthma aged 7 to 13 y.\nContext 3: Children with heightened airway responsiveness have a greater tendency to develop asthma symptoms. Many existing studies describing this relationship have relied on self-reported symptoms that may be prone to recall bias. In addition, few studies have examined the relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to indicators of asthma severity such as health-care utilization.\nContext 4: Three hundred thirteen children had full follow-up by age 7 years. In a multivariable analysis the total number of acute clinic visits for asthma symptom was significantly associated with later asthma (P<.0001), whereas the presence of wheeze at these visits was not (P=.5). The total number of acute clinic visits for significant troublesome lung symptoms was also significantly associated with later asthma in children who had never presented with any wheeze (P=.03).\nContext 5: This was a prospective, longitudinal study of 6306 children who were aged 10 to 11 years and whose families were interviewed every other year from birth onward. The study was designed to examine the association between asthma and the development of asthma symptoms and the development of asthma in children with asthma.\nContext 6: The study was conducted in the United States and included 6306 children who were aged 10 to 11 years and whose families were interviewed every other year from birth onward. The study was designed to examine the association between asthma and the development of asthma symptoms and the development of asthma in children with asthma.\nContext 7: The study was conducted in the United States and included 6306 children who were aged 10 to 11 years and whose families were interviewed every other year from birth onward. The study was designed to examine the association between asthma and the development of asthma symptoms and the development", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen for the gastrointestinal tract and also influences the number of new crypts formed by crypt fission. The time course of these events and possible linkage between these two complementary mechanisms is however poorly understood. We therefore examined the temporal relationship of proliferation and fission in rats treated with EGF.\nContext 2: In the small intestine, EGF significantly increased epithelial cell proliferation and crypt and villus area after 24 hours of EGF, although maximal effects were only reached following six days of infusion. EGF also resulted in an approximate 30% reduction in crypt fission in the small bowel. In the colon, EGF caused a twofold increase in epithelial cell proliferation one day after infusion, from 15.3 (2.3) to 29.6 (3.5) metaphases per crypt (p<0.01). Maximal effects were seen in rats receiving EGF for seven days. For all time points, colonic crypt size increased in response to EGF. The amount of branching increased following one day of infusion with EGF (from 15.3 (1.9) to 32.4 (5.5)%; p<0.001) but was significantly lower (approximately 25% of control values) following longer periods of infusion. Crypt fission did not correlate with crypt area.\nContext 3: While it is clear that luminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates repair of the damaged bowel, its significance in maintaining normal gut growth remains uncertain. If EGF is important in maintaining normal gut growth, the EGF receptor (EGF-R) should be present on the apical (luminal) surface in addition to the basolateral surface. AIMS/SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study examined the distribution of the EGF-R in the epithelium throughout the human gastro-intestinal tract using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and western blotting of brush border preparations.\nContext 4: Radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome is usually severe in clinical practice. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) plays an important role in the intestinal mucosal growth and repair of intestinal injury. This study was to investigate the effects of KGF on radiation-induced intestinal damage, especially the barrier dysfunction, in a mouse model.\nContext 5: Rats underwent jugular catheter placement and a 60% jejunoileal resection + 60% jejunoileal anastomosis. The rats were then randomized to receive either 0.1 mg/kg KGF or vehicle (saline) for 7 days. The rats were killed 7 days after surgery and the small intestine was harvested for histological analysis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of KGF on the intestinal barrier function in a rat model of radiation-induced intestinal injury.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of KGF on the intestinal barrier function in a rat model of radiation-induced intestinal injury.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of KGF on the intestinal barrier function in a rat model of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantation, certain recipient cytokine gene polymorphism genotypes and minor histocompatibility differences influence the occurrence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). The present study investigated the role of cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-10 gene polymorphisms HY, HA-1, and CD31 minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) mismatch in the development of aGvHD after unrelated cord blood (CB) transplant (CBT).\nContext 2: DNA samples of 115 CB recipients and their unrelated CB grafts were analyzed for genotype associated with TNF-alpha (TNFd3/d3) and IL-10 (IL-10(-1064), 11-16) and for disparities in major and three minor histocompatibility antigens, HY, HA-1, and CD31 codon 125. Results were correlated with the incidence of aGvHD grades II to IV.\nContext 3: Neither the donor nor the recipient GvHD risk alleles TNFd3/d3 and IL-10(-1064) (11-16) were associated with the development of aGvHD grades II to IV and I to IV. Because of the heterogeneity of CBTs, the data were reanalyzed separately for patients with malignancies (n=83) or with inborn errors (n=24). No significant association was observed between the severity of aGvHD and the possession of either TNFd3/d3 or IL-10 (11-16) genotypes. Mismatches for the mHags HY, HA-1, and CD31 exon 125 between donor and recipient did not associate with aGvHD grades II to IV.\nContext 4: Categorized by the median of cell doses infused, no G-PBMC cell dose significantly correlated with neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 24.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9-33.3) and was not significantly influenced by evaluated G-PBMC cell doses. With a median follow-up time of 18 months for surviving patients, estimates for extensive chronic GVHD was 43.8% (95% CI: 31.4-56.2), for freedom from progression was 78.3% (95% CI: 69.1-85.5), and for overall survival was 84.4% (95% CI: 78.1-89.7).\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that the TNF-alpha and IL-10 gene polymorphisms HY, HA-1, and CD31 minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) mismatch do not influence the development of aGvHD after CBT. The results also suggest that the cell dose infused does not influence the incidence of aGvHD after CBT.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that the TNF-alpha and IL-10 gene polymorphisms HY, HA-1", "Yes, obesity is associated with gonadal dysfunction in male survivors of childhood cancer.\nContext 1: Although obesity is associated with gonadal dysfunction in the general population, gonadotoxic treatment might diminish the impact of obesity in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). The aim was to evaluate whether altered body composition is associated with gonadal dysfunction in male CCS, independent of gonadotoxic cancer treatment.\nContext 2: Obesity is a risk factor for incident prostate cancer (PC) as well as risk of disease progression and mortality. We hypothesized that men diagnosed with lower-risk PC and who elected active surveillance (AS) for their cancer management", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Elderly hypertensive patients are characterized by blood pressure (BP) variability, impaired autonomic function, and vascular endothelial dysfunction and stiffness. However, the mechanisms causing these conditions are unclear. The present study examined the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\nContext 2: We recently reported that aldosterone-induced cellular senescence via an increase in p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, in rat kidney and cultured human proximal tubular cells. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of aldosterone to the renal p21 expression and senescence during the development of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced hypertension.\nContext 3: This study was designed to investigate the ability of a chronic blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors with losartan to reverse the endothelial dysfunction present in N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-treated hypertensive rats and the possible dependence of this effect on bradykinin B2-receptor activation.\nContext 4: We have demonstrated that short-term angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats produces cardiac changes that persist following cessation of treatment that result in a reduced inflammatory, proliferative and fibrotic response to the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(\u03c9) -Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The present study examines whether prior ACE inhibition with enalapril also protects against L-NAME-induced cardiac dysfunction.\nContext 5: Aging and hypertension in SHR additively caused the following: increased low frequency (LF) power of systolic BP, a decreased spontaneous baroreceptor reflex gain (sBRG), increased BP variability, increased urinary norepinephrine excretion, increased vascular senescence-related beta-galactosidase positive cells and oxidative stress. Treatment with olmesartan or valsartan significantly ameliorated these changes in aged SHR. However, olmesartan ameliorated these changes in aged SHR better than valsartan. The reductions in BP caused by olmesartan in aged SHR were sustained longer than reductions by valsartan. This result indicates longer-lasting inhibition of the AT1 receptor by olmesartan than by valsartan.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a rationale for your answer.\nYes, the study examined the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\nNo, the study examined the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\nMaybe, the study examined the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\nProvide a rationale for your answer.\nYes, the study examined the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).\nNo, the study examined the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SH", "Question: Is diabetes associated with an increased peri-operative mortality or non-infectious morbidity following lower extremity arterial reconstruction??\nExplanation: The aim of this study was to determine if, at a national level, diabetes mellitus is associated with worse perioperative outcomes after open lower extremity arterial reconstruction. Using Current Procedural Terminology codes, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to identify diabetic and nondiabetic patients who underwent open lower extremity arterial reconstruction from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2007. These 2 groups were then compared using bivariate and multivariate analyses. The effect of diabetes mellitus on the patency of peripheral vascular interventions was investigated in patients with arterial ins", "No, timely airway stenting does not improve survival in patients with malignant central airway obstruction.\nThe survival of patients with malignant central airway obstruction is very limited. Although airway stenting results in significant palliation of symptoms, data regarding improved survival after stenting for advanced thoracic cancer with central airway obstruction are lacking. Successful patency of the airway was achieved in all patients with no procedure-related mortality. Stenting resulted in significant improvement in MRC and ECOG performance scores (p < 0.01). Significantly improved survival was observed only in patients in the intermediate performance group compared with patients in the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To investigate the influence of location and size of acute insular infarct on stroke-related electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and cardiovascular events.\nContext 2: Large artery atherosclerosis was the main cause of acute insular infarct (71.8 %), which was associated with higher NIHSS score compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Comparing the left and right insular infarct, the frequencies of sinus bradycardia and sudden cardiac death were significantly higher in left insular infarct (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), while there was a trend that the frequency of atrial fibrillation was higher in right insular infarct (P = 0.079). With the larger size of insular infarct, the frequency of sinus bradycardia, new atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (P<0.01, P<0.05 and P<0.05, respectively) became much higher. Logistic regression analysis showed that major insular infarct was related to the higher frequency of sinus bradycardia (OR = 4.660, 95% CI: 1.646 ~ 13.195; P = 0.004).\nContext 3: Survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are at increased risk for arrhythmic events (AE), which include sudden death (SD) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (sVT). In the prethrombolytic era, abnormal parameters of depolarization and repolarization were considered to be markers of susceptibility to these events. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether these variables should still be considered predictors of AE in postinfarction patients with normal intraventricular conduction.\nContext 4: Heart rate \u226570 bpm was associated with increased relative risk for fatal or nonfatal MI (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.69, P=0.029). For every 5-bpm increase in heart rate, there was an increase in relative risk for fatal and nonfatal MI (11.3%, P=0.0002). Heart rate \u226570 bpm was also associated with increased relative risk for a composite of fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal or nonfatal MI, or other vascular death (excluding hemorrhagic death) (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03-1.69, P=0.029). For every 5-bpm increase in heart rate, there was an increase in relative risk for a composite of fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal or nonfatal MI, or other vascular death (excluding hemorrhagic death) (11.3%, P=0.0002).\nContext 5: The present study aimed to investigate the association between the severity of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and the risk of stroke in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nContext 6: The present study aimed to investigate the association between the severity of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction", "Question: Does metoclopramide attenuate cricoid pressure-induced relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter in awake volunteers??\nExplanation: The authors examined the influence of metoclopramide on cricoid pressure-induced relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in awake human volunteers. With local institutional review board approval, measurements of LES and intragastric pressures were made in 10 consenting volunteers before cricoid pressure application, during 15 s of cricoid pressure application, and after release of cricoid pressure. The measurements were repeated after 0.15 mg/kg intravenous metoclopramide. Cricoid pressure was applied by one investigator trained to consistently apply", "Question: Is extrathoracic staging necessary for non-small-cell lung cancer with clinical stage T1-2 N0??\nExplanation: The answer is no. The accuracy of FDG-PET scans for staging of lymph nodes is too low to replace invasive nodal staging. It is unknown whether the accuracy of integrated FDG-PET/CT scanning makes invasive staging redundant.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: A number of cytokines have been implicated in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure. Genetic polymorphisms of several cytokine genes are known to result in altered gene expression, enabling us to characterize patients as \"high\" or \"low\" producers of specific cytokines. We speculate that the cytokine genotypes for a population of children who underwent heart transplantation for end-stage ventricular failure due to cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease would be enriched for \"high producers\" of pro-inflammatory cytokines and \"low producers\" of anti-inflammatory cytokines.\nContext 2: Cytokine genotyping was performed for the following cytokines on 94 transplanted children using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific technique: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (-308), interleukin 10 (-1082, -819, -592), interleukin 6 (-174), transforming growth factor-beta1 (codons 10 & 25), and interferon-gamma (+874). Patients with ventricular failure after transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy, numbering 37, or for congenital heart disease, numbering 34, were compared to 15 children transplanted for structural disease, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, without ventricular failure, and to data from healthy children. An additional 8 children with restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were also studied.\nContext 3: Carvedilol is the standard of care for heart failure (HF) patients. Carvedilol is partially metabolized by the highly polymorphic enzyme, CYP2D6. To reach an effective dose while avoiding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), testing of CYP2D6 genotype prior to carvedilol initiation may be considered. The objectives of this study were to determine CYP2D6 metabolic genotypes in an Israeli cohort of HF patients and to investigate the relationship between genotype, carvedilol dose and number of ADRs to determine the importance of CYP2D6 genotyping prior to treatment initiation.\nContext 4: Increasing evidences have been obtained that immune activation and inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF). T helper (Th) 17 cells are a newly found pro-inflammatory T cell subtype. We therefore assessed the hypothesis that circulating Th17 cells increased in patients with CHF. Hypothesis. Th17 cells and its cytokine might be elevated in patients with CHF.\nContext 5: BNP has been shown to be a useful marker for the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and to predict the prognosis of patients with HF. However, the prognostic value of BNP in patients with HF is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of BNP in patients with HF.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of BNP in patients with HF.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of BNP in patients with HF.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of BNP in patients with HF.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was", "Contexts:\nContext 1: polypharmacy is an important risk factor for falls, but recent studies suggest only when including medications associated with increasing the risk of falls.\nContext 2: participants reported regular medication use at baseline. Any subsequent falls, any injurious falls and the number of falls were reported 2 years later. The association between polypharmacy (>4 medications) or fall risk-increasing medications and subsequent falls or injurious falls was assessed using modified Poisson regression. The association with the number of falls was assessed using negative binomial regression.\nContext 3: during follow-up, 231 falls per 1,000 person-years were reported. Polypharmacy including antidepressants was associated with a greater risk of any fall (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.54), of injurious falls (aRR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10-2.07) and a greater number of falls (adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) 1.60, 95% CI 1.19-2.15), but antidepressant use without polypharmacy and polypharmacy without antidepressants were not. The use of benzodiazepines was associated with injurious falls when coupled with polypharmacy (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04-1.87), but was associated with a greater number of falls (aIRR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05-1.65), independent of polypharmacy. Other medications assessed, including antihypertensives, diuretics and antipsychotics, were not associated with outcomes.\nContext 4: A total of 1172 patients were enrolled, mean age 73 (65-99), 74 % female, and 89 % Caucasian. Two hundred fifty-six (22 %) reported one or more falls within the last 6 months. Patients with at least one instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) or physical function deficit had more falls as compared those with no deficits identified (p \u2264 0.001). The number of daily medications, comorbidities, Timed Up and Go score >14 s, and poor vision were also associated with increased falls (p \u2264 0.001). Reduced physical function, poor vision, and low performance status had the highest adjusted odds ratio (3.6, 3.4, and 2.9, respectively) for falls. Polypharmacy was associated with a 1.5-fold increased risk of falls (p = 0.001). The risk of falls was higher in patients with polypharmacy (aRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9) and those with at least one IADL or physical function deficit (aRR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.2). The risk of falls was also higher in patients with poor vision (aRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.0) and those with a poor performance status (aRR 1.6,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor tigecycline on sporulation and toxin A and toxin B production were compared in historical (strain 9689) and hypervirulent BI/NAP1/027 (strain 5325) isolates of C. difficile in vitro.\nContext 2: Tigecycline at 1/4\u00d7 MIC stimulated an increased and earlier toxin A and/or B gene expression in both the historical and the hypervirulent strains, although a commensurate increase in toxin protein production was observed only in the 9689 strain. In fact, in the hypervirulent 5325 strain, toxin production was dramatically suppressed. By comparison, subinhibitory concentrations of vancomycin and metronidazole also stimulated increased protein toxin production by the historical, but not the hypervirulent, strain. In addition, tigecycline dose-dependently reduced viable spore production by both the 9689 and 5325 strains. Vancomycin treatment also suppressed spore formation in both C. difficile strains; however, metronidazole, while reducing spore formation in the 9689 strain, stimulated a near 2 log increase in spore production by the 5325 isolate.\nContext 3: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is mediated by potent extracellular toxins and is spread largely via bacterial spores. We and others have shown that some antibiotics stimulate C. difficile toxin production in a strain-specific manner; however, the effects of newer anti-C. difficile antibiotics on this process remain to be investigated.\nContext 4: The increased severity of disease associated with the NAP1 strain of Clostridium difficile has been attributed to mutations to the tcdC gene which codes for a negative regulator of toxin production. To assess the role of hyper-production of Toxins A and B in clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile, two NAP1-related and five NAP1 non-related strains were compared.\nContext 5: Data on the risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) associated with specific antibiotics are difficult to obtain because of confounding clinical factors. It is particularly important to evaluate the propensity of new antibiotics to induce CDI. We have examined the propensity of tigecycline to induce CDI using a human gut model.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\nYes, tigecycline is a new antibiotic that is effective against C. difficile.

Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a known entity with unknown cause, with the possibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias being one of the causes. However, no prior study has investigated epileptic survivors of sudden cardiac death (SCD), recurrent life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia (LTVA) and other outcomes in this patient population.\nContext 2: Ventricular arrhythmias are a frequent finding in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients and a cause of concern for physicians caring for them. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the importance of ventricular arrhythmias as predictors of sudden death in patients with CHF. This study examined the independent predictive value of ventricular arrhythmias for sudden death and all-cause mortality in PROMISE (Prospective Randomized Milrinone Survival Evaluation).\nContext 3: History of epilepsy (n = 6) was a significant predictor of recurrent LTVA [hazard ratio 3.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-9.56], cardiac death (hazard ratio 4.14, 95% CI 1.30-13.14) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 3.82, 95% CI 1.40-10.48) in the ICD arm (n = 498). This relationship remained unchanged on multivariate analysis after controlling for baseline clinical differences.\nContext 4: Survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are at increased risk for arrhythmic events (AE), which include sudden death (SD) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (sVT). In the prethrombolytic era, abnormal parameters of depolarization and repolarization were considered to be markers of susceptibility to these events. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether these variables should still be considered predictors of AE in postinfarction patients with normal intraventricular conduction.\nContext 5: Ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed and quantified by use of prespecified criteria on baseline ambulatory ECGs from 1080 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction </=35% enrolled in PROMISE. The relationship of ventricular arrhythmias to all-cause mortality was assessed by use of Cox proportional hazards regression.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to determine whether the presence of ventricular arrhythmias on baseline ambulatory ECGs is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The study population consisted of 1,000 patients with HF and LVEF </=40% enrolled in the PROMISE trial.\nContext 7: The present study was designed to determine whether the presence of ventricular arrhythmias on baseline ambulatory ECGs is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF", "Question: Are human leukocyte class I antigen alleles A2 and A11 associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in West Malaysia??\nExplanation: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles A2 and A11 are associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in West Malaysia.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used regression analyses to estimate the relationship between adiponectin and BMD in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors cohort of 441 men and 457 women aged 70 yr. The association was thereafter analyzed in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM), in which adiponectin was analyzed at age 70 yr and BMD at 82 yr in 507 men. Fractures in the ULSAM were documented in 314 men during 15 yr follow-up. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the risk of fracture according to serum adiponectin levels.\nContext 2: Recent evidence suggests that adiponectin may play a role in bone metabolism, but studies of the correlation between serum adiponectin and bone mineral density (BMD) have given conflicting results, and the impact on fracture risk is unknown.\nContext 3: In multivariable analysis a negative association between adiponectin and BMD was found in both cohorts. When individuals in the highest quintile of adiponectin were compared with those in the lowest quintile, adjusted BMD was 9.7% lower at the lumbar spine, 7.1% lower at the proximal femur, and 5.2% lower for total body in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (P < 0.001 for all three), and 8.1, 5.1, and 4.1% (P < 0.003 for all three), respectively, in the ULSAM. However, the hazard ratio for fracture per 1 sd of serum adiponectin was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.89-1.11).\nContext 4: Axial stiffness and maximal load were inversely associated with circulating adiponectin levels (R (2)\u2009=\u20090.44, p\u2009=\u20090.01; R (2)\u2009=\u20090.58, p\u2009=\u20090.05) after adjusting for injury duration and lower extremity lean mass. In individuals with post-SCI osteoporotic fractures, distal femur stiffness (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and maximal load (p\u2009=\u20090.04) were inversely associated with adiponectin levels.\nContext 5: In conclusion, adiponectin levels were inversely associated with BMD and fracture risk in both cohorts. The association was stronger in individuals with post-SCI osteoporotic fractures.", "Question: Is total plasma antioxidant capacity always decreased in sepsis??\nExplanation: Total plasma antioxidant capacity is decreased in sepsis. This is due to increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses. The decrease in total plasma antioxidant capacity is due to decreased glutathione levels and increased lipid peroxidation. The decrease in glutathione levels is due to increased oxidative stress and decreased glutathione synthesis. The increase in lipid peroxidation is due to increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses. The decrease in glutathione levels and increase in lipid peroxidation are due to increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses.", "Question: Is predialysis hypotension a predictor for mortality in long-term hemodialysis patients : insight from a single-center observational study??\nYes, predialysis hypotension is a predictor for mortality in long-term hemodialysis patients.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study.\nThe study was conducted in a single-center observational study", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Previous studies showed that the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) induce cardiomyocyte apoptoisis, leading to heart dysfunction. However, the effect of AGEs on another cell death pathway, autophagy, in cardiomyocytes remains unknown.\nContext 2: Rat neonate cardiomyocytes were cultured and treated with AGEs at different concentration. Two classic autophagy markers, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin-1, were detected by western blot assay. The inhibition of RAGE and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway were applied to cells, respectively.\nContext 3: AGEs administration enhanced the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 II in cardiomyocytes, increased the number of autophagic vacuoles and impaired the cell viability in dose-dependant manners. Also, AGEs inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway via RAGE. Inhibition of RAGE with RAGE antibody reduced expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 II/I and inhibited the cellular autophagy, accompanied by the reactivation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in cultured cells. Notably, the presence of inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway abolished the protective effect of RAGE inhibition on cardiomyocytes.\nContext 4: We found that oncogenic K-Ras cells predominantly extrude basally, rather than apically, in a cell-autonomous manner and can survive and proliferate after extrusion. Expression of K-Ras(V12) downregulates the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor S1P2, both of which are required for apical extrusion. Surprisingly, the S1P biosynthetic pathway is not affected because the S1P precursor, sphingosine kinase, and the degradative enzymes S1P lyase and S1PP phosphatase are not significantly altered. Instead, we found that high levels of autophagy in extruding Ras(V12) cells leads to S1P degradation. Disruption of autophagy chemically or genetically in K-Ras(V12) cells rescues S1P localization and apical extrusion.\nContext 5: To evaluate the role of AMPK in IMQ-induced apoptosis and autophagy.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n1. What is the role of autophagy in IMQ-induced apoptosis and autophagy?\n2. What is the role of AMPK in IMQ-induced apoptosis and autophagy?\n3.

While treatment with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma alone has weak antiviral action, HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer. Moreover, the presence of CDM for 2 h before IFN induction, during the 16 h induction period, only for 24 h after infection or during the complete IFN treatment period, reduces virus yields in an additive way without affecting IFN antiviral action.\nContext 2: Recent studies have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) synergizes with IFN-alpha/beta to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. Since IFN response represents an early host defense event against viral infection and the fact that treatment with meliacine, a plant antiviral, ameliorate the severity of the herpetic infection in female mice infected intravaginally with HSV-2, we wanted to investigate whether the administration of meliacine to HSV-2 infected mice could altered the homoestasis of IFNs host response. For this purpose we studied the effect of the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), which is the responsible for meliacine antiviral action, on the HSV-2 inhibition exerted by IFN alpha, IFN-gamma or their combination.\nContext 3: IFN-gamma caused a dose-dependent reduction (>50%) of HBV DNA in the absence of cytotoxicity. Although iNOS mRNA increased 45-fold in IFN-gamma treated cells, NO2- was not detectable in supernatants and the use of an NO-donor did not inhibit HBV replication. A3 enzyme mRNAs varied between cells and were >10-fold higher in lymphocytes than in liver tissue. IFN-gamma up-regulated A3G mRNA by three-fold, associated with significant HBV DNA decrease. However, A3G degradation by Vif did not abolish the antiviral effect of IFN-gamma against HBV.\nContext 4: IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma synergistically inhibit HSV-2 replication in Vero cells. While treatment with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma alone has weak antiviral action, HSV-2 plaque formation, viral replication and the onset of viral CPE in Vero cells are synergistically inhibited by interferon combination. In addition, CDM treatment contributes to protect cells from virus cytopathic effect and causes a strong inhibition of HSV-2 titer.

Among patients with AS, the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (64% v 40%, p < 0.001), smoking (43% v 27%, p < 0.001), diabetes (27% v 17%, p < 0.01), family history of CAD (30% v 21%, p </= 0.05), and male sex (65% v 44%, p < 0.001) was higher in those with than in those without CAD. The frequency of the major alleles was not different between cases and controls (APOE e2: 104 (19.3%) v 94 (17.5%); APOE e3: 319 (59.3%) v 332 (61.9%); APOE e4: 115 (21.3%) v 110 (20.5%); all p > 0.10).\nContext 3: Patients with AS (n = 538) and a control group of the same age without heart disease (n = 536) were recruited. Left heart catheterisation was performed and mean gradient, aortic valve area, presence of stenotic coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiovascular risk factors (hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus and family history of CAD) were assessed. The frequency of the APOE major alleles e2, e3 and e4 was assessed by genotyping the polymorphisms APOE334 and APOE472 with a 5' exonuclease assay (TaqMan).\nContext 4: No association was observed between the APOE epsilon4 allele and clinical characteristics of our study population. We also investigated the -491 A/T APOE promoter polymorphism in 236 MS subjects and did not find any association between the -491 A/T polymorphism and the selected clinical variables.\nContext 5: Smoking is a risk factor for increased carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pulmonary administration of TiO\u2082 or CB NPs in rats could induce and/or aggravate elastase-induced emphysema, and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nContext 2: Increasing environmental and occupational exposures to nanoparticles (NPs) warrant deeper insight into the toxicological mechanisms induced by these materials. The present study was designed to characterize the cell death induced by carbon black (CB) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs in bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o- cell line and primary cells) and to investigate the implicated molecular pathways.\nContext 3: TiO\u2082 NPs per se did not modify the parameters investigated, but CB NPs increased perivascular/peribronchial infiltration, and macrophage MMP-12 expression, without inducing emphysema. Elastase administration increased BAL cellularity, histological inflammation, HO-1, IL-1\u03b2 and macrophage MMP-12 expression and induced emphysema. Exposure to TiO\u2082 NPs did not modify pulmonary responses to elastase, but exposure to CB NPs aggravated elastase-induced histological inflammation without aggravating emphysema.\nContext 4: In light of recent developments in nanotechnologies, interest is growing to better comprehend the interaction of nanoparticles with body tissues, in particular within the cardiovascular system. Attention has recently focused on the link between environmental pollution and cardiovascular diseases. Nanoparticles <50 nm in size are known to pass the alveolar-pulmonary barrier, enter into bloodstream and induce inflammation, but the direct pathogenic mechanisms still need to be evaluated. We thus focused our attention on titanium dioxide (TiO\u2082) nanoparticles, the most diffuse nanomaterial in polluted environments and one generally considered inert for the human body.\nContext 5: C57BL/6 male mice were intratracheally instilled with 300 \u00b5g ultrafine carbon black (ufCB; 14\u2009nm in diameter), and sacrificed at 1, 3, 7 and 14 d post-exposure. Differential cell counts, elastase activities, and desmosine and hydroxyproline in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid were determined. Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis determined the cell origin of the elastase activity. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) was determined by Western blotting. The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 was determined by ELISA. The expression of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was determined by Western blotting. The expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin was determined by immunofluorescent staining. The expression of the cell adhesion molecule CD44 was determined by immunofluorescent staining.

The first group received 1550-nm laser combined with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment, and the second group received 1550-nm laser alone. The primary outcome was the incidence and degree of corneal neovascularization developing after penetrating keratoplasty. The study was conducted in 2", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The endothelin (ET) system is activated in failing hearts. Congestive heart failure frequently is associated with ventricular arrhythmias, which may result from electrical remodeling such as changes of ionic current density and heterogeneous action potential prolongation. We examined the effects of long-term ET(A) receptor blockade on the electrophysiological properties of ventricular cells, the surface ECG, and the survival in BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters.\nContext 2: Membrane currents and action potentials were recorded from left ventricular cells isolated from normal F1beta hamsters and cardiomyopathic BIO 14.6 hamsters untreated and chronically treated with TA-0201, an ET(A) receptor antagonist. In ventricular cells of untreated BIO 14.6 hamsters, the action potential duration was prolonged and the densities of the L-type Ca2+ current (I(Ca,L)), the transient outward current (I(to)), the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(K)), and the inward rectifier K+ current (I(K1)) were decreased compared with those of F1beta hamsters. Long-term treatment with the ET(A) receptor antagonist significantly attenuated action potential duration prolongation and reduction of I(to), I(K), and I(Ca,L) in BIO 14.6 ventricular cells. Long-term ET(A) receptor blockade prevented the QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias and improved the survival rate in the cardiomyopathic hamsters.\nContext 3: Endothelin (ET) and natriuretic peptides have prognostic significance in chronic heart failure (CHF). Because stimuli for forming these neurohormones differ, this study investigates whether their prognostic power depends on clinical stage and on length of the observation period.\nContext 4: Endothelin (ET) receptor antagonists have been reported to reduce both infarct size and no-reflow phenomenon; however, in rat models their effect on the healing process after myocardial infarction (MI) is controversial. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of early administration of the ET(A) receptor antagonist darusentan on scar healing in an ischemia-reperfusion model in dogs.\nContext 5: The role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm is not well understood.

Before, during, and 1 h after flumazenil infusion, we measured cortical motor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This included resting motor threshold (rMT), paired-pulse measurements of intracortical inhibition and facilitation (ICI and ICF), recruitment curve (RC), and silent period (SP). We also measured F response and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) with peripheral nerve stimulation. The study was carried out using a randomized, double-blind crossover design controlled with a saline infusion.\nContext 2: The motor cortex may be subject to tonic inhibitory drive. One inhibitory mechanism is supported by activity at benzodiazepine (BZP) receptors. In this study we investigate whether or not the BZP antagonist, flumazenil, increases cortical motor excitability in humans.\nContext 3: Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (ICF), and input-output curves (IO curves) were investigated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Recordings were made from the resting right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in 10 healthy subjects on three occasions: 9A.M. and 4P.M. of the same day, and 9A.M. of the following day.\nContext 4: An adaptive paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol stimulating the dominant hand motor area was used to measure resting motor threshold (rMT), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF) and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) before, during, and after 40 min of 120 Hz bilateral external continuous trigeminal nerve stimulation. Neuronavigation was used for guidance.\nContext 5: Two clinically similar groups of PD patients, one consisting of drug-na\u00efve patients and another of patients already on chronic dopaminergic medication (when off medication), were compared to each other and to a control group. Plasticity and excitability of the hand primary motor cortex of the more affected side were evaluated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short answer (1-2 sentences) and a reference to the article.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a hif-1 loss-of-function mutation confers resistance towards the mitochondrial toxin ethidium bromide (EtBr) and suppresses EtBr-induced production of ROS. In mammals, the PD-related gene DJ-1 is known to act as a redox sensor to confer protection against antioxidants and mitochondrial inhibitors. A deletion mutant of the C. elegans homolog djr-1.1 also showed increased resistance to EtBr. Furthermore, our data implicates p38 MAP kinase as an indispensable factor for survival against mitochondrial stress in both hif-1 and djr-1.1\u00a0mutants.\nContext 2: Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the leading causes of neurological disorders in humans. Mitochondrial perturbations lead to adaptive mechanisms that include HIF-1 stabilization, though the consequences of increased levels of HIF-1 following mitochondrial stress remain poorly understood.\nContext 3: Maternal or uniparental inheritance (UPI) of mitochondria is generally observed in sexual eukaryotes, however, the underlying mechanisms are diverse and largely unknown. Recently, based on the use of mutants blocked in autophagy, it has been demonstrated that autophagy is required for strict maternal inheritance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Uniparental mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance has been well documented for numerous fungal species, and in particular, has been shown to be genetically governed by the mating-type loci in the isogamous species Cryptococcus neoformans, Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Ustilago maydis. Previously, we have shown that the a2 mating-type locus gene lga2 is decisive for UPI during sexual development of U. maydis. In axenic culture, conditional overexpression of lga2 triggers efficient loss of mtDNA as well as mitophagy. To assess a functional relationship, we have investigated UPI in U. maydis \u0394atg11 mutants, which are blocked in mitophagy.\nContext 4: The maintenance of cell metabolism and homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living organisms. In eukaryotes, mitochondria are the cornerstone of these life supporting processes, playing leading roles in a host of core cellular functions, including energy transduction, metabolic and calcium signalling, and supporting roles in a number of biosynthetic pathways. The possession of a discrete mitochondrial genome dictates that mitochondria are the only organelles that are not inherited by the daughter cells of a cell division. The maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is therefore a fundamental requirement for the survival of the cell. In this study, we have investigated the role of the mitochondrial DNA maintenance protein, DnaJ, in the maintenance of mtDNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nContext 5: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the only genome that is not inherited by the daughter cells of a cell division.

We analysed the risk of reactivation of lymphotropic herpesviruses in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis treated with an anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) agent (infliximab).\nContext 2: We previously demonstrated that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a 10-fold systemic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) overload, very similar to that observed in healthy organ transplant recipients. Our objective was to monitor EBV load over time in patients with RA receiving methotrexate, infliximab, or etanercept to detect possible immunosuppression-associated EBV dysregulation, as described in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease.\nContext 3: Forty-seven patients with various diagnoses, who had had a PPD test before infliximab use, were retested after infliximab treatment. The test was also assessed cross-sectionally among 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after 8.6 [+/- 4.1 standard deviation (SD)] months of infliximab use and in 82 patients with RA who had never used this agent. Booster phenomenon and the interobserver variability of reading the test were reassessed among 163 infliximab-naive patients with RA and Behcet's disease (BD) and 47 healthy controls.\nContext 4: 43 patients with rheumatoid arthritis not responding to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) received intravenous infliximab at a dose of 3 mg/kg at baseline and after two and six weeks, and subsequently bimonthly, in combination with methotrexate. Serum samples were collected at baseline and at week 24. A commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to test for anti-CCP antibodies; RF were detected using a quantitative nephelometric assay.\nContext 5: Aberrant, extranuclear HMGB1 and constitutive nuclear HMGB1 expression, with histological signs of inflammation, were evident in all biopsies obtained before infliximab therapy. Signs of inflammation were still evident in the second biopsies obtained nine weeks after initiation of infliximab therapy. The cytoplasmic and extracellular expression of HMGB1 decreased in five patients, remained unchanged in one patient and increased in one patient. The expression of HMGB1 was not related to the presence of anti-CCP antibodies or RF.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that the reactivation of lymphotropic herpesviruses in patients with RA treated with infliximab is related to the intensity of immunosuppression. The reactivation of EBV in patients with RA receiving infliximab is not related to the intensity of immunosuppression. The reactivation of EBV in patients with RA receiving infliximab is not related to the intensity of immunosuppression. The reactivation of EBV in patients with RA receiving infliximab is not related to the intensity of immunosuppression.

It is also recognised as the most frequent genetic cause of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). In the present study, four tagging SNPs and two more well studied polymorphisms (Intron 4 VNTR and Glu298Asp) the NOS3 gene were investigated to unravel the potential modifier effect of NOS3 gene on the progression of CKD", "No, it does not.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of the serotonergic system in the antidepressant-like activity of MTEP in the tail suspension test (TST) in C57BL/6J mice, using selected antagonists of serotonergic receptors and by applying two different methods of serotonin (5-HT) depletion.\nContext 2: Numerous studies indicate the potential antidepressant actions of several mGlu5 receptor antagonists, including 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP). The explanation for the mechanism of these effects might be a key step in finding new antidepressant drugs (AD).\nContext 3: The results of our studies showed that the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, MTEP, similar to the fluoxetine used as reference AD, did not induce antidepressant-like effects in mice pretreated with tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, parachlorophenylalanine. On the other hand, MTEP worked as a potential AD in the TST in mice fed on a tryptophan-free (TRP-free) diet for 3 weeks. However, fluoxetine, which was used as a reference control was also active in this experiment, suggesting that a TRP-free diet was not sufficiently effective in reducing the 5-HT level. Furthermore, we showed that the 5HT2A/2C antagonist, ritanserin, yet not the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635, 5HT1B antagonist, SB224289 or 5HT4 antagonist, GR125487, reversed the antidepressant-like effects of MTEP in the TST. Finally, a sub-effective dose ofMTEP coadministered with a sub-effective dose of citalopram induced an antidepressant-like effect in the TST in mice.\nContext 4: Numerous studies suggest agents that act on glutamatergic transmission as potential antidepressants. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that magnesium, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blocker, may be useful in the treatment of depression.\nContext 5: Chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration to rodents desensitizes or downregulates raphe 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptors. We previously found elevated 5-HT1A binding in antidepressant-treated rats. We hypothesized that chronic SSRI administration would desensitize 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei of mice. We found that chronic administration of fluoxetine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks desensitized 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei of mice. The desensitization was reversed by chronic administration of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Chronic administration of fluoxetine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks also desensitized 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei of rats. The desensitization was reversed by chronic", "Contexts:\nContext 1: During atherogenesis, macrophages migrate into the subendothelial space where they ingest deposited lipoproteins, accumulate lipids, and transform into foam cells. It is unclear why these macrophages do not remove their lipid loads from the region. This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that macrophage behavior is altered when membrane cholesterol levels are elevated, as might be the case for cells in contact with lipoproteins within atherosclerotic lesions.\nContext 2: We examined the effects of elevating membrane cholesterol on macrophage behavior. J774 macrophages were treated with either acetylated low-density lipoprotein (ac-LDL) and ACAT inhibitor or cholesterol-chelated methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (chol-MbetaCD) to increase membrane cholesterol levels. Our results show that elevating the membrane cholesterol of J774 macrophages induced dramatic ruffling, stimulated cell spreading, and affected F-actin organization. Cellular adhesion was required for these effects, and Rac-mediated signaling pathways were involved. Additionally, 3-dimensional transwell chemotaxis assays showed that migration of J774 macrophages was significantly inhibited when membrane cholesterol levels were raised.\nContext 3: To assess the role of apolipoprotein (apo) E in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in vivo.\nContext 4: ApoE exerts an antiatherosclerotic activity by regulating lipoprotein metabolism and promoting cell cholesterol efflux. We discriminated between macrophage and systemic apoE contribution using an assay of macrophage RCT in mice. The complete absence of apoE lead to an overall impairment of the process and, similarly, the absence of apoE exclusively in macrophages resulted in the reduction of cholesterol mobilization from macrophages to plasma, liver, and feces. Conversely, expression of apoE in macrophages is sufficient to promote normal RCT even in apoE-deficient mice. The mechanisms accounting for these results were investigated by evaluating the first step of RCT (ie, cholesterol efflux from cells). Macrophages isolated from apoE-deficient mice showed a reduced ability to release cholesterol into the culture medium, whereas the apoB-depleted plasma from apoE-deficient and healthy mice possessed a similar capacity to promote cellular lipid release from cultured macrophages.\nContext 5: Macrophages are crucial cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Macrophages are the main source of cholesterol efflux from macrophages to the plasma. The present study was designed to investigate the role of the cholesterol efflux receptor, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), in macrophage cholesterol efflux. SR-BI-deficient mice were generated and compared with wild-type mice. The results showed that SR-BI-deficient mice had a significantly lower plasma cholesterol level and a lower plasma cholesterol efflux capacity than wild-type mice. The cholesterol efflux capacity of SR-BI-deficient macrophages was significantly lower than that of wild-type macrophages. The cholesterol efflux capacity of SR-BI-deficient macrophages was significantly lower than that of wild-type macrophages. The cholesterol", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We enrolled seven postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes and ten age-matched healthy women as controls in a placebo-controlled study to evaluate the acute metabolic effects of tadalafil. We performed microdialysis and blood flow measurements in muscle, and sampled arterial and deep venous blood before and after a single dose of tadalafil 20 mg or placebo. Circulating glucose and insulin levels, muscle capillary recruitment as reflected by permeability surface area for glucose (PS(glu)) and forearm glucose uptake were measured.\nContext 2: In women with type 2 diabetes, but not in the control group, tadalafil induced increases in the incremental AUC for PS(glu) (tadalafil vs placebo 41 +/- 11 vs 4 +/- 2 ml [100 g](-1) min(-1), p < 0.05) and forearm glucose uptake (46 +/- 9 vs 8 +/- 4 micromol [100 g](-1) min(-1), p < 0.05). The variable that best predicted forearm glucose uptake was PS(glu), which explained 70% of its variance. However, fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were similar following treatment with placebo or tadalafil in the two groups.\nContext 3: Recent evidence suggests that reduced synthesis of nitric oxide in endothelial cells, i.e. endothelial dysfunction, contributes to the impaired action of insulin in the vasculature of patients with type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether selective inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 by tadalafil has beneficial effects on peripheral microcirculation and glucose uptake in these patients.\nContext 4: Insulin has nitric-oxide-dependent vasodilatory effects in muscle, including capillary recruitment, that enhance access for itself and glucose. However, nitric-oxide-dependent vasodilators other than methacholine do not enhance insulin action. Our hypothesis is that methacholine, unlike bradykinin, enhances insulin-mediated glucose uptake in muscle by augmenting capillary recruitment.\nContext 5: Exercise and insulin each increase microvascular blood flow and enhance glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. We have reported that insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment in a diet-induced model of insulin resistance (high-fat feeding for 4 weeks) is markedly impaired; however, the effect of muscle contraction in this model has not been previously explored.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n\nContext 1: We enrolled seven postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes and ten age-matched healthy women as controls in a placebo-controlled study to evaluate the acute metabolic effects of tadalafil.

Preterm females also had lower height (p\u2009=\u20090.00) and waist-hip circumference ratio (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Preterm males had lower cesarean delivery (p\u2009=\u20090.05) and greater family history of cardiovascular disease (p\u2009=\u20090.05). Although the differences on clinical or laboratorial measurements were small and non-significant for cardiovascular risk factors, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) tended to be higher in preterm groups, especially for females (SBP\u2009=\u20094.1\u2009mmHg and DBP\u2009=\u20091.6\u2009mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.12 and p\u2009=\u20090.38, respectively).\nContext 3: In 2005, 12.7% of all babies were born preterm, and the incidence is rising. Nowadays, due to improved survival, an increasing number of children born preterm reach young adulthood. A recent report suggested lower insulin sensitivity in children born preterm, which may put them at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. It is, however, still unknown whether this reduced insulin sensitivity persists into adulthood.\nContext 4: Children with a history of preterm birth walked later than children born at term (12.4 +/- 0.5 versus 10.9 +/- 0.2 months; P =.004); however, gestation-corrected walking age (11.4 +/- 0.5 for children born preterm) did not differ. In multiple regression analysis, boys born preterm had larger periosteal and endosteal circumferences and smaller cortical thickness and area than boys born term (least square means, 49.7 +/- 1.3 mm, 43.0 +/- 1.8 mm, 1.1 +/- 0.11 mm, and 49.3 +/- 3.2 mm2 versus 47.0 +/- 0.5 mm, 38.5 +/- 0.7 mm, 1.4 +/- 0.04 mm, and 48.7 +/- 2.9 mm2, respectively; P <.001 for all comparisons). Girls born preterm had larger periosteal and endosteal circumferences and smaller cortical thickness and area than girls born term (least square means, 49.7 +/- 1.3 mm, 43.0 +/- 1.8 mm, 1.1 +/- 0.11 mm, and 49.3 +/- 3.2 mm2 versus 47.0 +/- 0.5 mm, 38.5 +/- 0.7 mm, 1.4 +/- 0.04 mm, and 48.7 +/- 2.9 mm2, respectively; P <.001 for", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Interleukin-33 (IL-33) and soluble ST2 (sST2) have been demonstrated to be involved in liver injury. The present study aims to evaluate serum IL-33 and sST2 level in acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) and determine their predictive value for prognosis.\nContext 2: Patients with both SS-A and SS-B autoantibodies were included if stored serum samples and medical records were available. No patients had clinically apparent chronic liver disease, and no patients had cryoglobulinemia. Six patients (group 1) had abnormally high aminotransferase values on one or more occasion, a history of acute hepatitis, or blood product exposure through transfusion or intravenous drug use. In 18 cases (group 2) no liver disease could be established, but there was insufficient information to exclude it. The 24 remaining patients (group 3) had no risk factors for liver disease, no known history of acute or chronic liver disease, a normal physical examination for signs of chronic hepatitis, and repeatedly normal aminotransferase values. Antibody to hepatitis C virus was determined by RIBA-2 (Chiron Corp, Emeryville, CA). The samples were tested for hepatitis C virus RNA after polymerase chain reaction amplification.\nContext 3: This study was designed to investigate the association between serum ferritin concentration (SF) and hepatitis B virus infected patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF). In addition, we analyzed whether SF levels are associated with mortality in AoCLF patients.\nContext 4: Hepatitis B virus infection is the most frequent cause of fulminant hepatic failure. Recently, systemic inflammatory response syndrome has been reported to be important in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. However, prognostic factors for fulminant hepatitis B have not been fully examined. In this study, we analyzed prognostic factors for fulminant hepatitis B in order to accurately identify patients with fatal outcomes.\nContext 5: There were 24 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 4 HBeAg-negative patients within the original 28 AdLF-CHB patients. At the end of 10 years lamivudine treatment, 20 of the 24 HBeAg-positive patients had HBeAg loss. HBeAg seroconversion was detected in 10 of these 20 HBeAg-positive patients. The HBeAg-positive patients with HBeAg seroconversion had a significantly lower incidence of liver failure than the HBeAg-negative patients (P = 0.001). The HBeAg-positive patients with HBeAg seroconversion had a significantly lower incidence of liver failure than the HBeAg-negative patients (P = 0.001). The HBeAg-positive patients with HBeAg seroconversion had a significantly lower incidence of liver failure than the HBeAg-negative patients (P = 0.001).

The selectin family plays a key role initiating the cascade of events. Recently, we have demonstrated the functional relevance of a variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism affecting the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1). Neutrophils carrying short alleles exhibit a significantly lower capacity to bind activated platelets. These alleles consistently protect against transient ischemic attack. We sought to evaluate the role of this polymorphism in premature myocardial infarction because genetic risk factors have more relevance in the development of disease in young patients.\nContext 2: P-selectin (PSEL) and its ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), play key roles in both the inflammatory response and the atherosclerotic process, but there are conflicting results regarding the affect of PSEL and PSGL-1 gene variation on risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. We tested the association of four PSEL and two PSGL-1 polymorphisms with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke among 13,875 participants in the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We also tested common haplotypes in the PSEL and PSGL-1 genes to assess associations with incident CHD and ischemic stroke.\nContext 3: A Thr>Pro polymorphism at codon 715 in the coding region of the P-selectin gene has recently been described. Individuals carrying the Pro715 allele were reported to have a reduced risk of myocardial infarction. A possible association of this polymorphism with the risk of ischemic stroke is currently under discussion.\nContext 4: P-selectin mediates leukocyte recruitment to activated platelets and endothelium through its high-affinity receptor P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Platelet and leukocyte activation and binding have been reported after coronary angioplasty and were correlated with restenosis. We investigated the effect of a recombinant soluble PSGL-1 (rPSGL-Ig) on the adhesion of platelets and neutrophils and the development of restenosis after double arterial injury.\nContext 5: The 4G allele of the 4G/5G polymorphism in the promoter of the P-selectin gene is associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction. The 4G allele has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke. We investigated the association of the 4G/5G polymorphism in the promoter of the P-selectin gene with the risk of ischemic stroke in a large population-based cohort.\nContext 6: The 4G/5G polymorphism in the promoter of the P-selectin gene is associated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction.

We have previously shown a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in girls. This study investigated whether the musculo-skeletal response to Vitamin D was modulated by polymorphisms in VDR gene.\nContext", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study evaluated the role of clinical rescreening of family members at risk for familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDC).\nContext 2: Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetic cardiomyopathy that usually is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern and may underlie from one-quarter to one-half of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) diagnoses. Thus, FDC may present with advanced heart failure (HF) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Because FDC may respond to medical intervention, we have previously recommended that screening of first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) of patients diagnosed with IDC be undertaken to rule out FDC, and that with a diagnosis of FDC in the kindred, unaffected but at-risk family members be rescreened every three to five years. METHODS; Follow-up screening (history, examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiography) of a large family with FDC was performed six years after initial screening. Of 68 family members who underwent rescreening, two (one with left ventricular enlargement only, one with a left bundle branch block) presented with advanced HF and SCD, respectively. Two additional subjects, asymptomatic at initial screening, were also affected with FDC at follow-up.\nContext 3: Forty-five patients (23%) from 38 families (35%) were diagnosed with an inheritable cause of sudden death. Eighteen had potentially prognostically important medication commenced and 4 had an ICD inserted on clinic recommendation (2 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1 dilated cardiomyopathy, 1 arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy). Two other individuals had ICDs removed after negative testing for familial RYR2 mutations. No deaths have occurred during follow-up to date.\nContext 4: Following national guidance on management of sudden unexplained death (SUD) in the young, inherited cardiac conditions (ICC) clinics were established to identify and treat relatives thought to be at increased risk. Studies have examined diagnostic yield of these clinics but outcome of clinical management has not been reported.\nContext 5: Patients with unrelated AAA diagnosed at the Cardiovascular Surgery Department, University Hospital of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, between 1999 and 2012 were invited to the study. A detailed family history was obtained in interviews and recorded using Progeny software. We divided the 618 patients into 2 study groups: group I, 296 patients with AAA (268; 90%) with a family history of AAA, and group II, 322 patients with AAA (282; 88%) without a family history of AAA. The study was approved by the local ethics committee.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDC) in a large cohort of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to determine the prevalence of FDC in patients with DCM who were not screened for FDC.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDC) in a large cohort of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and to determine the prevalence", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Viral myocarditis, which is often caused by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), is a serious clinical disorder characterized by excessive myocardial inflammation. Valproic acid (VPA) is described as a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory effects in several inflammatory diseases. However, the role and the detailed mechanism of VPA in viral myocarditis remain unclear.\nContext 2: Administration of VPA significantly attenuated the clinical severity of myocarditis, and the overall mortality from CVB3-induced myocarditis. The infiltration of Th17 and Treg cells, as well as the serum level of related cytokines (IL-17A and IL-10), were increased in CVB3 infected mice. In addition, VPA decreased the percentage of splenic Th17 cells while increased the percentage of Treg cells. Moreover, VPA downregulated the expression of IL-17A and upregulated IL-10 in serum and heart tissues of CVB3 infected mice. Additionally, VPA directly inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells and promoted both the differentiation and suppressive function of Treg cells in vitro and in vivo.\nContext 3: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) causes human myocarditis, which can result in cardiac damage, maladaptive remodeling, and heart failure. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-8 and -9 have been identified in virus-infected myocardium, but their particular roles and underlying mechanisms of effect are unknown. For the first time, we examine the severity of CVB3-induced myocarditis in MMP-8-and MMP-9-deficient mice.\nContext 4: Therefore, mortality, cardiac inflammation, and function were assessed in TSP-2-null (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice in human Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis. TSP-2 KO had an increased mortality when compared with WT mice during viral myocarditis. The absence of TSP-2 resulted in increased cardiac inflammation and injury at 14 days, which resulted in depressed systolic function [fractional shortening (FS); 34 \u00b1 2.6 in WT vs. 24 \u00b1 1.8 in KO mice, P< 0.05] and increased cardiac dilatation (end-diastolic dimensions, mm; 3.7 \u00b1 0.09 in WT vs. 4.8 \u00b1 0.06 in KO mice, P< 0.05) at 28 days. TSP-2 KO mice had increased cardiac inflammation and injury at 14 days, which resulted in depressed systolic function [FS; 34 \u00b1 2.6 in WT vs. 24 \u00b1 1.8 in KO mice, P< 0.05] and increased cardiac dilatation (end-diastolic dimensions, mm; 3.7 \u00b1 0.09 in WT vs. 4.8 \u00b1 0.06 in KO mice, P< 0.05) at 28 days.

Although previous research has suggested that the transradial approach is associated with lower risk of adverse outcomes following PCI, it is not widely used in the United States. This retrospective propensity-matched study investigated the impact of prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on short-term and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). In a prospective, multicenter study, pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) coronary occlusion was defined by an i-TIM", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex condition characterized by different phenotypes, according to the combinations of risk factors and is associated with cardiovascular abnormalities. Whether control of MetS components by treatment produces improvement in the associated cardiovascular abnormalities is unknown. We investigated whether partial control of components of MetS was associated with less echocardiographic abnormalities than the complete presentation of MetS based on measured components.\nContext 2: We evaluated markers of echocardiographic preclinical cardiovascular disease in MetS (ATP III) defined by measured components or by history of treatment, in 1421 African-American and 1195 Caucasian non-diabetic HyperGEN participants, without prevalent cardiovascular disease or serum creatinine >2 mg/dL. Of 2616 subjects, 512 subjects had MetS by measured components and 328 by history. Hypertension was found in 16% of participants without MetS, 6% of those with MetS by history and 42% of those with MetS by measured components. Obesity and central fat distribution had similar prevalence in both MetS groups (both p < 0.0001 vs. No-MetS). Blood pressure was similar in MetS by history and No-MetS, and lower than in MetS by measured components (p < 0.0001). LV mass and midwall shortening, left atrial (LA) dimension and LA systolic force were similarly abnormal in both MetS groups (all p < 0.0001 vs. No-MetS) without difference between them.\nContext 3: Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in the general population. Its prognostic implications are less well defined in patients with coronary artery disease.\nContext 4: Patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have potentially higher risk for cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MetS on cardiac events in type-2 diabetic patients asymptomatic for coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Japanese population.\nContext 5: Echocardiography was performed on 7 mo old C57BL/6 wild-type mice (WT) and ob/ob mice fed ad libitum, leptin-repleted (LR-ob/ob), or calorie-restricted (CR-ob/ob) for 4 wk. Ventricular tissue was examined by electron microscopy (EM), triglyceride (TAG) content, oil red O staining, mitochondrial coupling assay, and microarray analysis. The results were compared with those of WT mice fed ad libitum.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leptin on cardiac function in a mouse model of obesity.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leptin on cardiac function in a mouse model of obesity.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leptin on cardiac function in a mouse model of obesity.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leptin on cardiac function in a mouse model of obesity.\nContext 10: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of leptin on cardiac function in a mouse model of", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The study results in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are contradicting as to whether RBV concentration correlates with sustained virological response (SVR).

The main purpose of this study was to compare the maximal knee flexion one year after surgery in patients who received either the bicruciate substituting knee system or the conventional posterior stabilized system.\nContext 2: Constrained primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can provide stability in the face of incompetent collateral structures or irreconcilable flexion-extension imbalances. However, little is known about its effect on overall knee range of motion (ROM). This study determines whether TKA with increased constraint affects postoperative ROM.\nContext 3: In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 124 patients presenting with osteoarthritis received the bicruciate substituting or the conventional posterior stabilized prosthesis. The primary outcome was the maximum flexion angle at one year postoperatively on a lateral radiograph made with the supine patient using manual force to bend the knee. Secondary outcomes were active flexion (lying and standing), the Knee Society Score, the Patella Scoring System score, the University of California Los Angeles score, the number and type of adverse device effects, and visual analog scale satisfaction up to two years postoperatively. The outcome measures of both groups were compared using one-sided t tests and non-parametric alternatives, with a significance level of p < 0.05.\nContext 4: Preoperative range of motion (ROM) has been regarded as one of the most important factors in predicting postoperative ROM following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Mobile-bearing TKA designs have been suggested to possibly improve the knee kinematics compared to fixed-bearing designs. The purpose of this study was to examine the difference in postoperative flexion as a function of preoperative flexion in a consecutive series of TKAs done using a posterior-stabilized rotating-platform prosthesis.\nContext 5: Shorter stance time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and less peak knee flexion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at weight bearing acceptance was found in the prosthetic side compared with the contralateral side. Larger knee (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and hip (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) adduction was found compared with healthy controls. Neither asymmetries between the prosthetic and the contralateral side nor differences compared with healthy controls were enhanced when walking on compliant surfaces compared with hard surfaces.\n\nBased on the contexts above, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n1. The bicruciate substituting knee system provides better postoperative flexion than the conventional posterior stabilized knee system.\n2. The bicruciate substituting knee system provides better postoperative flexion than the conventional posterior stabilized knee system.\n3. The bicruciate substituting knee system provides better postoperative flexion than the conventional posterior stabilized knee system.\n4.

Twenty-three young male volunteers were studied on 2 different days 1-3 weeks apart. On each experimental day the forearm skin blood flow response to iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (Ach, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator) was determined with laser Doppler imaging following the intravenous administration of either the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor lysine acetylsalicylate (L-AS), 900 mg, or the oral intake of indomethacin, 75 mg. Acetylch", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study examined the relationship between sex steroid concentrations and renal outcomes in male T2DM patients.\nContext 2: Greater renal function decline (RFD) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been suggested in men compared with women, and imbalances in estrogen/androgen levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease mortality in elderly men, but it remains unclear whether sex hormone disequilibrium is related to diabetic nephropathy (DN) in men with T2DM.\nContext 3: Total testosterone (T), total estradiol (E2), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total and calculated free (cf) E2/T ratios were compared in 735\u00a0male T2DM patients with (n=513) and without (n=222) DN, using a cross-sectional approach. Also, in a pilot complementary prospective nested case-control cohort, total E2/total T and cfE2/cfT were evaluated according to a hard renal outcome (HRO): end-stage renal disease/doubling of baseline serum creatinine (36\u00a0HRO cases, 72\u00a0HRO controls) and rate of eGFR decline (68\u00a0rapid vs 68\u00a0slow RFD).\nContext 4: Of over 10,000 men, mainly from the UK and USA, who responded, 80% had moderate or severe scores likely to benefit from testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). The average age was 52, but with many in their 40s when the diagnosis of 'late onset hypogonadism' is not generally considered. Other possible contributory factors to the high testosterone deficiency scores reported were obesity (29%), alcohol (17.3%), testicular problems such as mumps orchitis (11.4%), prostate problems (5.6%), urinary infection (5.2%) and diabetes 5.7%.\nContext 5: In non-parametric Spearman's correlation analyses, we found a weak association between sST2 and total testosterone (r(s)+0.126, p=0.021) and also between sST2 and estradiol (r(s)+0.117, p=0.032) in males. In females <50 years of age (n=158) and \u226550 years of age (n=32), respectively, we did not detect any significant association between sST2 and sex-hormones. As a result of multiple linear regression analyses (calculated with log sST2 as the dependent variable), we found that sST2 was significantly associated with total testosterone (\u03b2=0.126, p=0.021) and estradiol (\u03b2=0.117, p=0.032) in males. In females, sST2 was not significantly associated with any of the sex hormones.\nContext 6: In males, we found a significant association between sST2 and total testosterone (\u03b2=0.126, p=0.021) and estradiol (\u03b2=0.117, p=0.032) in males.

The promoter also responded to NaCl induction. Femu2-overexpressing transgenic algal cells exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to salt stress. Conversely, Femu2-silencing cells showed higher sensitivity to salt stress than the control. Physiological analyses revealed that the overexpression of Femu2 increased the contents of proline and soluble sugars in transgenic cells under high salinity and that silencing Femu2 resulted in increased malondialdehyde level and decreased superoxide dismutase activity. RNA-seq results showed that a total of 248 genes have opposite expression profiles and that 5508 and 2120 genes were distinctly up-regulated or down-regulated in Femu2-overexpressing and Femu2-silencing transgenic cells under salt stress, respectively.\nContext 3: Iron plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Trichomonas vaginalis, the causative agent of highly prevalent human trichomoniasis. T. vaginalis resides in the vaginal region, where the iron concentration is constantly changing. Hence, T. vaginalis must adapt to variations in iron availability to establish and maintain an infection. The free radical signaling molecules reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) have been proven to participate in iron deficiency in eukaryotes. However, little is known about the roles of these molecules in iron-deficient T. vaginalis.\nContext 4: We used tightly controlled chemostat conditions and integrated transcriptomic datasets with statistical modeling to reveal the global effects of CO. CO is known to inhibit bacterial respiration, and we found expression of genes encoding energy-transducing pathways to be significantly affected via the global regulators, Fnr, Arc, and PdhR. Aerobically, ArcA-the response regulator-is transiently phosphorylated and pyruvate accumulates, mimicking anaerobiosis. Genes implicated in iron acquisition, and the metabolism of sulfur amino acids and arginine, are all perturbed. The global iron-related changes, confirmed by modulation of activity of the transcription factor Fur, may underlie enhanced sensitivity to CO.\nContext 5: The iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing enzyme ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) is a key regulator of iron homeostasis in bacteria.

However, natural therapies, dietary components, and physical activity may effect on these concerns. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of aerobic exercise and consumption of liquid ginger extract on lipid profile of Male rats with a high-fat fed diet.\nContext 2: 32 rats\u00a0were randomly divided\u00a0into\u00a04 groups: 1) aerobic exercise, 2) Ginger extract, 3) combined aerobic exercise and Ginger extract, and 4) the control. Subjects of the first three groups received ginger extract via gavage feeding of 250 mg/kg. The exercise program was 3 sessions per week on 3 different days over 4 weeks. Total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), HDL and LDL were measured 24-h before the first session and 24-h after the final training session.\nContext 3: The concentration of TG in the control group was significantly higher than other groups. In addition, the mean concentration of TG in the aerobic exercise group was significantly lower than Ginger extract group but there was no significant difference as compared to combined aerobic exercise and ginger extract group. The combination of aerobic exercise and ginger consumption significantly reduced the TG level compared to ginger group. TC and LDL concentrations were significantly decreased in all groups compare to control. The combination of aerobic exercise and ginger extract feeding caused a significant increase in HDL levels.\nContext 4: We evaluated adipose tissue differentiation/proliferation markers and quantified lipogenic and lipolytic activities in fat tissues of CB1-/- and CB1+/+ mice fed a high-fat (HF) or a high-fat/fish oil (HF/FO) diet as compared to animals receiving a low-fat chow diet. Comparison between HF diet and HF/FO diet allowed to investigate the influence of dietary fat quality on adipose tissue biology in relation to CB1 functioning.\nContext 5: High-fat-diet induced obese mice were administered oral with berberine (50mg/kg/day) for 14days. ATMs were analysed using FACS and insulin resistance was evaluated. Expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of inflammatory pathways were detected. The chemotaxis of macrophages was measured. Glucose consumption and insulin signalling of adipocytes were examined.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\n1.

Pressure-pain thresholds and sensitivity to sharpness were assessed on each side of the forehead twice per day during 48 hours of capsaicin treatment, and in the treated and contralateral forearm before and at the end of treatment. Heat was applied to the treated area to rekindle pain at times of forehead assessment. Hyperalgesia to sharpness, but not pressure pain, developed in the treated area whereas sensations remained stable in the contralateral forearm. Sharpness ratings decreased bilaterally in the forehead after 6 hours of treatment, and ipsilateral analgesia to pressure pain developed in the forehead when the capsaicin site was heated after 48 hours of treatment. These findings suggest that pain modulation involves unilateral regulatory mechanisms in addition to local and generalized pain control. The dissociated changes to sharpness and pressure pain indicate distinct cutaneous and deep central pain pathways.\nContext 2: Experimental muscle pain was induced by injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the left and right supraspinatus muscle of 11 healthy volunteers. One day later ropivacaine and saline were administered with ultrasound guidance in the left or right supraspinatus muscle in a randomized double-blind manner. Assessments before NGF, day 1 (before and after ropivacaine/saline), and day 7 included: visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at rest and during shoulder shrugging, time until exercise interruption owing to pain, cutaneous pain sensitivity, pressure pain thresholds, and pain VAS during tonic pressure stimulation. Cutaneous and pressure pain sensitivity were assessed over the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and deltoideus muscles, and at the web space between first and second finger.\nContext 3: Epidural analgesia is widely used for abdominal surgery due to the properties of'stress-free' anaesthesia and superior pain control. Nevertheless, sympathomimetics are known to antagonize inflammation. The present study was performed to investigate if epidural local anaesthetics caused increased local oedema formation.\nContext 4: This re-analysis used pooled data from 7 randomized controlled clinical trials. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed at the hand and at the site of maximal pain in the neck region before and after different non-pharmacological interventions. Age, gender, and pain intensity were included as covariates. The effect of interventions on pressure pain thresholds was analysed using linear mixed models. The effect of interventions on pain intensity was analysed using linear regression models.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of intravenous (IV) ketamine on pain and analgesic requirements in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). A total of 30 patients with CLBP were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (0.9% NaCl) IV. Pain intensity was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the pain interference scale (PIS) before and", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Exchange transfusion (ET) has remained a controversial adjunct therapy for the treatment of severe malaria. In order to assess the relative contribution of ET to parasite clearance in severe malaria, all patients receiving ET as an adjunct treatment to parenteral quinine or to artesunate were compared with patients treated with parenteral treatment with quinine or artesunate but who did not receive ET. ET was executed using a standardized manual isovolumetric exchange protocol.\nContext 2: A total of 87 patients with severe malaria was included; 61 received intravenous quinine, whereas 26 patients received intravenous artesunate. Thirty-nine patients received ET as an adjunct treatment to either quinine (n = 23) or artesunate (n = 16). Data from 84 of 87 patients were suitable for estimation of parasite clearance rates. PCTs were significantly shorter after administration of artesunate as compared with quinine. In both models, ET did not contribute significantly to overall parasite clearance.\nContext 3: Pre-transfusion samples from a retrospective cohort of 154 blood transfusion recipients were screened for both serological and molecular markers of HBV and Plasmodium genomes using species-specific nested PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Thirty-seven individuals met exclusion criteria and were subsequently eliminated from further analysis. Of 117 participants, 90% of recipients exhibited evidence of exposure to HBV, 42% with HBsAg and/or HBV DNA and 48% anti-HBc reactive without detectable HBV DNA. Plasmodium genome prevalence by NAT was 50%. Parasitemic individuals were significantly younger than non-parasitemic individuals (P = 0.04). Parasitemia level was not significantly lower in individuals with HBV DNA positive infections compared to those with HBV DNA negative exposures. HBV DNA load was not significantly different in parasitemic and non-parasitemic individuals.\nContext 4: The Duffy blood group (Fy) antigen functions as the receptor whereby the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax invades reticulocytes. In this study, we evaluated an autologous blood donation model to measure Fy expression during the anticipated response to blood loss.\nContext 5: 24.3% of the 121 children had severe falciparum malaria, and their mean haemoglobin was 4.49 g/dl (SD \u00b1 1.69). No significant association was found between the severity of malaria and the haemoglobin level. The mean haemoglobin level was significantly lower in children with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria (4.49 \u00b1 1.69 vs. 5.02 \u00b1 1.69 g/dl, P = 0.001). The mean haemoglobin level was significantly lower in children with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria (4.49 \u00b1 1.69 vs. 5.02 \u00b1 1.69 g/dl, P = 0.001).

This is in contrast to the results of previous studies that found that SONS was associated with improved functional outcome. The authors suggest that the lack of improvement in functional outcome may be", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2 and MMP-9 play an important role in secondary inflammatory reaction and blood-central nervous system (CNS) barrier disruption after spinal cord injury (SCI). Theoretically, it is expected that early blockade of activation of MMPs can provide neuro-protective effects from secondary tissue damage and improve functional neurological outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and to determine the regulatory effect of melatonin on MMP expression and activity after photochemically induced SCI in rats.\nContext 2: The expressions and activities of MMP-9 were increased at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI in the control group. In the melatonin-treated group, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly decreased at 24, 48, and 72 h after SCI compared with the control group, and the activity of MMP-9 was significantly reduced at 72 h after SCI. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the MMP-2 level in both groups during the experimental period. Melatonin treatment following photochemically induced SCI in rats significantly ameliorated the functional deficits. On histopathologic examination, the lesion size in the spinal cord after photothrombotic insult was significantly reduced by melatonin administration.\nContext 3: Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300 g (age 8 weeks) received focal ischemia by photothrombosis using Rose Bengal (RB). The injured animals were divided into two groups; one group received 50 mg/kg of melatonin intraperitoneally, starting 1 h after injury and at 12 h intervals for 7 days, while animals in the control group received weight-adjusted doses of a saline vehicle. In each group, the expressions and activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assessed by Western blot and gelatin zymography at various times from 6 h to 3 days. The locomotor function was assessed using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale at 3 days after SCI and then once per week for 4 weeks. The animals were killed at 28 days after the injury, and the histopathology of the lesions was assessed.\nContext 4: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to inflammatory and degenerative processes in injured nerves. Since mast cells are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of SCI, we investigated the effects of melatonin on the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the spinal cord of rats with photochemically induced SCI.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the spinal cord of rats with photochemically induced SCI.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the spinal cord of rats with photochemically induced SCI.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on the", "Yes, intermittent hypoxia regulates stem-like characteristics and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.\nExplanation: Neuroblastomas are the most common extracranial solid tumors in children. Neuroblastomas are derived from immature cells of the sympathetic nervous system and are characterized by clinical and biological heterogeneity. Hypoxia has been linked to tumor progression and increased malignancy. Intermittent hypoxia or repeated episodes of hypoxia followed by re-oxygenation is a common phenomenon in solid tumors including neuroblastoma and it has a significant influence on the outcome of therapies. The present study focuses on how intermittent hypoxia modulates the stem-like properties and differentiation in neuroblastoma cells.\nHypoxia-inducible genes", "Question: Are [ Sport-related spiral fractures of the humeral diaphysis simple injuries ]?\nExplanation: The objective of the submitted paper is to demonstrate the results of sports fractures of the diaphysis of the humerus and possible complications.\nContext 1: The objective of the submitted paper is to demonstrate the results of sports fractures of the diaphysis of the humerus and possible complications.\nContext 2: During a five-year period 18 men were followed up and treated during hospitalization with a spiral fracture of the diaphysis of the humerus.

The aim of this study was to ascertain insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) delta-endotoxins to C. capitata.\nContext 2: Among 42 selected Bacillus strains, only B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) solubilised protoxins showed biological activity against C. capitata neonate larvae, whereas Bti spore and crystal mixture was inactive. Insecticidal activity of Bti protoxins was significantly enhanced by incubation with Culex pipiens L. gut extracts. Overdigestion of Bti protoxins with Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) gut extracts suppressed biological activity against C. capitata, and this correlated with degradation of Cyt toxins. Cyt1Aa solubilised protoxin showed the highest toxicity, LC(50) after 7 days of 4.93 microg cm(-2), while proteolytical processing of Cyt1Aa protoxins by larval gut extracts did not enhance insecticidal activity.\nContext 3: To prove that Bacillus thuringiensis serovar shandongiensis strain 89-T-34-22 produces several novel cytotoxic proteins against human leukaemic T cells.\nContext 4: Although Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize has been widely adopted in diverse regions around the world, relatively little is known about the susceptibility and behavioral response of certain insect pests to Bt maize in countries where this maize is not currently cultivated. These are important factors to consider as management plans are developed. These factors were investigated for Agrotis ipsilon, a global pest of maize, with Cry1F and Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 maize.\nContext 5: The commercial release of rice genetically engineered to express a Cry1Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for control of Lepidoptera in China is a subject of debate. One major point of the debate has focused on the ecological safety of Bt rice on nontarget organisms, especially predators and parasitoids that help control populations of insect pests.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Is the use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize in China safe for nontarget organisms?\nYes, no, maybe\nExplanation:\nYes: The use of Bt maize in China is safe for nontarget organisms because the Cry1Ab protein is not toxic to nontarget organisms. The Cry1Ab protein is not toxic to nontarget organisms because it is not toxic to nontarget organisms. The Cry1Ab protein is not toxic to nontarget organisms because it is not toxic to nontarget organisms. The Cry1Ab protein is not toxic to nontarget organisms because it is not toxic to nontarget organisms.

Inflammation is a normal response to injury or infection, but it can also be a sign of disease. Inflammation is a complex process that involves a number of different molecules and cells. Inflammation is a normal response to injury or infection, but it can also be a sign of disease. Inflammation is a complex process that involves a number of different molecules and cells. Inflammation is a normal response", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Our previous data showed membrane hyperpolarization of arteriolar smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) caused by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) activation contributed to vascular hyporeactivity in shock. Despite supply of oxygen and nutrients, vascular hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictor agents still remains, which may result from low ATP level. The study was designed to investigate shock-induced mitochondrial changes of rat ASMCs in the genesis and treatment of hypotension in severe shock.\nContext 2: Ultrastructurally, the hemorrhagic shock group showed swollen mitochondria with poorly defined cristae. In this group, the number of ASMCs with low mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8(m)) was increased by 49.7%, and the intracellular ATP level was reduced by 82.1%, which led to activation of K(ATP) plasma membrane channels with resultant ASMC hyperpolarization and low vasoreactivity. These changes were reduced in the CsA+shock group. When mitochondrial damage was aggravated by ATR in the ATR+CsA+shock group, the CsA did not protect. Compared to the shock group, vasoresponsiveness to NE was much improved in the CsA+shock group.\nContext 3: Smooth muscle cells (SMC) constitute the major contractile cell population of blood vessels and inner organs. SMC contraction depends on energy provided by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) catabolism, which can be generated through oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria or by anaerobic glycolysis. Mitochondrial activity may also modulate smooth muscle tone by biotransformation of vasoactive mediators. Here, we study the role of mitochondrial DNA gene expression for vascular function in vivo.\nContext 4: Ischemia-reperfusion injury decreased viability in all tourniquet limbs, but viability was not improved in either PostC group. Likewise, I/R resulted in substantial muscle edema that was not reduced by PostC. The predominant histologic feature was necrosis, but no significant differences were found among groups. Markers of oxidative stress were increased similarly among groups after I/R, although myeloperoxidase activity was significantly increased only in the no conditioning ischemic group. A protective effect from PostC was not observed in our model suggesting that PostC was not effective in reducing I/R skeletal muscle injury or any benefits of PostC were not mediated by anti-oxidant effects.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the novel anti-oxidant, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL), on the development of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in the rat skeletal muscle. The results showed that TEMPOL significantly reduced the severity of I/R injury in the skeletal muscle. The results also showed that TEMPOL significantly reduced the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the skeletal muscle. The results also showed that TEMPOL significantly reduced the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Local recurrence and cure rates following abdominoperineal resections have been reported to be much worse than sphincter-preserving anterior resections. We compared the oncologic outcomes of patients treated by abdominoperineal resections with those following sphincter-preserving anterior resections.\nContext 2: The query returned 153 patients (abdominoperineal resection = 68, low anterior resection = 85) with a median follow-up of 24 (3-64) mo. The after abdominoperineal resection group had a higher mean age (63 + 12 vs. 54 + 12, p < 0.001) and more American Society of Anesthesiologists classification 3/4 patients (65 percent vs. 43 percent, p = 0.03) than low anterior resection. Other demographics, tumor stage, use of chemoradiation, overall postoperative complication rates, and quality-of-life follow-up time were not statistically different in both groups. Patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection had a lower baseline short-form-36 mental component score than those undergoing low anterior resection. However, 6 mo after surgery this difference was no longer statistically significant and essentially disappeared at 36 mo after surgery.\nContext 3: To evaluate the oncological results and possible benefits associated with extralevatory abdominoperineal excision (ELAPE) when compared with conventional abdominoperineal excision (APE).\nContext 4: There were a total of 93 abdominoperineal resections (12.1 percent), 547 anterior resections with straight anastomoses (71 percent), and 130 anterior resections with pouch anastomoses (16.9 percent). Postoperative mortality was 2.6 percent and postoperative morbidity was 13.6 percent with an overall anastomotic leakage rate of 2.5 percent. The cumulative five-year local recurrence rate was 5.4 percent for abdominoperineal resections, 3.6 percent for anterior resections with straight anastomoses, and 3.8 percent for anterior resections with pouch anastomoses (P = 0.73 by log-rank test). The median time to local recurrence also did not differ significantly between the different procedures (abdominoperineal resections, 17 months, anterior resections with straight anastomoses, 15 months, and anterior resections with pouch anastomoses, 14 months). The five-year overall survival rate was 83.3 percent for abdominoperineal resections, 86.7 percent for anterior resections with straight anastomoses, and 86.7 percent for anterior resections with pouch anastomoses (P = 0.99 by log-rank test). The five-year disease-free survival rate was 78.3 percent for abdominoperineal resections, 81.4 percent for anterior resections with straight anastomoses, and 81.4 percent for anterior resections with pouch anastomoses (P = 0.99 by log", "Question: Is significant bronchospasm during sickle cell painful crises associated with a lower peripheral eosinophil count??\nExplanation: The presence of eosinophils in the peripheral airways and parenchyma of asthmatic lungs has been well established. However, the expression of cytokines within the peripheral airways has been largely unexplored. The purpose of our study was to test the hypothesis that TH2-type cytokines are increased in the peripheral airways and parenchyma of asthmatic lungs. We found that eosinophils were present in the peripheral airways and parenchyma of asthmatic lungs. Furthermore, the expression of TH2-type cytokines was increased in the peripheral airways", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Decreased salt intake did not affect phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction but increased acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation and also increased the response to phenylephrine after inhibition of NO synthase by L-NAME (100\u03bcM) and iNOS protein expression was elevated. Cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10\u03bcM) and COX-2 inhibitor NS 398 (1\u03bcM) decreased the reactivity to phenylephrine in low-salt-treated group, and COX-2 protein expression was elevated in low-salt group. The effects of apocynin (10\u03bcM); superoxide anion scavenger, tiron (1mM); hydrogen peroxide scavenger, catalase (1000UmL(-1)); and ACE and AT1 receptor blockers, enalapril (10\u03bcM) and losartan (10\u03bcM) on vascular reactivity were not different between two groups. The levels of AT1 protein expression were similar in both groups.\nContext 2: We used Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats fed a high-salt diet as a model of HF. DS rats fed a low-salt diet were used as a control. BCAA were administered in drinking water from 11weeks of age, when cardiac hypertrophy was established but the cardiac function was preserved. Survival and the cardiac function were monitored, and animals were sacrificed at 21weeks of age and analyzed.\nContext 3: To compare the volumes of renomedullary interstitial cell (RMIC) lipid droplets (putative source of vasodepressor substance) in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats on high and low salt diets as an indication of whether the renomedullary vasodepressor system of the SHR is defective.\nContext 4: Thirty-one hypertensive volunteers (17 salt-resistant, 14 salt-sensitive) completed a randomized, crossover, double-blind protocol with three dietary phases: low salt diet (10 mmol/day) followed by two consecutive high salt diets (200 mmol/day), each for 6 days. During high salt, volunteers were randomized to fenofibrate 160 mg/day or placebo. Hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were measured on the last morning of each treatment arm.\nContext 5: In confirmation of our earlier study, a high salt diet resulted in a significant rise in arterial pressure and urinary albumin excretion in MnSOD knockout mice. The high salt diet also resulted in a significant increase in the number of glomerular mesangial cells and the number of glomerular mesangial cells expressing the glomerular mesangial cell marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin. The high salt diet also resulted in a significant increase in the number of glomerular mesangial cells expressing the glomerular mesangial cell marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin.

To manipulate the expression of HOXA7, the HOXA7 specific siRNA was used to knockdown HOXA7 in KGN. Conversely, HOXA7 was overexpressed in SVOG by transfection with the pcDNA3.1-HOAX7 vector. Cell proliferation was measured by the MTT assay.\nContext 2: Homeobox (HOX) genes encode transcription factors, which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. The deregulation of HOX genes is frequently associated with human reproductive system disorders. However, knowledge regarding the role of HOX genes in human granulosa cells is limited.\nContext 3: Our results show that HOXA7 and EGFR were overexpressed in KGN cells compared to hGCs and SVOG cells. Knockdown of HOXA7 in KGN cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and EGFR expression. Overexpression of HOXA7 in SVOG cells significantly promoted cell growth and EGFR expression. Moreover, the EGF-induced KGN proliferation was abrogated, and the activation of downstream signaling was diminished when HOXA7 was knocked down. Overexpression of HOXA7 in SVOG cells had an opposite effect.\nContext 4: CD97 is a member of the epidermal growth factor-seven transmembrane (EGF-TM7) family of adhesion receptors and is broadly expressed on hematopoietic cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD97 on hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells (HSC/HPC).\nContext 5: Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that control patterning of virtually all organ systems including the vasculature. Tumor angiogenesis is stimulated by several homeobox genes that are overexpressed in tumor cells, but the mechanisms of these genes are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which DLX4, a homeobox gene that is associated with increased tumor microvessel density, stimulates ovarian tumor angiogenesis.\n\nBased on the contexts above, the following is the conclusion:\n    - HOXA7 and EGFR are overexpressed in KGN cells compared to hGCs and SVOG cells.\n    - Knockdown of HOXA7 in KGN cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and EGFR expression.\n    - Overexpression of HOXA7 in SVOG cells significantly promoted cell growth and EGFR expression.\n    - The EGF-induced KGN proliferation was abrogated, and the activation of downstream signaling was diminished when HOXA7 was knocked down.\n    - Overexpression of HOXA7 in SVOG cells had an opposite effect.\n    - CD97 is a member of the epidermal growth factor-seven transmembrane (EGF-TM7) family", "Question: Does incentive spirometry enhance recovery after thoracic surgery??\nContext 1: To investigate the additional effect of incentive spirometry to chest physiotherapy to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery for lung and esophageal resections.\nContext 2: Physiotherapy (breathing exercises, huffing, and coughing) (PT) plus incentive spirometry (IS) was compared with PT alone.\nContext 3: complete resection and one or more known risk factors in form of COPD, cardiovascular disorders, advanced age or other comorbidities.

We compared these results with data obtained in a previous study after the administration of vecuronium, rocuronium, and cisatracurium. Eighteen ASA physical status I and II patients were studied. After the induction of anesthesia, tracheal intubation was accomplished without relaxants. The evoked electromyographic response to 0.10-Hz single stimuli was continuously recorded. After baseline stabilization, a single bolus of atracurium, averaging 0.21 mg/kg, was administered. If peak twitch depression did not fall within the range of 90%-98%, the patient was excluded. The time to 50% and 90% of peak effect was recorded. The time to 90% of maximal effect (192 +/- 23 s) was not different from that previously observed for vecuronium (201 +/- 20 s). The time to 50% of peak effect (110 +/- 15 s) was shorter (P < 0.05) after atracurium administration than after vecuronium (125 +/- 9 s). The onset times recorded for atracurium were slower than previously observed after rocuronium and more rapid than that which was seen after cisatracurium (P < 0.001). The observed onset profile of atracurium was considerably slower than anticipated, based on the drug's molar potency. The 95% effective dose (microM/kg) may not be a reliable predictor of a muscle relaxant's onset time, when the drug administered is a mixture isomers of varying potency.\nContext 2: Stiffness indices and FMD 24 hours after administration of 80mg atorvastatin did not differ from baseline measurements (6.89 +/- 1.90 vs. 7.06 +/- 2.37 p : NS and 9.13 +/- 6.07 vs. 9.80 +/- 6.34 p : NS).\nContext 3: One patient and the corresponding match were excluded from the analysis. The elimination half-life of alfentanil was similar in the control and atorvastatin groups (98.8 +/- 12.4 versus 98.3 +/- 12.4 minutes, respectively, p : NS). The mean plasma concentration of alfentanil at 30 minutes after the end of the infusion was 0.8 +/- 0.2 versus 0.8 +/- 0.2 microg/mL in the control and atorvastatin groups, respectively (p : NS). The mean plasma concentration of alfentanil at 60 minutes after the end of the infusion was 0.4 +/- 0.1 versus 0.4 +/- 0.1 microg/mL in the control and atorvastatin groups, respectively (p : NS).

The benefit of adding cisapride to PEG-EL is controversial, and its influence on the effectiveness of NAP has not been investigated. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether cisapride improves the effectiveness and/or tolerableness of bowel preparation with either NAP or PEG-EL.\nContext 2: The effect of pre-treatment with cisapride on colonoscopy preparation with lavage solution was compared in 120 out-patients less than 60 years and 73 out-patients 60 years or older, who were scheduled for total colonoscopy. By random allocation, patients were assigned to receive cisapride 10 mg or placebo 30 minutes before ingesting the magnesium citrate lavage solution.\nContext 3: Successful colonoscopies require good bowel preparations-poor bowel preparations can increase medical costs, rates of missed lesions, and procedure duration. The combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 without electrolytes (MiraLAX; Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) and 64 oz of Gatorade (PepsiCo, Inc, Purchase, NY) has gained popularity as a bowel preparation regimen. However, the efficacy and tolerability of this approach has not been compared with standard bowel preparations in clinical trials. We compared split-dose (PEG) 3350 with electrolytes (GoLytely; Braintree Laboratories, Inc, Braintree, MA) with split-dose MiraLAX alone and in combination with pretreatment medications (bisacodyl or lubiprostone) to determine the efficacy and patient tolerability of MiraLAX as an agent for bowel preparation.\nContext 4: Endoscopists scored the bowel preparation as either excellent or satisfactory as follows: NAP: cisapride 50% versus placebo 61% (p = 0.3); PEG-EL: cisapride 80% versus placebo 78% (p = 1.0). Cisapride did not improve tolerability or the frequency of adverse symptoms associated with either solution. The ease of bowel preparation was significantly better in the NAP group versus PEG-EL group (mean score 1.8 versus 2.8; p < 0.001). The frequency of adverse symptoms was significantly lower in the NAP group versus PEG-EL group (p < 0.001). The frequency of adverse symptoms was not significantly different between the NAP and PEG-EL groups.\nContext 5: The efficacy and tolerability of cisapride in combination with PEG-EL or NAP for bowel preparation was compared in 120 out-patients less than 60 years and 73 out-patients 60 years or older, who were scheduled for total colonoscopy.

One hundred and twenty-six women with artificial (surgical) menopause, who had undergone BSO in the premenopausal period, were compared with 77 women with natural menopause, who had undergone BSO in the postmenopausal period. The women were tested for bone mineral density to diagnose osteoporosis. Polymorphisms of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) genes UGT2B17 and UGT1A1 were analyzed, and their association with bone mass and osteoporosis was statistically evaluated.\nContext 2: Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Previous studies have reported an association between genetic polymorphisms and the risk of developing osteoporosis. However, the relationship between osteoporosis and genetic polymorphisms in Japanese women treated with BSO is not well understood. To improve the quality of life for post-BSO patients, it is important to determine the genetic factors that influence their risk for osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between gene variations of estrogen metabolism-related genes and osteoporosis in surgically menopausal patients, which may improve their quality of life.\nContext 3: No significant association was found between osteoporosis and polymorphisms in ESR1, UGT2B17, or UGT1A1 in both groups, suggesting that BSO might be a more significant physiological factor in influencing bone mass density compared to genetic variations.\nContext 4: The biosynthesis of estrogens from androgens is catalyzed by aromatase P450 enzyme, coded by the CYP19A1 gene on chromosome 15q21.2. Genetic variation within the CYP19A1 gene sequence has been shown to alter the function of the enzyme. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a non-synonymous Arg264Cys (rs700519) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with altered levels of circulating estradiol, areal bone mineral density or fracture.\nContext 5: The COLIA1 gene is a strong candidate for susceptibility to osteoporosis. The causal genetic variants are currently unclear, but the most likely are functional polymorphisms in the promoter and intron 1 regions. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COLIA1 gene polymorphisms and osteoporosis in Japanese women treated with BSO.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of estrogen metabolism-related genes and osteoporosis in surgically menopausal patients, which may improve their quality of life.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of estrogen metabolism-related genes and osteoporosis in surgically menopausal patients, which may improve their quality of life.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of estrogen metabolism-related genes and osteoporosis in surg", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of the study was to examine the atheroprotective effect of dietary curcumin in a mouse model of atherosclerosis and to identify its cellular and molecular targets at the vascular level.\nContext 2: To investigate the protective effect and the possible mechanism of curcumin on anti-atherosclerosis.\nContext 3: ApoE(-/-)  mice were fed with curcumin at 0.2% (wt/wt) in diet for 4 months. This supplementation reduced the extent of atherosclerotic lesion by 26% and induced changes in expression of genes implicated in cell adhesion and transendothelial migration or cytoskeleton organization, as revealed by a transcriptomic analysis in the aorta. Expression profile of these genes suggests reduction in both leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed a reduction (-37%) in macrophage infiltration in the plaque, as measured by immunohistochemistry, and, in vitro, a lower adhesion of monocytes to TNF-\u03b1-stimulated endothelial cells (-32%) after exposure to a nutritionally achievable concentration of curcumin. These changes in gene expression could be related to the observed increased expression of I\u03baB protein and decrease of TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB/DNA binding and NF-\u03baB-transcriptional activity upon exposure to curcumin.\nContext 4: COPD is mainly caused by tobacco smoking and is associated with a high frequency of coronary artery disease. There is growing recognition that the inflammation in COPD is not only confined to the lungs but also involves the systemic circulation and can impact nonpulmonary organs, including blood vessels. \u03b11-antitrypsin-low-density lipoprotein (AT-LDL) complex is an oxidatively modified LDL that accelerates atherosclerosis. Curcumin, one of the best-investigated natural products, is a powerful antioxidant. However, the effects of curcumin on AT-LDL remain unknown. We hypothesized that Theracurmin(\u00ae), a highly absorptive curcumin with improved bioavailability using a drug delivery system, ameliorates the inflammatory status in subjects with mild COPD.\nContext 5: Curcumin has antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it remains unknown whether curcumin has any protective effects on sepsis.

Lovastatin at high doses inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, we identified the up-regulation of the actin-binding protein transgelin 2 in endothelial cells following treatment with lovastatin. Changes in transgelin 2 levels were confirmed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. We further demonstrated that the Rho signaling inactivation and actin depolymerization contributed to the up-regulation of transgelin 2. The knockdown of transgelin 2 by siRNA dramatically enhanced endothelial migration and tube formation, and meanwhile attenuated the inhibitory effects of lovastatin on cell motility. Moreover, the lovastatin-induced inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation was also reversed by transgelin 2 knockdown. The activation of Rho GTPase in the absence of transgelin 2 may represent a mechanism underlying the regulation of phosphorylated myosin light chain by transgelin 2.\nContext 2: Anti-angiogenic activity is considered to play a key role in the statin-induced anti-tumor effects. We aimed to identify new targets underlying this pleiotropic effect of lovastatin.\nContext 3: Angiotensin II (AngII) induces migration and growth of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), which is responsible for vascular remodelling in some cardiovascular diseases. Ang II also activates a Cl(-) current, but the underlying mechanism is not clear.\nContext 4: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are frequently used lipid-lowering drugs. Moreover, they exert pleiotropic effects on cellular stress responses and death. Here, we analysed whether lovastatin affects the sensitivity of primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) to the anticancer drug doxorubicin.\nContext 5: We now demonstrate that VEGF-induced survival on collagen I impairs the ability of three known angiostatic molecules, TSP-1, IP-10 and endostatin to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. Apoptosis of endothelial cells, growing on collagen I, induced by TSP-1 and IP-10 was also inhibited following VEGF stimulation. In contrast, endostatin was not affected by VEGF. The inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by TSP-1 and IP-10 was reversed by the addition of VEGF. The inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by endostatin was not affected by VEGF. The inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by TSP-1 and IP-10 was reversed by the addition of VEGF. The inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by endostatin was not affected by VEGF.

Research since has shown that lincRNAs constitute an important layer of genome regulation across a wide spectrum of species. However, the factors governing their evolution and origins remain relatively unexplored. One possible factor driving lincRNA evolution and biological function is transposable element (TE) insertions. Here, we comprehensively characterize the TE content of lincRNAs relative to genomic averages and protein coding transcripts.\nContext 2: Our analysis of the TE composition of 9,241 human lincRNAs revealed that, in sharp contrast to protein coding genes, 83% of lincRNAs contain a TE, and TEs comprise 42% of lincRNA sequence. lincRNA TE composition varies significantly from genomic averages - L1 and Alu elements are depleted and broad classes of endogenous retroviruses are enriched. TEs occur in biased positions and orientations within lincRNAs, particularly at their transcription start sites, suggesting a role in lincRNA transcriptional regulation. Accordingly, we observed a dramatic example of HERVH transcriptional regulatory signals correlating strongly with stem cell-specific expression of lincRNAs. Conversely, lincRNAs devoid of TEs are expressed at greater levels than lincRNAs with TEs in all tissues and cell lines, particularly in the testis.\nContext 3: Non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons are eukaryotic mobile genetic elements that transpose by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. We have performed a systematic search for sequences matching the characteristic reverse transcriptase domain of non-LTR retrotransposons in the sequenced regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome.\nContext 4: Retrotransposition is detrimental to host genome stability and thus eukaryotic cells have developed mechanisms to limit the expansion of retrotransposons by Dicer-mediated RNAi silencing pathways. However, the mechanisms that control the activity and copy numbers of transposable elements in chicken remain unclear. Here, we describe how the loss of Dicer in chicken cells does not reactivate endogenous chicken CR1 retrotransposons with impaired RNAi machinery, suggesting that the control of chicken CR1 is independent of Dicer-induced RNAi silencing. In contrast, upon introduction of a functionally active human L1 retrotransposable element that contains an intact Dicer binding site, chicken cells reactivated the endogenous CR1 retrotransposon. This suggests that the chicken CR1 retrotransposon is regulated by a mechanism that is independent of Dicer-mediated RNAi silencing.\nContext 5: The human genome encodes a large number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are involved in a wide range of biological processes. The majority of these ncRNAs are transcribed from introns of protein-coding genes. However, a small fraction of ncRNAs are transcribed from intergenic regions of the genome. The majority of these intergenic ncRNAs are transcribed from the 5' end of the gene, but a small fraction of them are", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The infection with E. coli did not influence the onset of clinical EAE symptoms or disease severity.

Recent studies have demonstrated that spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) in the mouse oxyntic mucosa arises from transdifferentiation of mature gastric chief cells. Other investigations of intestinal progenitor cells have shown that cells demonstrating transcriptional activity for leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) in the intestine, colon and gastric antrum function as adult stem cells. We have now investigated whether cells demonstrating Lgr5 transcriptional activity in the oxyntic mucosa of mice might be responsible for development of metaplasia.\nContext 2: Gastric cancer evolves in the setting of a pathologic mucosal milieu characterized by both loss of acid-secreting parietal cells and mucous cell metaplasias. Indeed, mucous cell metaplasia is considered the critical preneoplastic lesion for gastric cancer. Previous investigations have shown that infection of mice with Helicobacter felis or induction of acute parietal cell loss with the drug DMP-777 leads to the emergence of a type of metaplasia designated spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM). We have hypothesized that SPEM arises from proliferating cells in gland bases, either from a cryptic progenitor cell or by transdifferentiation of mature chief cells.\nContext 3: Cells expressing transcriptional activity for Lgr5 in the oxyntic mucosa were present as scattered rare cells only along the lesser curvature of the stomach. These cells also stained for markers of chief cells (intrinsic factor and pepsinogen) but never showed any staining for proliferative markers (Ki-67). In Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre(ERT2/+);Rosa26R mice induced with tamoxifen, treatment with either DMP-777 or L-635 to induce acute oxyntic atrophy caused induction of SPEM, but no lineage mapping into SPEM from Lgr5-expressing cells was observed.\nContext 4: Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre(ERT2/+);Rosa26R mice were used to examine the distribution of Lgr5 transcriptionally active cells in the normal oxyntic mucosa as well as after treatment with DMP-777 or L-635. In the normal oxyntic mucosa, Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre(ERT2/+);Rosa26R mice showed a similar distribution of Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre(ERT2/+);Rosa26R cells as seen in wild-type mice. In the oxyntic mucosa of mice treated with DMP-777 or L-635, Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre(ERT2/+);Rosa26R cells were present in the oxyntic glands, but not in the oxyntic glands of wild-type mice. These results suggest that Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-Cre(ERT2", "Contexts:\nContext 1: CD40 has been shown to be a functional activation antigen on a variety of cell types involved in immune responses. As intestinal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may play a role during mucosal inflammation, we investigated the functional consequences of CD40 induction in primary cultures of human colonic fibroblasts.\nContext 2: The aim of this study was to evaluate the tissue-specificity of ck20 mRNA transcription and its use for detecting circulating colon epithelial cells.\nContext 3: After administration of dextran sulfate sodium, Tnfsf14(-/-) mice developed more severe colitis than controls, based on their reduced survival, accelerated loss of body weight, and histologic scores. LIGHT protected mice from colitis via the lymphotoxin \u03b2 receptor and was expressed mainly by myeloid cells in the colon. Colons of Tnfsf14(-/-) mice also had increased accumulation of innate immune cells and higher levels of cytokines than colons from control mice. LIGHT, therefore, appears to regulate inflammation in the colon.\nContext 4: We studied the role of LIGHT in intestinal inflammation using Tnfsf14(-/-) and wild-type mice. Colitis was induced by transfer of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells into Rag1(-/-) or Tnfsf14(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mice, or by administration of dextran sulfate sodium to Tnfsf14(-/-) or wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Mice were weighed, colon tissues were collected and measured, and histology analyses were performed. We measured infiltrating cell populations and expression of cytokines, chemokines, and LIGHT.\nContext 5: After priming with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) (200 U/ml) for 72 hours, five of eight tested PCLF cultures showed induction of CD40 surface display (up to 10-fold). Induction of CD40 mRNA expression was demonstrated by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction. In the responder-PCLF cultures, IFN-gamma alone caused a 1.5-5-fold increase in interleukin (IL)-8 secretion. Addition of 1 ng/ml CD40L was sufficient to achieve a further increase in IL-8, IL-6, or monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) secretion (2.5-18-fold of controls). Incubation of the responder-PCLF cultures with 1 ng/ml CD40L for 24 hours resulted in a 2.5- to 5-fold increase in IL-8 secretion. In the responder-PCLF cultures, IFN-gamma alone caused a 1.5-5-fold increase in IL-8 secretion. Addition of 1 ng/ml CD40L was sufficient to achieve a further increase in IL-6, or MCP-1 secretion (2.5-18-fold of controls). Incubation of the responder-PCLF cultures with 1 ng/ml CD40L for 24 hours resulted in a 2.5- to 5-fold increase in IL-8 secretion. In the responder-P", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing chemoradiotherapy are at high risk of malnutrition, which is related to complication rate. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an early intensive nutritional intervention on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for HNC.\nContext 2: A prospective audit of patients treated for head and neck cancer was undertaken at four centres over a three-month period in 2009. Nutritional outcomes were collected at 3, 6 and 12 months, and the data were statistically analysed.\nContext 3: We analysed retrospectively the clinical documentation of 33 HNC patients who were referred for early nutritional intervention (nutrition intervention group, NG) before they were submitted to chemoradiotherapy. The outcome of these patients was compared to that of 33 patients who received chemoradiotherapy without receiving a specifically designed early nutrition support programme (control group, CG).\nContext 4: This study was conducted for the nutritional assessment of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and to investigate the changes in nutrition status, oral intake, morbidity and quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients after intensive nutrition counseling.\nContext 5: NG patients lost less weight during chemoradiotherapy compared to CG patients (-4.6 +/- 4.1% vs -8.1 +/- 4.8% of pre-treatment weight, p < 0.01, at the completion of treatment). Patients in the NG experienced fewer radiotherapy breaks (>5 days) for toxicity (30.3% vs 63.6%, p < 0.01); the mean number of days of radiation delayed for toxicity was 4.4 +/- 5.2 in NG vs 7.6 +/- 6.5 in CG (p < 0.05); a linear correlation was found between percentage of weight lost from baseline to chemoradiotherapy completion and days of radiation delays (p < 0.01). There were less patients who had an unplanned hospitalisation in the NG relative to the CG (16.1% vs 41.4%, p = 0.03). In the NG, symptoms having an effect on the nutritional status developed early and were present in the nearly totality of patients at chemotherapy completion; 60.6% of NG patients needed tube feeding.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an early intensive nutritional intervention on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an early intensive nutritional intervention on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an early intensive nutritional intervention on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an early intensive nutritional intervention on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Hypothalamic hormones represent a peculiar group of hormones present in milk in surprisingly high concentrations. High levels of these neuropeptides raised the question of their origin. The hypothesis suggesting local synthesis of TRH in the mammary gland was, therefore, tested. Acid extracts of human milk contained TRH and TRH-OH immunoreactivity. RIA determinations at various purification steps revealed that only a part of the immunoreactivity may represent authentic peptides. No high molecular weight TRH precursor could be demonstrated upon a sequential enzymatic treatment of human milk and rat mammary gland extracts. Exploration of rat mammary gland tissue for TRH mRNA showed that the TRH gene is not expressed in the mammary gland. Rat mammary gland homogenates were able to deamidate exogenous TRH to TRH-OH.\nContext 2: Immunohistochemistry was used in murine mammary glands that had been labeled with [3H]thymidine during allometric growth to investigate the co-expression of DNA label retention and estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha or progesterone receptor (PR). Using the same methods, we investigated the co-localization of [3H]thymidine and ER-alpha or PR in mammary tissue from mice that had received treatment with estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin subsequent to a long chase period to identify label-retaining cells.\nContext 3: Immunostaining was performed to determine the expression pattern of K6a throughout mammary gland development, from the embryonic mammary bud to lactation. Double immunofluorescence was used to co-localize K6 with known markers of mammary gland development. Wild-type and K6ab-null mammary tissues were transplanted into the cleared fat pads of nude mice and the outgrowths were analyzed for morphology by whole-mount staining and for markers of mammary epithelium by immunostaining. Finally, progesterone receptor (PR) and bromodeoxyuridine co-localization was quantified by double immunofluorescence in wild-type and K6ab-null mammary outgrowths.\nContext 4: The milk yield, body weight gain of offspring, mammary gland index and serum PRL concentration in 10 min group were significantly greater than those in the control group and 5 min group (P<0.05). Compared with the other two groups, the 10 min group showed significantly increased acinar gland expansion and acinar number.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in the mammary gland of rats. The results showed that the expression of ER and PR in the mammary gland of rats was significantly increased after treatment with 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) in the mammary gland of rats. The results showed that the expression of ER and PR in the mammary gland of rats was significantly increased after treatment with 5", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We therefore carried out a systematic analysis of canonical Wnt signaling in mutant embryos and cells that lack primary cilia because of loss of the anterograde IFT kinesin-II motor (Kif3a) or IFT complex B proteins (Ift172 or Ift88). We also analyzed mutant embryos with abnormal primary cilia due to defects in retrograde IFT (Dync2h1). The mouse IFT mutants express the canonical Wnt target Axin2 and activate a transgenic canonical Wnt reporter, BAT-gal, in the normal spatial pattern and to the same quantitative level as wild type littermates. Similarly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from IFT mutants respond normally to added Wnt3a. The switch from canonical to non-canonical Wnt also appears normal in IFT mutant MEFs, as both wild-type and mutant cells do not activate the canonical Wnt reporter in the presence of both Wnt3a and Wnt5a.\nContext 2: Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the mouse requires the microtubule-based organelle, the primary cilium. The primary cilium is assembled and maintained through the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT) and the response to Shh is blocked in mouse mutants that lack proteins required for IFT. Although the phenotypes of mouse IFT mutants do not overlap with phenotypes of known Wnt pathway mutants, recent studies report data suggesting that the primary cilium modulates responses to Wnt signals.\nContext 3: Primary cilia are essential for Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction in vertebrates. Although the core components of the Hh pathway are highly conserved, the dependency on cilia in Hh signaling is considered to be lower in fish than in mice, suggesting the presence of species-specific mechanisms for Hh signal transduction.\nContext 4: To precisely understand the role of cilia in Hh signaling in fish and explore the evolution of Hh signaling, we have generated a maternal-zygotic medaka (Oryzias latipes) mutant that lacks cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 2 (dhc2; MZdhc2), a component required for retrograde intraflagellar transport. We found that MZdhc2 exhibited the shortened cilia and partial defects in Hh signaling, although the Hh defects were milder than zebrafish mutants lacking cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 1 (dhc1; Zdhc1). We also found that the Hh signaling defects in MZdhc2 were rescued by the addition of exogenous Shh. These results suggest that the cilia are required for Hh signaling in medaka, and that the cilia are not essential for Hh signaling in zebrafish.\nContext 5: The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for vertebrate development. The Hh pathway is activated by the binding of the Hh ligand to the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc) and the downstream effector Smoothened (Smo). The Hh pathway is also activated by", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Radiotherapy to the thorax increases the risk of radiation-induced heart disease. We and others have shown that local irradiation to the murine heart results in inflammatory and fibrotic responses and decreased microvascular density. In the present study we tested whether thalidomide is able to inhibit radiation-induced heart disease.\nContext 2: Irradiation led to an increase in epicardial thickness and infiltrating inflammatory cells in the epicardium as well as an increase in interstitial collagen content. The microvasculature had a decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced pericyte coverage. Thalidomide had no protective role in any of these processes. There were no differences in heart function measured between the treatment groups.\nContext 3: Forty-two patients were assessable, as data on the cardiac status were missing in 7 patients. The majority of patients received at least 40 Gy, and 75% of them were treated with one field per day. The median follow-up of patients is 13.5 years (range 9-24.5). Eleven cardiac complications were observed in 9 patients (coronary artery disease [n = 2], conduction-system abnormalities [n = 3], valvular defects [n = 5], and congestive heart disease [n = 1]). The median 15-year actuarial incidence of cardiac complications was 21% (95% confidence interval of 9-40%). The positive and negative predictive value of thallium scintigraphy was 19% and 77%, respectively. The univariate analysis showed that the extent of left ventricle exposure to irradiation was an adverse prognostic factor, and chemotherapy administered before mantle field irradiation was of borderline significance.\nContext 4: There is growing clinical interest in thalidomide for the treatment of various disorders due to its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-angiogenic properties. In numerous clinical trials thalidomide is used as an adjunct to standard therapy. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of all possible drug-drug interactions that might occur with this drug. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug efflux transporter that is expressed in many tissues, is the cause of several drug-drug interactions. P-gp induction or inhibition can lead to ineffective therapy or side-effects. In this study, we investigated thalidomide's potential to cause drug-drug interactions on the basis of its P-gp expression.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thalidomide on the expression of P-gp in human breast cancer cells. The effect of thalidomide on P-gp expression was investigated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The effect of thalidomide on P-gp expression was also investigated by flow cytometry. The effect of thalidomide on P-gp expression was also investigated by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The effect of thalidomide on P-gp expression was also investigated by flow cytometry.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most useful of all tumor markers. Although the sensitivity is impressive, low specificity results in a lack of cancer detection in a significant proportion of patients undergoing prostate biopsy. Several recent studies have addressed the need for improved specificity. Of all these approaches, the free/total PSA ratio appears to be the most promising. Given that most circulating PSA is complexed to alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and that this moiety represents a greater proportion of the total PSA in those men with carcinoma, we set out to determine whether complexed PSA would improve specificity in the detection of men with prostate cancer.\nContext 2: Prostate cancer was detected in 23 of the patients (9%) who were thought to have benign disease. Normal ranges for the distribution of the PSA levels were established based on the patients with a benign histology, but these ranges did not detect most of the unknown cancers. The sensitivity of the total PSA test in detecting cancer was 38% and the specificity 90%. The discrimination was no better when considering the free fraction or the free-to-total PSA level. However, none of the 14 patients whose cancer was missed showed general progression of the disease during the 5-year follow-up and only one died from prostate cancer. In contrast, eight of the 20 patients with a known prostatic malignancy showed general progression, and six died from the disease.\nContext 3: The overall detection rate of prostate cancer between 1992 and 2000 was 0.73%. The detection rate in men with a PSA level between 3.1 and 3.9 ng/mL, and between 4 and 9.9 ng/mL was 1.6% and 8.3%, respectively. Of 4661 determinations of PSA, 2553 (54.8%) were found to be < or = 1 ng/mL, 1273 (27.3%) were between 1.1 and 2 ng/mL, and 401 (8.6%) were between 2.1 and 3 ng/mL. Four hundred and thirty-four men (9.3%) had PSA levels > or = 3.1 ng/mL, with possible indications for prostate biopsy. Of the men tested, 1.4% with an initial PSA level of < or = 2 ng/mL and 22.3% with an initial level between 2.1 and 3 ng/mL had a subsequent PSA level of > or = 3.1 ng/mL. The sensitivity of the PSA test in detecting cancer was 38% and the specificity 90%. The discrimination was no better when considering the free fraction or the free-to-total PSA level. However, none of the 14 patients whose cancer was missed showed general progression of the disease during the 5-year follow-up and only one died from prostate cancer.

In a prospective double-blinded controlled trial, 120 ASA I female patients undergoing elective gynecological laparoscopy were randomized to one of three groups, and received either: (a) CSL 1.5 mL.kg(-1) per hour fasting duration; (b) CSL, 1.5 mL.kg(-1) per hour fasting duration with 0.5 g.kg(-1) dextrose added in 50% formulation (CSL/dextrose); or (c) no iv fluid (control).\nContext 2: To examine the effects of iv compound sodium lactate (CSL) with and without caloric supplementation with dextrose on nausea, vomiting and pain following general anesthesia for laparoscopy.\nContext 3: Postoperative nausea and vomiting after anesthesia is an distressing side effect. This study was undertaken to determine to what extent spinal opioids contribute to postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and secondly to how effectively metoclopramide can reduce the incidence of PONV after intrathecal administration of morphine.\nContext 4: Supplemental 80% oxygen administration halves the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in inpatients. Whether it prevents PONV after ambulatory surgery is unknown. We tested the efficacy of supplemental 80% oxygen in decreasing the incidence of PONV after ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy. One hundred patients were given a standardized sevoflurane anesthetic. They were randomly assigned to two groups: routine oxygen administration with 30% oxygen, balance nitrogen (Group A); and supplemental oxygen with 80% oxygen, balance nitrogen (Group B). Oxygen was administered during surgery and up to 1 h after surgery. The incidence of nausea and vomiting and the need for rescue antiemetics did not differ between the groups in the postanesthesia care unit, in the Phase II unit, or during the 24-h follow-up. The overall incidence of nausea and vomiting during the first postoperative 24 h was 62% in Group A and 55% in Group B (P = 0.486). There were no differences in the recovery profiles and patient satisfaction between the groups. In this study, supplemental oxygen did not prevent PONV in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy and to determine the efficacy of intrathecal morphine in reducing the incidence of PONV.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic laparoscopy and to determine the efficacy of intrathecal morphine in reducing the incidence of PONV.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing ambulatory gynecologic", "Question: Does human chorionic gonadotropin administration increase plasma androgen levels in patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation??\nExplanation: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone that is secreted by the placenta during pregnancy.

Incubation of human bronchial segments with IL-1beta/TNF-alpha was also performed in the presence of the COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, indomethacin.\nContext 2: Human bronchial epithelial cells were incubated with two different MWCNT samples at various concentrations for up to 96\u00a0h and several markers of EMT were investigated. Quantitative real time PCR, western blot, immunofluorescent staining and gelatin zymographies were performed to detect the marker protein alterations. ELISA was performed to evaluate TGF-\u03b2 production. Experiments with neutralizing anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody, specific inhibitors of GSK-3\u03b2 and Akt and siRNA were carried out in order to confirm their involvement in MWCNT-induced EMT. In vivo experiments of pharyngeal aspiration in C57BL/6 mice were also performed. Data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test.\nContext 3: Chronic inflammation of the airways is an important component in the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have been implicated in the induction of AHR. Whether these cytokines directly modulate the contractile properties of human airway smooth muscle (ASM) has not been fully investigated.\nContext 4: There were no significant differences in airway resistance between the steroid treated group and the control group for either steroid treatment regime. The degree of extravasation of Evans blue dye was significantly inhibited in the bronchioles after both the 1-day and 1-week treatment with methylprednisolone. There were no significant differences in MVP in the trachea or bronchi between the treated groups and the control groups.\nContext 5: Bronchioles are critical zones in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced lung inflammation. However, there have been few studies on the in vivo dynamics of cytokine gene expression in bronchiolar epithelial cells (BECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to CS. In this study, we investigated the in vivo dynamics of cytokine gene expression in BECs and SMCs in response to CS in the mouse lung.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cigarette smoke (CS) on the expression of the genes encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the mouse lung. The expression of the genes encoding the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was also investigated.\nContext", "Question: Do radiological findings support lateral residual tumour as a major cause of local recurrence of rectal cancer??\nRadiological findings support lateral residual tumour as a major cause of local recurrence of rectal cancer.\nThe study was a retrospective study from a prospectively maintained database at a tertiary referral centre.

Theoretical evaluation: Stresses on the thoraces were smaller when double bars were applied than when a single bar was applied.\nContext 3: We performed a prospective double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that compared 3 parallel groups: the CONT group did not receive any block, the PRE group received bilateral superficial cervical plexus block before surgery while under general anesthesia, and the POST group received bilateral superficial cervical plexus block after surgery while under general anesthesia. The study included 111 patients (37 in each group). Postoperative pain was assessed every 4 hours by use of a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale. All patients received paracetamol every 6 hours. Morphine was administered following a standardized protocol if the numeric rating scale was 4 or higher. The main outcome variables were the proportion of patients given morphine during the 36 hours period, pain intensity scores, and morphine consumption.\nContext 4: Clinical evaluation: The intensity of postoperative pain was compared between patients for whom a single-bar was used (single-bar group: n = 14) and those for whom double bars (double-bar group: n = 10) were used to correct the thoracic deformity. The evaluation was performed by referring to the frequency with which local anesthetics were self-injected in a patient-controlled anesthetic system and how many days were needed for the patients to resume ambulation. Theoretical evaluation: An original simulation system for the Nuss procedure was developed by producing 3-dimensional finite element analysis models from computed tomographic data of patients with pectus excavatum. With this system, single-bar and double-bar placement was simulated separately for the thorax models of the double-bar group. The stresses occurring on the thoraces were then compared between the two situations.\nContext 5: This randomized, double-blind trial studied 40 men undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia. All patients received 19 mL of lidocaine 1% infiltrated in the operative field before incision. Patients were randomized into two groups of 20. The surgical site group received ketorolac 30 mg intravenously 30 minutes before incision and 30 minutes after incision. The control group received no additional analgesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative pain. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of nausea and vomiting, the incidence of urinary retention, and the incidence of postoperative ileus.\nContext 6: This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study included 100 patients who underwent elective inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized into two groups of 50. The surgical site group received 20 mL of lidocaine 1% infiltrated in the operative field before incision. The control group received no additional analgesia. The primary outcome", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Glutamine is a nonessential amino acid that, in recent years, has been found to play important roles in several metabolic and immunologic processes. It has been theorized that, in a stressed state, it may become \"conditionally essential\" because the patient's ability to manufacture glutamine may not be adequate to meet their needs under this condition. We chose to evaluate the ability of 48 hours of enteral glutamine to enhance immediate nitrogen accretion in stressed pediatric burn patients.\nContext 2: Nine children with serious burns who were tolerating tube feedings were enrolled in a human studies committee-approved protocol in which they received 48 hours of enteral feedings with glutamine replacing 20% of essential and nonessential amino acids and 48 hours of isonitrogenous, isocaloric standard enteral feedings. This interval was chosen to help ensure that the study periods were comparable from a metabolic perspective. At the end of each period, protein kinetics were determined by a primed constant infusion of L-[1-(13)C] leucine tracer. The order of the studies was randomized. Seven children completed both phases of the study. Results were compared by paired t test and are presented as mean +/- standard error of the mean.\nContext 3: During the glutamine feeding period, the leucine flux and leucine oxidation rate were significantly lower than those in the conventional feeding period. This reflects a reduction in total leucine intake from 80 +/- 11 to 62 +/- 10 micromol/kg per hour. However, there was no significant difference in the net balance of leucine accretion into proteins between these 2 dietary periods, which indicated that enriched glutamine feeding for 48 hours did not result in an immediate whole body protein gain in this group of pediatric patients. In addition, plasma glutamine concentration showed a moderate increase after 48 hours of supplementation but did not reach significance.\nContext 4: Glutamine is one of the most abundant amino acids in both plasma and human milk, yet it is not included in standard intravenous amino acid solutions. Previous studies have suggested that parenteral nutrition (PN) supplemented with glutamine may reduce sepsis and mortality in critically ill adults. Whether glutamine supplementation would provide a similar benefit to extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants is not known.\nContext 5: Of the 721 infants who were assigned to glutamine supplementation, 370 (51%) died or developed sepsis. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the control group (P <.001). The mortality rate was also significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the control group in the 2 groups that were studied separately (P <.001). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the control group in the 2 groups that were studied separately (P <.001). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the control group in the 2 groups that were studied separately (P <.001). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the control group in the 2 groups that were studied separately (P <.001", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We investigated the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the prognosis of patients with early colon cancer who had undergone curative surgery.\nContext 2: From three national databases of patients in Taiwan, we selected a cohort of colon cancer patients who had been newly diagnosed with stage I or stage II colon cancer between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2008 and had undergone curative surgery. We collected information regarding DM (type 2 DM only), the use of antidiabetic medications, other comorbidities, and survival outcomes. The colon cancer-specific survival (CSS) and the overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with and without DM.\nContext 3: We identified 920 diabetic patients with colorectal cancer. Mean age \u00b1 SD was 70.2 \u00b1 8.6 years and 63.3% were male. Extensive use (\u226550 prescriptions) of metformin was associated with a slightly increased risk of colorectal cancer (adjusted OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.08-1.90) as compared with non use, with an adjustment of OR = 1.81 (95% CI: 1.25-2.62) in men and of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.63-1.58) in women. Neither extensive use of sulfonylureas (adjusted OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.60-1.03) nor insulin (adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.63-1.28) were associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. A long-term history of diabetes (>10 years) was not associated with a materially increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with short-term diabetes duration (<2 years; adjusted OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.90-1.46).\nContext 4: A retrospective analysis of patients having potentially curative surgery for colorectal cancer between January 1999 and December 2004.\nContext 5: A total of 86,939 patients (40,014 men, 46,925 women) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and aged \u2265 25 years in a nationally representative cohort were followed prospectively from 1995 to 2006 for bladder cancer mortality. Cox regression was used considering the following independent variables: age, sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, BMI, diabetes duration, diabetes treatment, and T2DM-related comorbidities. The hazard ratio (HR) for bladder cancer mortality was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.10-1.33) for patients with T2DM and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.04-1.23) for patients with T2DM and diabetes treatment. The HR for bladder cancer mortality was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.10-1.33) for patients with T2DM and diabetes duration \u2265 10 years and 1.13 (95% CI: 1.04-1.23) for patients", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To investigate the relationship between the chronotropic incompetence and angiographic severity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\nContext 2: Coronary angiography was performed in 130 patients suspected for CAD and angiographic severity of coronary artery was quantitated by Duke score and Gensini score. Patients were divided to 4 groups: non-CAD group (39 patients), CAD group with one coronary artery involved (CHD1 group, 30 patients), CHD group with two coronary arteries involved (CHD2 group, 31 patients) and CAD group with three coronary arteries involved (CHD3 group, 30 patients). One month before coronary angiography, symptom-limited exercise treadmill tests were made and the ratio of heart rate reserve (HRR) and the percent maximal age-predicted heart rate achieved (rHR) were measured.\nContext 3: The study included 80 patients subjected to coronary angiography. The extent of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) was assessed using Gensini score. Patients were divided into three risk groups according to hs-CRP levels (< 1 mg/L--as low risk, 1-3 mg/L--as average risk and >3 mg/L--as high risk). Mean Angiographic Gensini scores were compared among the risk groups. Correlation between serum hs-CRP levels and angiographic Gensini scores was also assessed.\nContext 4: To evaluate the ability of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to predict the need of coronary revascularization in symptomatic patients with stable angina who were referred to a cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary revascularization.\nContext 5: Coronary CT angiography was performed in 1,653 patients (1,089 men, 564 women) without a history of coronary heart disease (mean age+/-SD: men, 51.6+/-9.7 years; women, 56.9+/-10.5 years). The most common reasons for the examination were hypercholesterolemia, family history, hypertension, smoking, and atypical chest pain. The coronary tree was divided into 16 segments; four different methods were used to quantify the amount of atherosclerotic plaque or the degree of stenosis in each segment, and segment scores were combined to give total scores. Framingham risk estimates and NCEP risk categories were calculated for each patient.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below.\n\nThe study included 80 patients subjected to coronary angiography. The extent of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) was assessed using Gensini score.

However, we have encountered patients with such symptoms and excessive tachycardia but with no symptoms during the tilt-table test (TTT). We aimed to investigate whether POTS patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance always present orthostatic symptoms during the TTT and analyze the factors underlying symptom manifestation during this test.\nContext 2: To determine if several multisystem comorbid conditions occur more frequently in subjects with tilt-table defined postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) compared with those without.\nContext 3: In 22 patients, 7 patients (31.8%) did not present orthostatic symptoms during the test. Diastolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly lower in the symptom-positive group. The head-up tilt resulted in a significant increase in diastolic BP in the symptom-negative group (P=0.04), while systolic BP had a tendency to decrease in the symptom-positive group (P=0.06).\nContext 4: The head-up tilt test gave positive results in 117 patients (74%). The heart rate was 68.7 (11.3) bpm in the decubitus position and 85.1 (15.4) bpm during the first 6 min of tilting. There was strong inverse correlation between the heart rate increase induced by tilting and age (r=--0.63; P<.001), but the increase (16.8 [9.3] bpm in patients with syncope versus 14.9 [11.3] bpm in those without; P=.3) did not predict the result of the test. The heart rate increase induced by nitroglycerin was also similar for patients with and without syncope during the pharmacologic phase of the test (27.3 [12.6] bpm and 26.7 (13.4) bpm, respectively; P=.8).\nContext 5: The magnitude of the change in heart rate during the first few minutes of the head-up tilt test has been used to predict the test's result. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the heart rate increase during the head-up tilt test potentiated with nitroglycerin is related to the development of syncope.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a rationale for your answer.\n1. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the results of the study?\nA. The heart rate increase induced by tilting is a reliable predictor of the test's result.\nB. The heart rate increase induced by tilting is not a reliable predictor of the test's result.\nC. The heart rate increase induced by tilting is not related to the development of syncope.\nD. The heart rate increase induced by tilting is related to the development of syncope.\n2. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the results of the study?\nA.

Gene expression analysis of nuclear receptors revealed that the basal and inducibility of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) expression positively correlate with the susceptibility of HCC cells to fenretinide treatment. Furthermore, fenretinide transactivates the RXRalpha/RARbeta-mediated pathway and directly increases the transcriptional activity of RARbeta. Knockdown of RARbeta mRNA expression significantly impairs fenretinide-induced apoptosis in Huh-7 cells.\nContext 3: As tested by colony-forming cell assays using clinical specimens, both number and size of total colonies derived from CD34(+) CML cells were significantly reduced by fenretinide, and by combining fenretinide with imatinib. In particular, colonies derived from erythroid progenitors and more primitive pluripotent/multipotent progenitors were highly sensitive to fenretinide/fenretinide plus imatinib. Accordantly, fenretinide appeared to induce apoptosis in CD34(+) CML cells, particularly with regard to the cells in the subpopulation of CD34(+)CD38(-). Through cell quiescent assays, including Ki-67 negativity test, we added evidence that nonproliferative CD34(+) CML cells were largely eliminated by fenretinide. Transcriptome and molecular data further showed that mechanisms underlying the apoptosis in CD34(+) CML cells were highly complex, involving multiple events of oxidative stress responses.\nContext 4: almost all human malignant haematological cell lines studied here expressed the five SSTRs. Further experiments were conducted on the human U266 multiple myeloma cells, which express also micro-opioid receptors (MOP-R). XTT assays and cell cycle studies provide no evidence for a significant effect upon opioid or somatostatin receptors stimulation. Furthermore, neither direct effect nor potentiation of the Fas-receptor pathway was detected on apoptosis after these treatments.\nContext 5: The intensive interactions of myeloma cells (multiple myeloma, MM) with the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) are crucial for the development of MM. The BMME is composed of stromal cells, which are the main source of cytokines and growth factors that regulate MM cell growth and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fenretinide on the BMME and MM cells.\nContext 6: Fenretinide is a synthetic retinoid that has been used in the treatment of breast cancer and other cancers. Fenretinide is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme retinoid X receptor (RXR) and is a potent inducer of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR) family of nuclear receptors.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) has been shown to have activity against a broad spectrum of cancers. In order to enhance its tissue-specific delivery and anticancer activity, we prepared HCPT-loaded nanoparticles made from poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PEG-PBLG), and then studied their release characteristics, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and anticancer effects. PEG-PBLG nanoparticles incorporating HCPT were prepared by a dialysis method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the shape and diameter of the nanoparticles. The HCPT release characteristics in vitro were evaluated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection method for determining HCPT in rabbit plasma was established. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HCPT/PEG-PBLG nanoparticles were compared with those of HCPT.\nContext 2: In previous research, we found that 10-methoxy-9-nitrocamptothecin (MONCPT) possessed potent anti-tumor activity in A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, our purpose is to investigate the mechanism of MONCPT-induced cell cycle arrest in A549 cells.\nContext 3: By using wild-type and Abcb1; Abcg2 knockout mice we have investigated the effect of sildenafil on the brain penetration of two substrate drugs (docetaxel and topotecan). Next we have investigated if sildenafil was able to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin against P-glycoprotein expressing CT26 colon cancer cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice.\nContext 4: Sildenafil administered orally at a dose of 50mg/kg did not improve the brain penetration of docetaxel and topotecan, although the plasma level of sildenafil was already much higher than can be achieved in humans. On the other hand, sildenafil increased the plasma levels of the cytotoxic drugs, but not by inhibition of Abcb1 or Abcg2, since this effect was also seen in Abcb1;Abcg2 knockout mice. The brain penetration of sildenafil was more than 20-fold higher in Abcb1;Abcg2 mice versus wild-type mice, indicating that sildenafil is a good substrate of the two transporters. Sildenafil was also not able to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin against subcutaneous CT26 tumours. The doxorubicin level in tumour tissue was not increased by sildenafil, but the tumour growth was reduced. The results suggest that sildenafil is not a good substrate for Abcb1 or Abcg2, but it is a good substrate for P-glycoprotein. The results also suggest that sildenafil is not able to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin against CT26 tumours.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sildenafil on the brain penetration of two substrate drugs (docetaxel and topotecan) in wild-type and Abcb1;Abcg2 knockout mice. Next we have investigated if sildenafil was able to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin against P-glycoprotein expressing CT26 colon cancer cells in sy", "Question: Does changes in hematocrit following a blood transfusion influence the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis : A case-control study??\nExplanation: The study was conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit with liberal transfusion practices. The authors found that a change in hematocrit following a blood transfusion was not associated with the development of necrotizing enterocolitis. The authors concluded that the association between blood transfusion and necrotizing enterocolitis was not due to changes in hematocrit.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Hypertension has been repeatedly linked to renal cell cancer, independent of overweight and anti-hypertensive drug use, but its role remains unclear, especially within the growing group of relatively young-middle aged renal cancer patients. In order to delineate the role of hypertension in early onset renal cancer, we examined the association of blood pressure measured at age 17 with the incidence of renal cancer.\nContext 2: Sociodemographic and medical data of 918,965 adolescent males examined for fitness for military service from 1967 to 2005 were linked to the National Cancer Registry in this nationwide population-based cohort study (12,910,585 person years) to obtain cancer incidence. A single measurement of blood pressure at age 17 was stratified as optimal (<120/80), normal (\u2265 120/80 < 130/85), high normal (\u2265 130/85 < 140/90), or high (\u2265 140/90). We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate the hazard ratio of the blood pressure categories for renal cancer, adjusted for year of birth, body mass index, origin of parents, and height. We also assessed the role of a clinical diagnosis of persistent hypertension (n = 4223, based on multiple measurements).\nContext 3: Of those who had their blood pressure recorded, 90 examinees developed renal cancer. In a multivariable model, the higher categories of blood pressure were associated with a decreased risk of renal cancer (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.84; P =.021 for blood pressure \u2265 140/90 vs < 120/80). Furthermore, there was no evidence of increased risk for those with an established diagnosis of hypertension (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.17-9.50; P =.81).\nContext 4: Clinical manifestations of renal dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors include hypertension, proteinuria, tubulopathy (and its biochemical consequences) and renal insufficiency. This study aimed to determine the factors associated with renal dysfunction in paediatric cancer survivors at a single centre in Johannesburg.\nContext 5: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a central role in promoting angiogenesis and is over-expressed in renal cell cancer (RCC). Published data on the association between polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor (e.g., -2578C/A, -1155G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -2518G/A, -2578G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -2518G/A, -2578G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -2518G/A, -2578G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -2518G/A, -2578G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -2518G/A, -2578G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -2518G/A, -2578G/A, -936C/T, -634G/A, -", "Contexts:\nContext 1: MTT assays indicated that increasing concentrations of DHADA and EPADA significantly affected viability in MCF-7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas no effect was observed in MCF-10A non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cells. DHADA and EPADA enhanced Beclin-1 expression, as evidenced by immunoblotting, real-time-PCR and functional analyses. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Re-ChIP assays revealed that both compounds induced recruitment of Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated-Receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and RNA Polymerase-II at the Retinoic-X-Receptor binding region on Beclin-1 promoter. Moreover, both compounds enhanced autophagosome formation, evaluated by LC-3 and monodansylcadaverine labeling, that was prevented by the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662, addressing the direct involvement of PPAR\u03b3. Noteworthy, long-term treatment with DHADA and EPADA caused the blockade of autophagic flux followed by apoptotic cell death as evidenced by PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation in all breast cancer cells.\nContext 2: The omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may form conjugates with amines that have potential health benefits against common diseases including cancers. Here we synthesized DHA-dopamine (DHADA) and EPA-dopamine (EPADA) conjugates and studied their biological effects on different breast cancer cell lines.\nContext 3: We investigate the roles of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and p53 in mediating the induction of autophagy in human tumor cells after exposure to 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a chemotherapy drug recognized by MMR. We also examine how activation of autophagy affects apoptosis (type I cell death) after MMR processing of 6-TG.\nContext 4: DHQ3 and 17-DR presented efficiently inhibitory effect in MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and DHQ3 induced necroptosis by activation of the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL necroptosis cascade. And DHQ3-induced cell death was inhibited by a necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), but not by a caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. On the other hand, 17-DR induced cell death by activation of the mitochondrial pathway, and Nec-1 and z-VAD-fmk did not affect 17-DR-induced cell death. Moreover, 17-DR induced autophagy and inhibited the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II, but not the expression of p62. In addition, 17-DR induced the expression of p53 and p21, and the expression of p53 and p21 was inhibited by Nec-1 and z-VAD-fmk. These results suggest that 17-DR induces necroptosis and autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells, and that 17-DR-induced necroptosis and autophagy", "Yes, rapid multiplexed phenotypic screening identifies drug resistance functions for three novel efflux pumps in Acinetobacter baumannii.\nThe following is a summary of the evidence that supports your answer.\n    - Rapid multiplexed phenotypic screening is a high-throughput screening technique that identifies phenotypes for putative efflux systems encoded by the human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.\n    - Phenotypes were confirmed for two pumps and novel drug resistance phenotypes were identified for three new A. baumannii drug transporters, which exemplified the power of this method as a high-throughput screening technique.\n    - One of the phenotypically characterized putative drug efflux systems was classified", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Perception of sleep-wake times may differ from objective measures, although the mechanisms remain elusive. Quantifying the misperception phenotype involves two operational challenges: defining objective sleep latency and treating sleep latency and total sleep time as independent factors. We evaluated a novel approach to address these challenges and test the hypothesis that sleep fragmentation underlies misperception.\nContext 2: The stage content of SDSL is related to latency misperception, but in the opposite manner as our hypothesis: those with > 20 minutes of SDSL had less N1%, more N3%, and lower transition frequency. After adjusting for misperceived sleep during subjective sleep latency, TST misperception was greater in those with longer bouts of REM and N2 stages (OSA patients) as well as N3 (non-OSA patients), which also did not support our hypothesis.\nContext 3: We performed a retrospective analysis on patients with or without obstructive sleep apnea during overnight diagnostic polysomnography in our laboratory (n = 391; n = 252). We compared subjective and objective sleep-wake durations to characterize misperception. We introduce a new metric, sleep during subjective latency (SDSL), which captures latency misperception without defining objective sleep latency and allows correction for latency misperception when assessing total sleep time (TST) misperception.\nContext 4: Sleep fragmentation was associated with an increase in the arousal index, percentage of sleep stage 1, and frequency of stage shifts. In addition, there was a decrease in sleep latency and in percentage of slow-wave sleep. Moreover, a significant increase in heart rate variability and especially of its sympathetic component, was also found. In contrast, parameters of the leg movement activity showed no significant change following experimental sleep fragmentation. The lack of an increase in leg movement activity was also observed in one subject who demonstrated PLMS at baseline.\nContext 5: On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality (M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (\u03b2 = -.18, p < 0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (\u03b2 = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no.\n\nYes\nNo\n\nContext 1: Perception of sleep-wake times may differ from objective measures, although the mechanisms remain elusive.

The overall rate of pancreatitis was 7.9% (22/278). There was no significant difference in the rate (8.0% [11/137] vs 7.8% [11/141], P =.944) and severity of post-ERCP pancreatitis between the udenafil and placebo groups. Severe pancreatitis developed in 1 patient in the placebo group. On both univariate and multivariate analyses, age 40 years or younger, suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, complete pancreatic duct opacification, and failed cannulation were associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis. Only mild udenafil-related complications occurred, including flushing (n = 3) and headache (n = 3).\nContext 3: Six randomized controlled trials involving 2,448 patients were identified. The analysis showed that corticosteroids did not prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis (OR 1.13: 95% CI [0.88, 1.46]). Subsequent sensitivity and subgroup analyses according to different criteria all confirmed these results.\nContext 4: Patients at increased risk for acute post-ERCP pancreatitis based on assessment of known risk factors were randomized to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (Certoparin 3000 IU subcutaneously) or placebo (saline solution 0.3 mL subcutaneously) the day before ERCP. The drug was given 2 hours before and 22 hours after ERCP. Documentation and follow-up included patient history, risk factors for acute post-ERCP pancreatitis, procedure-related data, assessment of pain (visual analogue scale, need for pain medication), laboratory findings before and after ERCP (0, 4, and 24 hours), as well as post-ERCP complications. The two-sided Fisher exact test was used for statistical comparison, and a p value < or =0.05 was considered significant.\nContext 5: A total of 249 patients were included in the analysis. The two groups were matched for age, gender, underlying disease and indication for treatment, ERCP findings, and type of treatment. The overall incidence of post-ERCP acute pancreatitis was 10.8%, with 12.1% in the heparin group and 9.9% in the control group (p =.55). The incidence of severe acute pancreatitis was 2.4% in the heparin group and 1.9% in the control group (p =.74). The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis was 2.4% in the heparin group and 1.9% in the control group (p =.74).

There was no evidence of retinal detachment associated with the cataracts at initial presentation. Phacoemulsification was performed on 34 eyes (20 dogs). Clinically evident lens-induced uveitis was treated preoperatively in 17/34 eyes. Artificial lens implantation was carried out in 30/34 eyes; automated anterior vitrectomy was performed in 7/34 eyes. The mean follow-up time was 16.6 months (range 1.5-73 months). At the last re-examination, 31/34 eyes (91.2%) were visual. Three eyes (8.8%) were blind--two (in the same dog) because of presumptive bilateral optic nerve disease and one because of uveitis and secondary glaucoma. There was no evidence of retinal detachment following phacoemulsification in any of the 34 eyes.\nContext 4: Retinal, choroidal and scleral thickness were measured using A-scan ultrasonography in normal White Leghorn chicks (n=\u2003891) aged 4 days old, and again (n=498) after 4 days of monocular form-deprivation at age 8 days of age. Refractive error was assessed by retinoscopy. Relationships between pre-treatment choroidal thickness and other variables were investigated using general linear models and variance components analysis.\nContext 5: The anatomic reattachment rate was 93.3% after 1 procedure and 100% at the 6-month visit. Mean preoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 (range, 20/400 to 20/25) and mean postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 (range, 20/100 to 20/20). In 1 case the retina redetached at the second procedure. The anatomic reattachment rate was 100% at the 6-month visit.\nContext 6: The anatomic reattachment rate was 100% at the 6-month visit.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of intravascular ultrasound for the prediction of severe dissections by pre-interventional analysis of lesion morphology and plaque composition.\nWe retrospectively investigated serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) findings in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess the effect of enteral feeding with human milk on the time from initiation of feeds to discharge after gastroschisis repair through review of a multi-institutional database.\nContext 2: Infants who underwent gastroschisis repair between 1997 and 2012 with data recorded in the Pediatrix Medical Group Clinical Data Warehouse were categorized into 4 groups based on the percentage of days fed human milk out of the number of days fed enterally. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to determine the adjusted effect of human milk on the time from initiation of feeds to discharge.\nContext 3: Among 3082 infants, 659 (21%) were fed human milk on 0% of enteral feeding days, 766 (25%) were fed human milk on 1%-50% of enteral feeding days, 725 (24%) were fed human milk on 51%-99% of enteral feeding days, and 932 (30%) were fed human milk on 100% of enteral feeding days. Following adjustment, being fed human milk on 0% of enteral feeding days was associated with a significantly increased time to discharge compared with being fed human milk on 100% of enteral feeding days (hazard ratio [HR] for discharge per day, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.40-0.52). The same was found for infants fed human milk on 1%-50% of enteral feeding days (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.32-0.41) and for infants fed human milk on 51%-99% of enteral feeding days (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.46-0.57).\nContext 4: A degree of feed intolerance after neonatal abdominal surgery is common but in an otherwise well baby enteral feeding usually is continued at the highest tolerated level. However, the presence of rectal bleeding, pneumatosis intestinalis, or portal vein gas seen on plain abdominal x-rays suggest the possibility of postoperative necrotising enterocolitis. When this happens feedings usually are stopped for 7 to 10 days, and intravenous antibiotics and total parental nutrition are commenced.\nContext 5: Although gastroschisis infants usually have a good outcome, there remains a cohort of babies who fare poorly. We inquired whether the presence of bowel dilatation in utero is predictive of poor outcome.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in infants with gastroschisis and to determine whether the presence of bowel dilatation in utero is predictive of poor outcome.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in infants with gastroschisis and to determine whether the presence of bowel dilatation in utero is predictive of poor outcome.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in infants with gastroschisis and to determine whether the presence of bowel dilat", "Question: Does cryopreservation time decrease follicular viability in ovarian tissue frozen for fertility preservation??\nYes, the answer is yes. The study showed that the viability of ovarian tissue cryopreserved for 6 months was significantly lower than that of fresh tissue. The authors concluded that the cryopreservation time should be limited to 6 months to preserve the viability of ovarian tissue for fertility preservation.\nThe study was conducted in 2012 by the following authors:\n1.

There is an ongoing debate about whether inhalation or transdermal resorption of sanitizer ethanol is the underlying cause for positive EtG findings after hand disinfection.\nContext 2: Desderman(\u00ae) pure (Sch\u00fclke & Mayr GmbH, Norderstedt) with 78.2g 96% (v/v) ethanol/100g and approx. 10% 2-propanol was used for multiple hand disinfection without and under an exhauster. Simulating a common working day in a clinic, 5 co-workers of our lab used the sanitizer 32 fold within 8h and 2 persons were merely exposed to the sanitizer vapor but without any dermal sanitizer contact. Any additional ethanol intake or exposition was reliably excluded. Spot urine was collected at baseline, after 1, 2, 4, 6 \u2026 14, and finally 24h after the first sanitizer use. A validated LC-MS/MS was used for MRM and MS(3) of EtG and qualitative analyses of ethyl sulfate and 2-propyl glucuronide.\nContext 3: Multiple hand disinfection caused positive EtG findings of up to 2.1mg/L or 1.7mg/g creatinine in 4 out of 5 test persons and even of 0.6mg/L or 0.8mg/g for 2 controls which were merely exposed to the sanitizer vapor but without any sanitizer contact. EtG results between the clinical (0.5mg/g) and the forensic (0.1mg/g) cut-off were obtained even 6h after the last sanitizer exposition. An exhauster prevented the sanitizer vapor inhalation and reduced the EtG excretion to mostly below the detection limit of 0.02mg/g. The maximum value was 0.09mg/g. Ethyl sulfate and 2-propyl glucuronide (2-PpG) were detectable only in the EtG positive samples. 2-PpG is a metabolite of 2-propanol, which is quite frequently used in disinfectants. Thus, the detection of this substance can be used in cases of odd EtG results as an indicator of (unintended) sanitizer exposition.\nContext 4: Ethyl Glucoronide (EtG) and Ethyl Sulfate (EtS) are the main metabolites of ethanol in urine. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is a useful indicator of recent ethanol consumption. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is higher in the first 24h after ethanol consumption. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is lower in the first 24h after sanitizer exposure. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is higher in the first 24h after sanitizer exposure. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is higher in the first 24h after sanitizer exposure. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is higher in the first 24h after sanitizer exposure. The EtG/2-PpG ratio is higher in the first", "Question: Are sun exposure and vitamin D independent risk factors for CNS demyelination??\nExplanation: Sun exposure and vitamin D status are independent risk factors for CNS demyelination. Sun exposure is associated with a higher risk of developing MS, and vitamin D status is associated with a lower risk of developing MS. The relationship between vitamin D and MS is complex and not fully understood. Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that is synthesized in the skin and is also found in the blood and in the brain. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for the maintenance of normal bone health. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin from cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. The skin synthesizes vitamin D", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Eighteen adult patients with severe contusional traumatic brain injury, on computerized tomography, were identified. Patients with diffuse injuries or extradural and subdural hematomas associated with mass effect were not included in the study. Daily serum samples were taken for the measurement of IL-8 and MCP-1 concentrations for up to 11 days postinjury.\nContext 2: In the patients who died while in intensive care, IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly greater than in those patients discharged (18 [0-202] vs. 0 [0-156] pg/mL and 498 [339-1,063] vs. 368 [86-11,289] pg/mL for IL-8 and MCP-1, respectively). No difference was seen in serum chemokine levels in patients who deteriorated with contusion enlargement compared with those that did not. The IL-8 and MCP-1 concentrations did not change significantly over time either in the group as a whole or in the subgroup of patients who deteriorated.\nContext 3: Although many previous studies have indicated that the acute inflammatory response following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is detrimental, inflammation may also positively influence outcome in the more chronic post-injury recovery period. We evaluated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (mAB), neutralizing either IL-6 (IL-6 mAB) or TNF-alpha (TNF mAB), administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v) on acute neurobehavioral outcome following TBI.\nContext 4: Cerebral contusions contain numerous leukocytes, and a temporal relationship exists among cerebral chemokine expression, leukocyte recruitment, and contusion enlargement. This would suggest a role for chemokines in contusion development. However, it has not been established if serum concentrations of chemokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) change with contusion enlargement.\nContext 5: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), calpain and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) are reported to participate in inflammatory reactions in pathological conditions and are involved in traumatic brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate whether PARP participated in inflammation related to calpain and NF-\u03baB in a mouse model of controlled cortical impact (CCI).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n    - What is the purpose of this study?\n    - What is the hypothesis of this study?\n    - What is the null hypothesis of this study?\n    - What is the experimental design of this study?\n    - What is the purpose of the first part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of the second part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of the third part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of the fourth part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of the fifth part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of the sixth part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of the seventh part of the study?\n    - What is the purpose of", "Question: Are [ Newly formed French residents in pediatrics well prepared for conducting pediatric resuscitation after medical school ]?\nYes, they are well prepared.

IMR is higher in northern India as compared with south Indian states like Kerala. Any further reduction in IMR needs identification of new strategies. The Ballabgarh project with an IMR of 36 in 1997 can help identify such strategies.\nContext 2: To see the trend in reduction of neonatal mortality rate (NNMR) and IMR at the Ballabgarh project, compare it with Kerala and rural India's trend and look at", "Contexts:\nContext 1: By using cDNA microarray analysis, we identified a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR39, that is significantly up-regulated in ESCC. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of GPR39 in human esophageal cancer development, and to examine the prevalence and clinical significance of GPR39 overexpression in ESCC.\nContext 2: The mRNA expression level of GPR39 was analyzed in 9 ESCC cell lines and 50 primary ESCC tumors using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess GPR39 protein expression in tissue arrays containing 300 primary ESCC cases. In vitro and in vivo studies were done to elucidate the tumorigenic role of GPR39 in ESCC cells.\nContext 3: Rad51 plays a critical role in homologous recombination and correlates with many human malignancies. However, its role and clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to explore the clinicopathological correlation and prognostic significance of Rad51 expression in a group of ESCC patients.\nContext 4: We found that GPR39 was frequently overexpressed in primary ESCCs in both mRNA level (27/50, 54%) and protein level (121/207, 58.5%), which was significantly associated with the lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage (P < 0.01). Functional studies showed that GPR39 has a strong tumorigenic ability. Introduction of GPR39 gene into ESCC cell line KYSE30 could promote cell proliferation, increase foci formation, colony formation in soft agar, and tumor formation in nude mice. The mechanism by which amplified GPR39 induces tumorigenesis was associated with its role in promoting G1/S transition via up-regulation of cyclin D1 and CDK6. Further study found GPR39 could enhance cell motility and invasiveness by inducing EMT and remodeling cytoskeleton. Moreover, depletion of endogenous GPR39 by siRNA could effectively decrease the oncogenicity of ESCC cells.\nContext 5: To assess the status of EGFR, HER-2, and CCND1 at the gene and protein levels in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using the information in the contexts above.\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n## Expert Answer\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n###### Did you like this example?\n\n### You might be interested in\n\n    - A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of progressive dysphagia and weight loss.

Blood samples were taken from ventilated infants at birth, before surfactant treatment, at 1 and 2 hours after surfactant, and at 12 to 24 hours of age. Blood samples were taken from control infants at birth, at 2 to 6 hours, and at 12 to 24 hours of age. Phagocyte CD11b expression was analyzed by flow cytometry.\nContext 2: In preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), circulating neutrophils are activated. Kinetics and effects of surfactant therapy on this activation are unknown. Therefore, we studied activation of circulating neutrophils and monocytes in newborn preterm infants with and without RDS.\nContext 3: The etiology of persistent lung inflammation in preterm infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) is poorly characterized, hampering efforts to stratify prognosis and treatment. Airway macrophages are important innate immune cells with roles in both the induction and resolution of tissue inflammation.\nContext 4: In ventilated infants, phagocyte CD11b expression increased from birth to the first postnatal samples. It increased further by 12 to 24 hours of age. Control infants with or without nasal continuous positive airway pressure showed no significant increase after birth. At 12 to 24 hours of age, phagocyte CD11b expression was higher in ventilated infants than in control infants. In ventilated infants, neutrophil CD11b expression at 1 and 2 hours after surfactant correlated positively with gestational age.\nContext 5: Preterm birth was associated with an increase in the proportion of non-classical CD14(+)/CD16(+) monocytes on the day of delivery (58.9 \u00b1 5.8% of total mononuclear cells in preterm vs 33.5 \u00b1 5.8% in term infants, P < 0.001). The proportion of non-classical CD14(+)/CD16(+) monocytes was higher in preterm infants with RDS (59.1 \u00b1 5.8%) than in preterm infants without RDS (33.5 \u00b1 5.8%, P < 0.001). The proportion of non-classical CD14(+)/CD16(+) monocytes was higher in preterm infants with CLD (59.1 \u00b1 5.8%) than in preterm infants without CLD (33.5 \u00b1 5.8%, P < 0.001).

The risk of adverse events in autologous blood donors with cardiac disease is not necessarily caused by blood donation.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The objective was to test the inhibitory effect of dietary calcium, in Western diets with high and low phytate content, on zinc absorption.\nContext 2: Although calcium inhibits zinc bioavailability in rats, especially from high-phytate diets, the effect of calcium on zinc absorption by humans from practical diets remains unclear.\nContext 3: Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, zinc absorption was determined in 10 healthy women from 1-d diets with moderate and high calcium contents of approximately 700 and 1800 mg/d and low and high phytate contents of approximately 440 and 1800 mg/d. Absorption was measured by using extrinsically added (65)Zn and subsequent whole-body scintillation counting.\nContext 4: Mean (+/-SE) fractional zinc absorption was 32.8 +/- 2.3% from the moderate-calcium, low-phytate diet; 26.9 +/- 2.4% from the moderate-calcium, high-phytate diet; 39.4 +/- 2.4% from the high-calcium, low-phytate diet; and 26.2 +/- 2.3% from the high-calcium, high-phytate diet. The respective values for absolute zinc absorption were 3.8 +/- 0.3, 3.0 +/- 0.3, 4.5 +/- 0.3, and 3.2 +/- 0.3 mg/d. Phytate significantly reduced fractional zinc absorption by approximately 10 percentage points and reduced absolute zinc absorption by 25%, or approximately 1 mg/d. Differences in dietary calcium did not affect zinc absorption, regardless of a high or low dietary phytate content.\nContext 5: Children had a mean height-for-age Z-score of -3.3, and consumed animal source foods \u2264twice per month. Their habitual diet contained a phytate:zinc molar ratio of 34:1. Children avidly consumed the RS without complaints. EFZ was 0.8\u00b10.4mg/d (mean\u00b1SD) both before and after the intervention. Fractional absorption of zinc was 0.38\u00b10.08 and 0.35\u00b10.06 before and after the RS intervention respectively. NAZ was 1.1\u00b10.5 and 0.6\u00b10.7 before and after the RS intervention respectively. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d. The mean daily intake of zinc was 0.8\u00b10.2mg/d.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Self-assembly of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, synthetic molecules capable of inhibiting Abeta self-assembly could serve as therapeutic agents and endogenous molecules that modulate Abeta self-assembly may influence disease progression. However, increasing evidence implicating a principal pathogenic role for small soluble Abeta aggregates warns that inhibition at intermediate stages of Abeta self-assembly may prove detrimental. Here, we explore the inhibition of Abeta1-40 self-assembly by serum albumin, the most abundant plasma protein, and the influence of this inhibition on Abeta1-40 activation of endothelial cells for monocyte adhesion.\nContext 2: It is demonstrated that serum albumin is capable of inhibiting in a dose-dependent manner both the formation of Abeta1-40 aggregates from monomeric peptide and the ongoing growth of Abeta1-40 fibrils. Inhibition of fibrillar Abeta1-40 aggregate growth is observed at substoichiometric concentrations, suggesting that serum albumin recognizes aggregated forms of the peptide to prevent monomer addition. Inhibition of Abeta1-40 monomer aggregation is observed down to stoichiometric ratios with partial inhibition leading to an increase in the population of small soluble aggregates. Such partial inhibition of Abeta1-40 aggregation leads to an increase in the ability of resulting aggregates to activate endothelial cells for adhesion of monocytes. In contrast, Abeta1-40 activation of endothelial cells for monocyte adhesion is reduced when more complete inhibition is observed.\nContext 3: Accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide in the brain is thought to play a key pathological role in Alzheimer's disease. Many pharmacological targets have therefore been proposed based upon the biochemistry of A\u03b2, but not all are equally tractable for drug discovery.\nContext 4: Arterial blood flow, arterial and venous blood pressures, total vascular resistance, tissue volume changes, capillary filtration coefficient, and plasma volume were measured before and during the colloid infusion. According to the Starling fluid equilibrium, the ratio between the reflection coefficients for albumin on two occasions (before and after infusion of the synthetic colloid) can be calculated from the maximum osmotic absorption rates induced by a fixed intravenous bolus infusion of albumin and from the capillary filtration coefficients. Obtained data were adjusted for different plasma volume at the two occasions. The ratio between the reflection coefficients was found to be 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 SD) before and 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 after the infusion of the synthetic colloid. The ratio between the reflection coefficients was found to be 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 SD) before and 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 after the infusion of the synthetic colloid. The ratio between the reflection coefficients was found to be 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 SD) before and 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 after the infusion of the synthetic colloid. The ratio between the reflection coefficients was found to be 0.8 \u00b1 0", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are reported to have protective effects on various cells but it is unclear how DPP-4 inhibitors have cardioprotective effects. Our aim was to study the mechanisms of cardioprotective effects by DPP-4 inhibition.\nContext 2: C57BL/6 mice and DPP-4 knockout (DPP-4KO) mice were subjected to left coronary artery ligation to produce acute myocardial infarction (MI). C57BL/6 mice were then treated with vehicle or DPP-4 inhibitor. Left ventricular function, infarct size, the number of vessels, and myocardial ischemia were assessed at 5days after MI. The treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor significantly improved cardiac function and decreased the infarct size. DPP-4 inhibitor increased the ratio of endothelial cell numbers to a cardiomyocyte. The extent of myocardial ischemia and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the border area were significantly decreased by DPP-4 inhibitor. Stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) level in myocardium was significantly increased by DPP-4 inhibitor. Those cardioprotective effects after MI were also recognized in DPP-4KO mice. DPP-4 protein was expressed on rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and DPP-4 inhibitor significantly reduced hypoxia-induced apoptosis in the cardiomyocytes. However, this effect was abolished by the pretreatment with a CXCR4 antagonist or a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor. The beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitor on heart failure after MI were abolished by cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of STAT3.\nContext 3: Several studies suggest that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy benefit less from cardiac resynchronization therapy. In a novel animal model of dyssynchronous ischemic cardiomyopathy, we investigated the extent to which the presence of infarction influences the short-term efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy.\nContext 4: IS was 47 \u00b1 2% (n = 7-8 per group) in control animals (CON). DES-SWOP reduced myocardial infarct size to 23 \u00b1 4%* (*P < 0.05 vs. CON). AG-490 alone did not affect myocardial infarct size (44 \u00b1 7%), but abolished the beneficial effect of DES-SWOP (23 \u00b1 4%). The beneficial effect of DES-SWOP was abolished by the co-administration of AG-490 (23 \u00b1 4%). The beneficial effect of DES-SWOP was also abolished by the co-administration of AG-490 (23 \u00b1 4%).

This is likely due to the shorter time interval between the decision to transfer and the actual departure time. The time interval between the decision to transfer and the actual departure time was shorter for patients transferred by land from all sites studied (mean 41.3 versus 89.7 minutes, p < 0.001). The travel time was shorter by helicopter from all sites (mean 58.4 versus 78.9 minutes, p < 0.001).

It is important to assess whether beta AR antagonists might protect the heart and improve ventricular function in this scenario. The authors therefore used esmolol (an ultra-short-acting beta AR antagonist) to determine whether beta AR antagonist treatment improves left ventricular function in a canine model of acute reversible coronary ischemia followed by coronary reperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The authors also tested whether the mechanism includes preserved beta AR signaling.\nContext 2: Esmolol infusion did not cause an elevation of arterial lactate levels but reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations vs. the control group (p <.05). Both cardiac output and cardiac efficiency in the esmolol-treated rats were significantly higher throughout the study periods vs. the control group (p <.05).\nContext 3: Esmolol reduced HR in all patients and this was associated with a decrease in Ea (2.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 vs. 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.52\u00a0mmHg\u00a0l(-1)), arterial dP/dt max (1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 vs. 0.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u00a0mmHg\u00a0ms(-1)), and a parallel increase in SV (48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 vs. 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0ml), all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Cardiac output and ejection fraction remained unchanged, whereas norepinephrine requirements were reduced (0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 to 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0kg(-1)\u00a0min(-1), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nContext 4: While beta AR density remained unchanged in each group, isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity decreased 26 +/- 6% in the control group but increased 38 +/- 10% in the esmolol group (pre-CPB to end-CPB, mean +/- SD, P = 0.0001). Left ventricular systolic shortening improved in both groups after release of coronary (LAD) ligature; however, the esmolol group increased to 72 +/- 23% of pre-CPB values (P = 0.0001) vs. 58 +/- 18% in the control group (P = 0.0001).\nContext 5: Esmolol infusion reduced the incidence of post-CPB arrhythmias (P = 0.0001) and improved the incidence of post-CPB ventricular tachycardia (P = 0.0001) vs. the control group. Esmolol infusion also reduced the incidence of post-CPB ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.0001) vs. the control group.\nContext 6: Esmolol infusion reduced the incidence of post-CPB ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.0001", "Question: Is aurora kinase B a predictive factor for the aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy??\nYes, aurora kinase B is a predictive factor for the aggressive recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy.\nAurora kinase B is a chromosome passenger protein kinase that is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis.

Apo E is a protein that is associated with plasma lipoproteins. Apo E polymorphism has been related to significant modifications of lipoprotein profile, as well as to the incidence of different pathologies including cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. Furthermore, it was proposed that apo E polymorphism might be involved in the aging selection process. The APOE gene is located on chromosome 19 and encodes apolipoprotein E (apo E). Apo", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To incorporate C-reactive protein into nomograms estimating survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma.\nContext 2: The cohort included 516 patients with a mean follow up of 1.7\u2009years (SD 1.4\u2009years). One- and 3-year renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality was 8.8% and 13.5%, respectively. Four nomograms were generated using overall mortality and renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality as end-points, two each for pre- and postoperative counseling. The factor with the largest effect on all nomograms was preoperative C-reactive protein. Based on the internal validation with bootstrapping, the concordance indices for renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality in the preoperative nomogram, postoperative nomogram, and the Mayo Clinic stage, size, grade and necrosis score were 0.889, 0.893, and 0.832, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.005 and 0.002 comparing with stage, size, grade and necrosis scores for preoperative or postoperative nomograms). For overall mortality, the preoperative nomogram, postoperative nomogram, and stage, size, grade and necrosis score showed concordance indices of 0.866, 0.897, and 0.828, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.123 and 0.008 compared with stage, size, grade and necrosis score for preoperative or postoperative nomograms).\nContext 3: Patients undergoing surgery for renal cell carcinoma from 2005-2012 were studied retrospectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risks regression models including stage, grade, C-reactive protein levels and presence of metastatic disease were constructed. Outcomes analyzed include overall mortality overall mortality and renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality.\nContext 4: Increasing evidence suggests that the serum-gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) might correlate with tumour development and growth rates in various human cancer types. Thus, we decided to investigate the potential prognostic impact of the preoperatively assessed serum-GGT in a European cohort of patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\nContext 5: We tested the hypothesis that baseline plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with risk of incident cancer in the general population and early death in patients with cancer.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.\nProvide a short answer to the question below.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: LM7, a subline of the SAOS human osteosarcoma cell line with low Fas expression, was selected for its high metastatic potential in an experimental nude mouse model. When transfected with the full-length Fas gene (LM7-Fas), these cells expressed higher levels of Fas than the parental LM7 cells or LM7-neo control-transfected cells. These cells were also more sensitive to Fas-induced cell death than controls. When injected intravenously into nude mice, the LM7-Fas cell line produced a significantly lower incidence of tumor nodules than control cell lines. Lung weight and tumor nodule size were also decreased in those mice injected with LM7-Fas. Levels of Fas were quantified in osteosarcoma lung nodules from 17 patients. Eight samples were Fas negative, whereas the remaining 9 were only weakly positive compared with normal human liver (positive control).\nContext 2: The process of metastasis requires the single tumor cell that seeds the metastatic clone to complete a complex series of steps. Identifying factors responsible for these steps is essential in developing and improving targeted therapy for metastasis. Resistance to receptor-mediated cell death, such as the Fas/Fas ligand pathway, is one mechanism commonly exploited by metastatic cell populations.\nContext 3: Fas (APO-1) induces apoptosis after binding Fas ligand (FasL). Evidence suggests that tumors may use this interaction to evade the host immune response. Fas/FasL expression has not been reported in esophageal cancer. We hypothesized that Fas expression would render esophageal cancer cells susceptible to Fas ligation and that irradiation of the cells would increase Fas expression.\nContext 4: The results indicated that DEX could inhibit osteosarcoma cell proliferation and promote osteosarcoma cell apoptosis through induction of lots of related genes expression at the transcription level.\nContext 5: In the MM mouse model, treatment of MSCs with highly expressed Fas ligand (Fas-L high MSCs) showed remarkable inhibitory effects on MM indenization in terms of extending the mouse survival rate and inhibiting tumor growth, bone resorption in the lumbus and collum femoris, and MM cell metastasis in the lungs and kidneys. In addition, reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of MM cells was observed when co-cultured with Fas-L high MSCs in vitro. Furthermore, mechanistically, Fas-L high MSCs inhibited MM cell proliferation by inducing the expression of p21, p27, and p53, and by increasing the expression of Bax and Bcl-2. In addition, Fas-L high MSCs inhibited MM cell migration and invasion by inducing the expression of E-cadherin and by increasing the expression of p27 and p53. In conclusion, Fas-L high MSCs may be a novel therapeutic agent for MM.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of FasL on the proliferation and apoptosis of human osteosarcoma cells. The results showed that FasL could induce apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells, and the expression of FasL was", "Question: Yes, efflux of potassium ion is an important reason of HL-60 cells apoptosis induced by tachyplesin.\nContext 1: To investigate the role of intercellular potassium in tachyplesin-induced HL-60 cells apoptosis.\nContext 2: The concentration of intercellular potassium reduced in a time-dependent manner in tachyplesin-treated HL-60 cells. In addition, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was tightly coupled with the shrinkage of cell volume. Different caspase inhibitors protected against DNA degradation but did not prevent the loss of HL-60 cell viability induced by tachyplesin. Ba2+, which was a kind of blocker of volume-regulatory K+ channels, increased", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Citrulline increases protein synthesis during refeeding in rodents with short bowel syndrome, aging and malnutrition, and improves nitrogen balance in fed healthy humans. The aim of the current study therefore was to determine whether citrulline had affected protein metabolism in healthy volunteers.\nContext 2: Compared with placebo, oral citrulline supplementation increased plasma citrulline, arginine and ornithine concentrations, but failed to affect albumin, transthyretin, free insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 plasma concentrations, urinary nitrate excretion, or nitrogen balance. Citrulline supplementation did not alter leucine Ra, leucine oxidation, nor whole-body protein synthesis.\nContext 3: In 112 community-dwelling healthy men aged 65-90 y, we quantified resting whole-body [1,2-(13)C(2)]leucine kinetics, muscle mixed protein fractional synthesis rates (FSRs), and muscle proteasome proteolytic enzyme activities after participants consumed for 3 d controlled research meals (0.9-1.1 g protein \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1)) that contained more or less protein than that habitually consumed and that induced alterations in nitrogen balance.\nContext 4: Glutamine and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) are used as nutrition supplements in the treatment of proteocatabolic illness. We hypothesized that simultaneous administration of BCAA and glutamine affects protein metabolism more significantly than separate administration. In the present study, we evaluated their effect on protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, liver, and jejunum of septic rats.\nContext 5: During the glutamine feeding period, the leucine flux and leucine oxidation rate were significantly lower than those in the conventional feeding period. This reflects a reduction in total leucine intake from 80 +/- 11 to 62 +/- 10 micromol/kg per hour. However, there was no significant difference in the net balance of leucine accretion into proteins between these 2 dietary periods, which indicated that enriched glutamine feeding for 48 hours did not result in an immediate whole body protein gain in this group of pediatric patients. In addition, plasma glutamine concentration showed a moderate increase after 48 hours of supplementation but did not reach significance.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, or maybe.\n\nCitrulline increases protein synthesis during refeeding in rodents with short bowel syndrome, aging and malnutrition, and improves nitrogen balance in fed healthy humans.

A lot of evidence underlines that natural substances usually consumed in the diet can have an important role in the prevention of cancer. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative activity of Citrus bergamia (bergamot) juice (BJ) in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.\nContext 2: HepG2 cells were exposed to BJ and then cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation were evaluated.\nContext 3: We postulate that green tea polyphenols regulate TNF-alpha gene expression by modulating NF-KB activation through their inhibition effect on IKB Kinase (IKK) activity and as scavenger of free radicals. Pretreatment of green tea polyphenols reduced oxLDL-induced production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and NF-KB activation in dose dependent manner (p < 0.05). Post hoc comparison test with Mann Whitney between various dosage of green tea polyphenols in inhibition of NF-KB activation showed significant result (p < 0.05).\nContext 4: DHA (1-25 \u03bcmol/L) did not affect the viability of B16F10 cells, but decreased \u03b1-MSH-induced melanin synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. DHA concentration-dependently reduced tyrosinase activity in the cells, but did not affect mushroom tyrosinase activity in a cell-free system. Furthermore, DHA treatment significantly reduced tyrosinase level without affecting microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in the cells. DHA did not activate ERK and Akt in the cells. Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (80 nmol/L) abolished DHA-induced tyrosinase reduction.\nContext 5: Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with TNF-\u03b1 (2.5-10 ng/mL) suppressed Sirt1 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. TNF-\u03b1 (5 ng/mL) resulted in an increase in apoptosis and a reduction in ALP activity in the cells. Overexpression of Sirt1 in the cells significantly attenuated TNF-\u03b1-induced injury through suppressing apoptosis, increasing ALP activity, and increasing the expression of Runx2 and osteocalcin mRNAs. Furthermore, overexpression of Sirt1 in the cells significantly increased the expression of Runx2 and osteocalcin mRNAs.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of green tea polyphenols on the expression of the NF-\u03baB pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The results showed that green tea polyphenols significantly inhibited the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and p50 subunits in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, green tea polyphenols significantly inhibited the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and p50 subunits in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, green tea polyphenols significantly inhibited the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and p50 subunits in a dose-dependent manner.

Allele frequencies were 0.24(208T), 0.38(303G), 0.44(627T), 0.35(676G) and 0.18(927T). The CCR5Delta32 allele frequency was 0.08. The promoter polymorphisms existed in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other and the Delta32. No significant effect of the individual CCR5Delta32 or promoter polymorphisms could be demonstrated with respect to time to treatment failure as defined by virological or immunological parameters (P > or = 0.07). Similarly, when combined CCR5Delta32 and promoter genotypes were analyzed in order to account for linkage disequilibrium, no significant effect was observed on time to virological or immunological failure (P > 0.6).\nContext 2: Natural genetic polymorphisms within the CCR5 gene and promoter have been linked to patterns of HIV-1 clinical disease progression in untreated individuals. The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the influence of the CCR5Delta32 mutation and promoter polymorphisms on virological and immunological treatment outcome in 436 antiretroviral-naive individuals initiating their first therapy, over a mean follow-up time of 22 months.\nContext 3: Genotypes for the CCR5Delta32 and promoter were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of human DNA from plasma, followed by gel electrophoresis for CCR5Delta32 or DNA sequencing for the promoter polymorphisms. Time to virological failure [defined as the second plasma viral load > or = 400 copies HIV-1 RNA/ml) and immunological failure (defined as time to achieve two successive CD4 cell counts below baseline) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methods.\nContext 4: In the presence of elevated hsCRP, IL-6 concentration was higher irrespective of the CCR5 genotype. However, in patients with the CCR5 deletion, TNF-\u03b1 did not differ in the presence/absence of elevated hsCRP and was not correlated with hsCRP levels in carriers of the CCR5\u039432 polymorphism.\nContext 5: To investigate evidence for resistance to HIV-1 infection in patients with the CCR5\u039432 mutation, we analyzed the viral load and the plasma levels of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 in 20 patients with the CCR5\u039432 mutation and 20 healthy controls. The viral load was significantly higher in patients with the CCR5\u039432 mutation than in controls (P = 0.001). The plasma levels of CCR5 and CXCR4 were significantly lower in patients with the CCR5\u039432 mutation than in controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The viral load was significantly correlated with the plasma levels of CCR5 and CXCR4 in patients with the CCR5\u039432", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Thirty-two patients were selected who had developed breast cancer at least 10 years following irradiation for Hodgkin's disease before the age of 45 years. In these patients, the complete open reading frame of the ATM gene was analysed for the presence of germline mutations using the protein truncation test and two mutation-specific tests, followed by genomic sequencing.\nContext 2: Long-term survivors of Hodgkin's disease who received mantle-field irradiation at a young age have a strongly increased risk of developing breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether this increased risk was substantially greater among women heterozygous for a germline mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (ATM).\nContext 3: The successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease has been associated with an increased incidence of secondary malignancies. To investigate whether genetic factors contribute to the development of secondary tumors, we collected family cancer histories and performed mutational analysis of the ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) gene, ATM, in a cohort of Hodgkin's disease survivors with secondary malignancies. ATM was chosen for evaluation because of the increased radiosensitivity of cells derived from AT patients and obligate heterozygotes and the epidemiologic observation that AT carriers are at increased risk for radiation-induced breast cancer.\nContext 4: Seventy-six secondary neoplasms were observed in this cohort of 52 Hodgkin's disease survivors, with 18 patients (35%) developing more than one secondary neoplasm. Positive family histories of cancer were present in 11 (21%) of 52 patients, compared with three (4%) of 68 Hodgkin's disease patients in a comparison cohort who did not develop secondary neoplasms (P =.008; Fisher's exact test). No germline ATM mutations were identified, resulting in an estimated AT carrier frequency in this population of 0% (90% confidence interval, 0% to 4%).\nContext 5: Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN predispose human beings to breast cancer, and genetic and epigenetic alterations of PTEN are also detected in sporadic human breast cancer. Germline Pten mutations in mice lead to the development of a variety of tumors, but mammary carcinomas are infrequently found, especially in mice under the age of six months.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate whether this increased risk was substantially greater among women heterozygous for a germline mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene (ATM).\nThe successful treatment of Hodgkin's disease has been associated with an increased incidence of secondary malignancies.

However, there was no significant change in the body weight of low protein females from 110 to 132 days of life compared with the control females. There was an increase in the rate of the search for reward and reduced the latency of the perception of bitter taste. The exposure, a low protein diet during gestation and lactation, also promoted hypophagy in adult females compared with control animals. The low protein female had increased HFHS diet consumption compared with the control. Undernutrition increased neuronal activation in response to HFHS diet consumption compared with female controls in the amygdala and in the caudate putamen.\nContext 2: Wistar rats were divided into two groups according to the diet offered to the dams during pregnancy and lactation: control female (CF; diet with 17% protein, n=7) and low protein female (LPF; diet with 8% protein, n=7). The following parameters were evaluated: (a) body weight during weaning, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 days of life; (b) standard diet intake from 110 to 132 days of life; (c) fat diet and consumption of simple carbohydrates (HFHS) for 1h at 145 days of life; (d) incentive runway task 60 days after 82 days of life; (e) taste reactivity at 90 days of life; and (f) neuronal activation in the caudate putamen, amygdala, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus under stimulus HFHS at 145 days of life.\nContext 3: Nutritional deficiencies during neural development may lead to irreversible changes, even after nutritional rehabilitation, promoting morphological and functional adaptations of structures involved with various behaviours including feeding behaviour. However, the ability of the exposure low protein diet during gestation and lactation to affect the hedonic component of food intake is still poorly understood, especially in females.\nContext 4: Hypertension and coronary heart disease are programmed by maternal undernutrition in utero. The feeding of low-protein diets to rats during their pregnancy results in higher blood pressure in the offspring from the age of weaning.\nContext 5: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a standard rodent diet with low-normal (0.15%) or high-normal (0.30%) protein content during gestation and lactation. The offspring were then raised on a standard diet. The offspring of the low-protein diet group were heavier at birth and had higher body weights at 30, 60, and 90 days of age than the offspring of the high-protein diet group. The offspring of the low-protein diet group had higher body weights at 30, 60, and 90 days of age than the offspring of the high-protein diet group.

All patients had undergone preoperative CT or magnetic resonance imaging, which was used to assign a clinical stage and size (largest diameter) to each tumor in accordance with the 1997 TNM staging system. Following surgical resection pathological stage, size and tumor grade were determined. Only the 186 patients with clinical T1 tumors were included in this analysis.\nContext 2: Pathological stage has been the most widely used prognosticator for evaluating surgically managed cases of renal cell carcinoma. Minimally invasive surgical approaches are being increasingly used to treat small masses for which traditionally pathological information is lacking (morcellation) or absent (radio frequency ablation or cryoablation). Preoperative cross-sectional imaging by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging has been used to stage renal tumors clinically but it can lead to variances with traditional pathological staging systems, particularly with respect to microscopic invasion beyond the renal capsule. In this study we assessed whether radiographically staged clinical T1 lesions that were pathological T1 behave differently than those that were clinical stage T1 and up staged to pT3a.\nContext 3: The role of nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) showed promise in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC). The disease-specific survival of patients with MRCC was compared according to the type of surgery, NSS (N=45) versus radical nephrectomy (RN) (N=732), in unmatched and matched analyses.\nContext 4: From 1998 to 2003, 381 consecutive patients underwent 391 procedures at our institution for renal cell carcinoma, of which 336 were for organ-confined tumors. The temporal trends in the application of LRN and NSS were assessed relative to the clinical stage.\nContext 5: Partial nephrectomy (PN) via open or minimally invasive (MI) techniques is the referent standard for managing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) whenever possible.

The effect of obesity on severely injured patients, however, remains incompletely defined. We sought to unravel potential physiologic and genomic alterations induced by obesity in severely injured blunt trauma patients.\nContext 3: Two hundred eighty-one (19%) obese patients with available computed tomography scans from 1,510 trauma patients were included. Visceral adiposity included 140 patients, subcutaneous adiposity included 141 patients. The two groups were similar in regards to age, Trauma Injury Severity Score, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. There was no difference (p > 0.05) in proinflammatory biomarkers. Patients with visceral adiposity had similar clinical outcomes including mortality (p = 0.56), adult respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0.69), and infection (0.43).\nContext 4: Univariate analysis of 455 severely injured trauma patients using the National Institutes of Health/World Health Organization body mass index classification system revealed significant increases in morbidity, including longer intensive care unit stays and a greater number of ventilator days, cardiac arrests, episodes of acute renal failure, and patients developing multiple organ failure. Regression modeling identified body mass index class as being independently associated with adverse outcomes and increased morbidity but an inverse relationship with mortality in patients who suffered severe blunt traumatic injury. Initial leukocyte genomic expression patterns between 163 patients in the four different body mass index groupings did not differ; however, analysis of gene differences between body mass index classes occurring over time demonstrated significant changes in 513 probe sets with significant pathway differences being related to cellular metabolism.\nContext 5: A secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of adult trauma patients requiring >48 hours of intensive care unit care over a 55-month period was analyzed. Body fat distribution was determined by radiologist review of computed tomography scans at L1. Concentric freeform regions were defined manually, and area was calculated. Visceral adiposity was defined as subcutaneous fat area: visceral area >1.35 (the median), whereas subcutaneous adiposity was defined as a ratio <1.35. Primary outcomes were mortality and intensive care unit length of stay. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit readmission and intensive care unit mortality. A total of 1,510 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 51 years, and 53% were male. The median Injury Severity Score was 17. The median body mass index was 30. The median visceral adiposity was 0.8 cm ^{2}, and the median subcutaneous adiposity was 1.2 cm ^{2}. The median intensive care unit length of stay was 11 days.

Highly aneuploid tumours and the presence of ascitic fluids are hallmarks of EOC. Two microcephaly-associated proteins, abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein (ASPM) and microcephalin, are involved in mitosis and DNA damage repair. Their expression is deregulated at the RNA level in EOC. Here, ASPM and microcephalin protein expression in primary cultures established from the ascites of patients with EOC was determined and correlated with clinical data to assess their suitability as biomarkers.\nContext 2: Five established ovarian cancer cell lines, cells derived from two benign ovarian ascites samples and 40 primary cultures of EOC derived from ovarian ascites samples were analysed by protein slot blotting and/or immunofluorescence to determine ASPM and microcephalin protein levels and their cellular localisation. Results were correlated with clinico-pathological data.\nContext 3: A statistically significant correlation was identified for ASPM localisation and tumour grade, with high levels of cytoplasmic ASPM correlating with grade 1 tumours. Conversely, cytoplasmic microcephalin was only identified in high-grade tumours. Furthermore, low levels of nuclear microcephalin correlated with reduced patient survival.\nContext 4: Ovarian cancer (OC) ascites consist in a proinflammatory tumor environment that is characterized by the presence of various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. The presence of these inflammatory-related factors in ascites is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. CCL18 is a member of CCL chemokines and its expression has been associated with poor prognosis in some cancers. However, its role in OC progression has not been established. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to elucidate the role of ascites CCL18 in OC progression.\nContext 5: Expression of MICA/B and ULBP2 was detected in 97.6 and 82.9% of ovarian cancer cells, respectively, whereas neither was expressed on normal ovarian epithelium. The expression of MICA/B in ovarian cancer was highly correlated with that of ULBP2. Strong expression of ULBP2 in ovarian cancer cells was correlated with less intraepithelial infiltration of T cells and bad prognoses for patients, suggesting that ULBP2 expression is a prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in ovarian cancer and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters.

Mefloquine was administered to patients in both age groups at a dose of 20mgkg(-1). The steady-state drug concentrations were measured by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography.\nContext 3: All patients had an undetectable mefloquine concentration on day 0. In adults, the plasma mefloquine concentrations ranged from 770 to 2930ngmL(-1) and the erythrocyte concentrations ranged from 2000 to 6030ngmL(-1). In children, plasma mefloquine concentrations ranged from 881 to 3300ngmL(-1) and erythrocyte concentrations ranged from 3000 to 4920ngmL(-1). There was no significant correlation between mefloquine concentrations in the plasma and erythrocytes in either adults or children.\nContext 4: 24.3% of the 121 children had severe falciparum malaria, and their mean haemoglobin was 4.49 g/dl (SD \u00b1 1.69). No significant association was found between the ABO phenotypes and malaria infection (p > 0.05). Blood group A was associated with more severe malaria as compared to the blood group O individuals (Odds ratio = 0.79, p > 0.05); blood group AB (Odds ratio = 0.14, p > 0.05) and also there was a significant difference in severity of malaria between blood group O and blood group B (Odds ratio = 1.28, p > 0.05).\nContext 5: One of the major complications of Plasmodium falciparum infection is cerebral malaria (CM), which causes one million deaths worldwide each year, results in long-term neurological sequelae and the treatment for which is only partially effective. Statins are recognized to have an immunomodulatory action, attenuate sepsis and have a neuroprotective effect.

Of these, 42.1% had no further evaluation. Additional testing included repeat urinalysis (36%), urine culture (15.2%), cytology (10.4%), imaging (22.6% overall: 15.9% computed tomography, 4.3% intravenous pyelography; 2.4% magnetic resonance imaging), and cystoscopy (12.8%). Three subjects with microscopic hematuria (2%) were subsequently found to have bladder cancer during the screening study but were not referred for evaluation based on their hematuria. The source of hematuria was unknown in 65%, infection in 22%, benign prostatic enlargement in 10%, and renal stone disease in 4%, but these results are based on incomplete evaluation since only 12.8% underwent cystoscopy.\nContext 4: Of a total of 4,227 routine urinary samples, 249 with dysmorphic hematuria were selected. The samples were processed according to two techniques: standard method (SM) and concentration technique (CT). The percentages of RBC cast identification according to each method were compared.\nContext 5: We included 15 studies with a total of 1594 patients.

The expression of the major inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, in spinal cords of these SOD1 transgenic (TG) mice were assessed by real time PCR. Mice were then crossed with IL-6(-/-) mice to generate SOD1TG/IL-6(-/-) mice. SOD1 TG/IL-6(-/-) mice (n = 17) were compared with SOD1 TG/IL-6(+/-) mice (n = 18), SOD1 TG/IL-6(+/+) mice (n = 11), WT mice (n = 15), IL-6(+/-) mice (n = 5) and IL-6(-/-) mice (n = 8), with respect to neurological disease severity score, body weight and the survival. We also histologically compared the motor neuron loss in lumber spinal cords and the atrophy of hamstring muscles between these mouse groups.\nContext 4: Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and mutant AR is presumed to act in motoneurons to cause SBMA. However, we found that mice overexpressing wild-type (wt) AR solely in skeletal muscle fibers display the same androgen-dependent disease phenotype as when mutant AR is broadly expressed, challenging the assumptions that only an expanded AR can induce disease and that SBMA is strictly neurogenic. We have previously reported that AR toxicity was ligand dependent in our model, and that very few transgenic (tg) males survived beyond birth.\nContext 5: Presymptomatic electrophysiological tests show great accuracy in differentiating transgenic versus wild-type mice, with the most sensitive parameter being the tibialis anterior compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude. The CMAP amplitude at age 10 weeks correlated significantly with clinical disease onset and survival. Electrophysiological tests increased the sensitivity of the CMAP amplitude to detect disease onset and survival in tg mice. The CMAP amplitude was also significantly lower in tg mice than in wild-type mice. The CMAP amplitude was significantly lower in tg mice than in wild-type mice. The CMAP amplitude was significantly lower in tg mice than in wild-type mice. The CMAP amplitude was significantly lower in tg mice than in wild-type mice.

However, it is controversial whether inflammatory responses are harmful or beneficial to neurons. Because many studies have been performed using cultured microglia and neurons, it has not been possible to assess the influence of multiple cell types and diverse factors that dynamically and continuously change in vivo. Furthermore, behavior of microglia and other inflammatory cells could have been overlooked since most studies have focused on neuronal death. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the precise roles of microglia and brain inflammation in the injured brain, and determine their contribution to neuronal damage in vivo from the onset of injury.\nContext 3: In dogs infused with saline, increases in phagocytes and amoeboid microglia were observed at 1-2 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. The labeling indices for phagocytes and amoeboid microglia peaked at 4 weeks with maximum values of 4.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Astrocyte cell numbers increased from 2-6 weeks following irradiation; increased labeling indices were observed after 2 weeks. An infusion of DFMO significantly suppressed BrdU labeling and delayed the increase in cell numbers for phagocytes and amoeboid microglia. In both treatment groups, the proportion of total BrdU labeling accounted for by phagocytes was maximum 1 week after irradiation and then decreased. The proportion of total BrdU labeling accounted for by amoeboid microglia and astrocytes was zero for 2 weeks and then increased.\nContext 4: We have previously shown that small molecule PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKI) can drastically attenuate radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis if the drug administration starts at the time of radiation during acute inflammation with present but limited effects against acute inflammation. To rule out interactions of the drug with acute inflammation, we investigated here in an interventive trial if a later drug administration start at a time when the acute inflammation has subsided--has also beneficial antifibrotic effects.\nContext 5: QA injury led to comparable striatal neuronal loss and optical density of astro- and microgliosis in the striatum of transgenic and wild-type mice.

This study aims to determine the prognostic value of Smad7 in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nContext 2: Surgical specimens obtained from 71 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were immunohistochemically assessed for Smad7, Ki-67, MMP2, CD34, and Smad4 expression. The relationship between Smad7 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were also evaluated.\nContext 3: Fifty-one of 71 specimens (71.8%) were Smad7 positive and 20 specimens were Smad7 negative. Negative expression of Smad7 correlated with lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis after surgery, and a poor survival rate (P = 0.0004, 0.0044, and 0.0003, respectively). We also found an inverse correlation between the expression of Smad7 and MMP2 (P = 0.0189). Multivariate analysis revealed that Smad7 expression was an independent prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) 0.3902; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1839-0.8277; P = 0.0142]. Furthermore, in both Smad4-negative and Smad4-positive groups, survival of patients with Smad7-positive tumors was significantly better than those with Smad7-negative tumors (both P < 0.0001).\nContext 4: SMAD4 is a gastrointestinal malignancy-specific tumor suppressor gene found mutated in one third of colorectal cancer specimens and half of pancreatic tumors. SMAD4 inactivation by allelic deletion or intragenic mutation mainly occurs in the late stage of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Various studies have proposed potential SMAD4-mediated anti-tumor effects in human malignancy; however, the relevance of SMAD4 in the PDAC molecular phenotype has not yet been fully characterized.\nContext 5: SMAD4 loss is associated with the development of metastases and poor prognosis.

It is not clear whether elevations in donor troponin I levels predict adverse outcomes and should thus preclude acceptance of a donor heart. This study examined whether troponin I levels from donors accepted for pediatric heart transplantation predicted graft failure.\nContext 2: Overall graft survival in 839 heart transplants was 81% at 2 years. At least 1 troponin I level was recorded in 657 donors before transplant, with a median value of 0.1 ng/ml (range, 0-50 ng/ml). Troponin I level and graft status were not correlated (p = 0.74). A receiver operating characteristic curve showed no association between troponin I and graft status (area under the curve, 0.51; p = 0.98). Graft survival did not differ significantly (p = 0.60) among quartiles of troponin I levels (<0.04, 0.04-<0.1, 0.1-<0.35, \u2265 0.35 ng/ml). A troponin I level \u2265 1 ng/ml was found in 74 transplanted donor hearts; graft survival was not associated with troponin I \u2265 1 (80%) vs < 1 (80%) at 2 years (p = 0.93). Troponin I values were not associated with post-transplant hospital length of stay (r = -0.06; p = 0.10).\nContext 3: Deidentified data on heart transplants performed in recipients aged < 21 years between April 2007 and April 2009 was provided by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Donor troponin I level and recipient outcomes, including survival without retransplantation (graft survival), were examined for statistical correlation.\nContext 4: Serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are frequently measured in the evaluation of potential heart donors. However, the utility of cTnI levels for predicting recipient outcomes remains controversial. This study was performed to determine whether donor cardiac cTnI levels exceeding 1.0 microg/liter are associated with adverse recipient outcomes.\nContext 5: A review of the prospective multicenter Pediatric Heart Transplant Study registry identified all patients without CHD in whom a pre-transplant PVRI was recorded.

Obestatin is a peptide hormone derived from the proteolytic cleavage of ghrelin preprohormone. In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), the levels of total ghrelin (TG) and acylated ghrelin (AG) are increased, and these hormones are regulated by insulin. In children with PWS, the insulin secretion is reduced, despite obesity, being ascribed to the growth hormone (GH) deficiency of hypothalamic origin. Besides, an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus was described in this syndrome. Hence, we addressed the questions of how body composition and insulin secretion are interrelated", "Question: Does increased expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mediate mesenchymal stem cells recruitment after vascular injury??\nExplanation: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine that is produced by the bone marrow and is involved in the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. G-CSF is also known to be involved in the mobilization of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow. MSCs are multipotent cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and cardiomyocytes. MSCs have been shown to be involved in the repair of injured tissues, including", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a major regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux and protects cells from excess intracellular cholesterol accumulation; however, the mechanism involved in posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 is poorly understood. We previously showed that microRNA-33 (miR-33) is 1 regulator. Here, we investigated the potential contribution of other microRNAs (miRNAs) to posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 and macrophage cholesterol efflux.\nContext 2: We performed a bioinformatic analysis for identifying miRNA target prediction sites in ABCA1 gene and an unbiased genome-wide screen to identify miRNAs modulated by cholesterol excess in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed that miR-758 is repressed in cholesterol-loaded macrophages. Under physiological conditions, high dietary fat excess in mice repressed miR-758 both in peritoneal macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in the liver. In mouse and human cells in vitro, miR-758 repressed the expression of ABCA1, and conversely, the inhibition of this miRNA by using anti-miR-758 increased ABCA1 expression. In mouse cells, miR-758 reduced cellular cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), and anti-miR-758 increased it. miR-758 directly targets the 3'-untranslated region of Abca1 as assessed by 3'-untranslated region luciferase reporter assays. Interestingly, miR-758 is highly expressed in the brain, where it also targets several genes involved in neurological functions, including Slc38a1, Ntm, Epha7, and Mytl1.\nContext 3: Recent studies highlight a potential role of cholesterol metabolic disturbance in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) gene resides within proximity of linkage peaks on chromosome 9q influence AD and plays a key role in cellular cholesterol efflux in the brain.\nContext 4: The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG1 mediates cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and prevents the progression of macrophage foam-cell formation. Much less is known about the regulatory mechanism of ABCG1, although its physiological importance is becoming clearer. Here, we show that the microRNA miR-758 is a novel regulator of ABCG1 expression. We demonstrate that miR-758 is highly expressed in the brain, where it targets several genes involved in neurological functions, including Slc38a1, Ntm, Epha7, and Mytl1. We also show that miR-758 is highly expressed in the brain, where it targets several genes involved in neurological functions, including Slc38a1, Ntm, Epha7, and Mytl1.

The mean fasting insulin levels of groups II, III, and IV were significantly lower than those of group I (P <.001). 2. Serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in groups III and IV than in group I and II. 3. There were no significant differences", "Question: Does accuracy of a heart failure diagnosis in administrative register??\nContext 1: To study the accuracy of a heart failure diagnosis reported to the Danish National Patient Registers during routine clinical work.\nContext 2: The incidence of heart failure is frequently reported using hospital discharge diagnoses. The specificity of a diagnosis has been shown to be high but the sensitivity of a reported diagnosis is unknown.\nContext 3: A registered diagnosis of heart failure (n=126) carried a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 29% for all patients. The positive predictive value was 81%, the negative predictive value 90%.\nContext 4: The patient population consisted of 3644 consecutive patients admitted to all departments in one hospital. Diagn", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We found no evidence supporting an association between concentrations of tamoxifen or metabolites and either the frequency or severity of hot flashes in the covariate unadjusted analyses. However, including interactions with menopausal status and pre-treatment hot flash (PTHF) history indicated that post-menopausal women with PTHF experienced an increasing frequency of hot flashes with increasing serum concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites. This finding was not altered when adjusting for potential confounding factors (duration of tamoxifen treatment, CYP2D6 phenotype, estradiol serum concentration, age and body mass index). In addition we observed a positive association between body mass index and both hot flash frequency (p = 0.04) and severity (p < 0.0001). We also observed that patients with lower estradiol levels reported more severe hot flashes (p = 0.02).\nContext 2: We investigated in a series of 109 patients whether the frequency and severity of hot flashes were related to concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites. A serum sample of all patients was analyzed for the concentration of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, as well as for estradiol concentrations and several single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2D6. Additionally, these patients completed a questionnaire concerning biometric data and treatment side effects.\nContext 3: Tamoxifen has dramatically reduced the recurrence and mortality rate of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. However, the efficacy of tamoxifen varies between individuals and 40% of patients will have a recurrence despite adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Factors that predict tamoxifen efficacy would be helpful for optimizing treatment. Serum concentrations of the active metabolite, endoxifen, may be positively related to treatment outcome. In addition, hot flashes are suggested to be positively associated with tamoxifen treatment outcome.\nContext 4: Classical hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes is contraindicated in breast cancer especially in endocrine responsive disease.\nContext 5: In a double-blind, randomized phase III study, breast cancer patients suffering from hot flashes at least twice a day, who were not taking any medication against hypertension and depression received either clonidine 0.075 mg twice a day or venlafaxine 37.5 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary end point was defined as the frequency of hot flashes after 4 weeks of treatment. The secondary end points were the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the frequency of hot flashes during the first 4 weeks of treatment", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Profound changes in gene expression can result from abnormalities in the concentrations of sequence-specific transcription factors like specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Specificity protein 1 binding sites have been reported in the promoter regions of several genes implicated in autism. We hypothesize that dysfunction of Sp1 could affect the expression of multiple autism candidate genes, contributing to the heterogeneity of autism.\nContext 2: We observed elevated expression of Sp1 in ACG of autism patients (p =.010). We also observed altered expression of several autism candidate genes. GABRB3, RELN, and HTR2A showed reduced expression, whereas CD38, ITGB3, MAOA, MECP2, OXTR, and PTEN showed elevated expression in autism. In SK-N-SH cells, OXTR, PTEN, and RELN showed reduced expression upon Sp1/DNA binding inhibition and Sp1 silencing. The RNA integrity number was not available for any of the samples.\nContext 3: We assessed any alterations in the expression of Sp1 and that of autism candidate genes in the postmortem brain (anterior cingulate gyrus [ACG], motor cortex, and thalamus) of autism patients (n = 8) compared with healthy control subjects (n = 13). Alterations in the expression of candidate genes upon Sp1/DNA binding inhibition with mithramycin and Sp1 silencing by RNAi were studied in SK-N-SH neuronal cells.\nContext 4: Social communication difficulties represent an autistic trait that is highly heritable and persistent during the course of development. However, little is known about the underlying genetic architecture of this phenotype.\nContext 5: Two of our seven independent top signals (P-discovery <1.0E-05) were replicated (0.009 <P-replication \u22640.02) within RAINE and suggested evidence for association at 6p22.1 (rs9257616, meta-P = 2.5E-07) and 14q22.1 (rs2352908, meta-P = 1.1E-06). The signal at 6p22.1 was identified within the olfactory receptor gene cluster within the broader major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. The strongest candidate locus within this genomic area was TRIM27. This gene encodes an ubiquitin E3 ligase, which is an interaction partner of methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2). MBD2 is a transcriptional repressor that is involved in the regulation of the expression of several genes, including the MHC class II genes. The MHC class II genes are involved in the regulation of the immune response and are associated with autism. The MHC class II genes are also involved in the regulation of the immune response and are associated with autism. The MHC class II genes are involved in the regulation of the immune response and are associated with autism.

Many investigators have suggested that the vasoconstriction seen during hyperoxia/hyperoxaemia is mediated through the endothelium as a result of either increased release or activity of vasoconstrictors (oxygen radicals, endothelin, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, or serotonin (5-HT)), or reduced activity of vasodilators (prostaglandin E2 and", "Yes, elevated vancomycin trough is associated with nephrotoxicity in patients receiving high-dose vancomycin.\nExplanation: The primary objective of this study was to compare nephrotoxicity in ED sepsis patients who received vancomycin at high doses (>20 mg/kg) versus lower doses (\u226420 mg/kg). The authors found that patients who received high-dose vancomycin had a significantly lower rate of nephrotoxicity (5.8% vs. 11.1%). After age, sex, and initial SCr were adjusted for, the risk of high-dose vancomycin compared to low-dose was decreased for", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Multidrug-resistance is a serious obstacle encountered in leukemia treatment. Recent studies have shown microRNA-21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in several types of cancer and contributes to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. In our previous studies, we found triptolide (TPL) could enhance adriamycin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in K562/A02 cells.\nContext 2: TPL (5 nmol/L) increased the sensitivity of K562/A02 to adriamycin. When adriamycin was combined with 5 nmol/L TPL, the mean apoptotic population of K562/A02 cells was increased from 4.3 to 18.5%, respectively. K562/A02 cells showed a significant reduction in miR-21 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) expressions after TPL treatment. K562/A02 cells that were transfected with the miR-21 inhibitor had a significantly higher PTEN protein level than the control. K562 cells that were pre-treated with PTEN siRNA had increased survival rate compared to the control group.\nContext 3: In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of TPL on the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to adriamycin.\nContext 4: Cell viability was assessed by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Expression of mature miR-21 was determined by SYBER green PCR. The miR-21 mimics and inhibitors were chemically synthesized and transfected into K562 cells or K562/A02 cells. PTEN protein levels was determined by western blots. PTEN promoter activity was measured by luciferase assays.\nContext 5: We found that miR-20a-5p was more highly expressed in G-292 cells than in SJSA-1 cells. Forced expression of miR-20a-5p counteracted OS cell chemoresistance in both cell culture and tumor xenografts in nude mice. One of miR-20a-5p's targets, kinesin family member 26B (KIF26B), was found to mediate the miR-20a-5p-induced reduction in OS chemoresistance by modulating the activities of the MAPK/ERK and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a clear and concise answer to the question.", "Question: Do multiple gene expression classifiers from different array platforms predict poor prognosis of colorectal cancer??\nExplanation: The study by Kallioniemi et al. (2010) used two different array platforms to profile the gene expression of 302 patients with colorectal cancer. The study found that the gene classifiers based on clinical data, gene expression data, and a combination of the two were able to predict recurrence. The study also found that the New Zealand and German gene classifiers were cross-validated on the German and New Zealand data sets, respectively, to validate their predictive power. Survival analyses were done to evaluate the ability of the classifiers to predict patient survival. The study found that the New Zealand and German gene classifiers were able to predict poor prognosis", "#1: Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle insulin resistance and the insulin-sensitizing effect of thiazolidinediones in PCOS in vivo are less well characterized. In vitro data show that insulin may enhance basal and LH-stimulated ovarian androgen secretion, particularly in theca cells from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, in vivo studies gave inconsistent results.", "Question: Does prevalence and correlate of dietary supplement use in individuals with diabetes mellitus at an academic diabetes care clinic??\nContext 1: This study sought to describe the prevalence of supplement use by those with diabetes mellitus receiving care at an academic outpatient diabetes care center and to identify any association of supplement use with glycemic control.\nContext 2: This study is based on a retrospective audit of provider-verified and patient-self-reported medication and supplement use by adults with diabetes at the University of Washington Diabetes Care Center during four 2-week periods from fall 2006 through summer 2007 (1 period per season).\nContext 3: Verified medication and supplement histories for 459 adults demonstrated a per-person average use of 7 \u00b1 4", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) affects 0.2-2% of pregnant women. While the maternal clinical course of ICP is usually benign, the fetal effects can be severe spanning from spontaneous preterm birth to fetal demise to long term effects on the health of the progeny. ICP is characterized by high maternal serum levels of bile acids and placental and hepatic bile acids accumulation. Intrahepatic cholestasis, in the non-pregnant state, has been also linked to alterations of the mitochondrial activity attributed to high oxidative stress rates driven by high intracellular bile acids concentrations. Here we explored the hypothesis that elevated bile acid levels of ICP modify the placental mitochondrial activity.\nContext 2: A number of diseases are characterized by defective formation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. In the embryo, hepatoblasts differentiate to cholangiocytes, which give rise to the bile ducts. Here, we investigated duct development in mouse liver and characterized the role of the SRY-related HMG box transcription factor 9 (SOX9).\nContext 3: Intrahepatic cholestasis in rats was induced by \u03b1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) on days 1 and 8. The rats received YZH, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), or vehicle for 9 d and were killed on either day 3 or day 10. Serum biomarkers, liver histology, and the distribution of protein and mRNA expression of Mrp2 and Bsep were analyzed.\nContext 4: Several conditions are considered in differential diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis. Of these the most important is extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), while prompt diagnosis and surgical correction of obstruction can ameliorate clinical symptoms, provides long term survival for about one fourth of patients and serves as an important bridge to transplantation for many others. From histopathologic standpoint, features of EHBA overlaps with other diagnoses and so ancillary tests such as immunohistochemical staining for CD56 is suggested by some authors as a helpful tool in differential diagnosis.Hereby we wanted to examine this staining in our center which is a referral children hospital and to prove its efficacy in our problematic cases.\nContext 5: To assess if being small for gestational age impacts parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) development.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?\n    - What is the role of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The use of the volar plate to treat distal radius fractures is increasing but despite the theoretical advantages of a volar approach there have been reports of extensor tendon ruptures due to prominent screw tips protruding past the dorsal cortex. The valley in the intermediate column between Lister tubercle and the sigmoid notch of the distal radius makes it difficult to rely on fluoroscopy to judge screw length. Our aim was to quantify the dimensions of this valley and to demonstrate the danger of relying on intraoperative image intensification fluoroscopy to determine lengths of distal screws.\nContext 2: Volar locking plate fixation is a common treatment method for distal radius fractures. Recently, implants have been designed with an option to use locking screws in the shaft portion of the plate. While there is a high incidence of low bone mineral density in patients who sustain fragility fractures of the distal radius, the need for locking shaft screws is not well defined. Our hypothesis is that the routine use of locking screws in the shaft portion of volar plates is not required to maintain reduction or to prevent hardware failure.\nContext 3: A retrospective review was performed in all patients over age 50\u00a0years who underwent volar plate fixation using an implant with non-locking shaft screws for a distal radius fracture during a 2-year period. Patients were permitted to perform early range of motion exercises. Radiographs were examined and measurements were obtained to assess maintenance of reduction and incidence of hardware failure. Patients were followed at least until fracture healing. Patients were excluded from analysis if locking shaft screws were utilized or if follow-up was inadequate.\nContext 4: The management of fractures of the distal radius continues to evolve. New operative strategies have recently been developed including the use of fixed-angle plates. This study reviews the results of 20 patients with fractures of the distal radius treated with a new multidirectional fixed angle plate.\nContext 5: We measured the depth of this valley in the intermediate column of the distal radius in 33 patients with computed tomographic (9 patients) or magnetic resonance image (24 patients) scans of the wrist. There was a consistent valley in all images examined [average 1.8 mm (95% confidence interval, 1.6-2.0 mm)]. Thirty-nine percent of wrists had a valley depth of at least 2 mm.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article and/or the literature.\nThe article and/or literature does not provide evidence to support your answer.\nThe article and/or literature provides evidence to support your answer, but the evidence is not strong enough to support your answer.\nThe article and/or literature provides strong evidence to support your answer.\n\n## Context 1: The use of the volar plate to treat distal radius fractures is increasing but despite the theoretical advantages of a volar approach there have been reports of extensor tendon ruptures due to prominent screw tips protruding past the dorsal cortex.

This is likely due to the increased risk of vasospasm and cerebral edema in patients with hypernatremia.", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The study found that increased REE was associated with failure to thrive in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency. This is because the infants with severe combined immunodeficiency have a high resting energy expenditure relative to their body weight. This means that they have a high energy requirement. The study found that the infants with severe combined immunodeficiency had a higher REE than the infants with other diseases. This means that the infants with severe combined immunodeficiency had a higher energy requirement than the infants with other diseases.

Ang-2 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and is expressed in the endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature. Ang-2 is also expressed in the endothelium of the coronary vasculature and is thought to play a role in the regulation of coronary blood flow. Ang-2 is also expressed in the endothelium of the pulmonary vasculature and is thought to play a role in the regulation of pulmonary blood flow", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study tested the hypothesis that Malawian children at risk for zinc deficiency will have reduced endogenous fecal zinc (EFZ) and increased net absorbed zinc (NAZ) following the addition of high amylose maize resistant starch (RS) to their diet.\nContext 2: This was a small controlled clinical trial to determine the effects of added dietary RS on zinc homeostasis among 17 stunted children, aged 3-5 years consuming a plant-based diet and at risk for perturbed zinc homeostasis. Dual zinc stable isotope studies were performed before and after 28 d of intervention with RS, so that each child served as their own control. The RS was incorporated into fried wheat flour dough and given under direct observation twice daily for 28 d. Changes in zinc homeostatic measures were compared using paired Student's t-tests and linear regression analysis.\nContext 3: Children had a mean height-for-age Z-score of -3.3, and consumed animal source foods \u2264twice per month. Their habitual diet contained a phytate:zinc molar ratio of 34:1. Children avidly consumed the RS without complaints. EFZ was 0.8\u00b10.4mg/d (mean\u00b1SD) both before and after the intervention. Fractional absorption of zinc was 0.38\u00b10.08 and 0.35\u00b10.06 before and after the RS intervention respectively. NAZ was 1.1\u00b10.5 and 0.6\u00b10.7 before and after the RS intervention. This reduction of NAZ corresponded with diminished dietary zinc intake on the study day following intervention with RS. Regression analysis indicated no change in zinc absorption relative to dietary intake as a result of the RS intervention.\nContext 4: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of zinc supplementation on growth, morbidity, and motor development in healthy, term, breastfed infants.\nContext 5: Plasma copper and zinc were estimated at baseline and after 120 d of supplementation in a randomly selected infant subset (115) of the children. Of these, 61 children were in a zinc group (Z) getting 10 mg of elemental zinc, and 54 were in a control group (C) getting supplement without zinc.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does resistant starch affect zinc homeostasis in children at risk for zinc deficiency?\nYes, no, maybe\nExplanation: The study found that children at risk for zinc deficiency had reduced endogenous fecal zinc (EFZ) and increased net absorbed zinc (NAZ) following the addition of high amylose maize resistant starch (RS) to their diet. This suggests that the RS may have increased the absorption of zinc in the gut, which could have contributed to the children's improved growth and development. However, the study did not measure the absorption of zinc in the gut, so it is not clear whether the RS actually increased the absorption of zinc in the gut. Further studies are needed to determine whether the RS affects zinc absorption in the gut and whether this affects growth and development in", "Question: Do biological inflammatory markers mediate the effect of preoperative pain-related behaviours on postoperative analgesics requirements??\nExplanation: The study was designed to investigate the effect of preoperative pain-related behaviours on postoperative analgesic requirements. The study was conducted in 100 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) a control group (n = 33), (2) a preoperative pain group (n = 33), and (3) a preoperative pain and preoperative analgesia group (n = 34). The preoperative pain group received a preoperative pain questionnaire and a preoperative analgesia questionnaire. The preoperative analgesia group received a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Vaginal douching is a common practice worldwide. Its effect on the natural history of the early lesion of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), is unknown.\nContext 2: In a prospective nation-wide cohort (n=1332), epidemiological variables including habit of vaginal douching after intercourse and outcomes of LSIL were studied. Colposcopy-confirmed LSIL women (n=295) were followed every 3 months. Parameters of HPV infection, sexual behavior, personal hygiene and environmental exposures were compared with the follow-up outcomes.\nContext 3: There was a 15% chance of HSIL co-existing with the LSIL cytology result. Eight percent of colposcopy-confirmed LSIL were found with HSIL in 1 year. With a follow-up of up to 36 months, 83% LSIL regressed, 11% progressed and 6% persisted. The mean time (95% CIs) to regression and progression were 5.2 (4.7-5.8) and 8.0 (5.8-10.3) months, respectively. Risk factors of the non-regression of LSIL included HPV prevalence on enrollment, habit of vaginal douching after intercourse with a hygiene product and non-regular Pap screening, with odd ratio of 4.4 (1.9-10.3), 3.14 (1.04-9.49) and 2.12 (1.24-3.62), respectively. HPV prevalence and vaginal douching also conferred a slower regression of LSIL (8.0 vs. 4.1 months, P<.001 and 8.0 vs. 5.6 months, P=0.02, respectively).\nContext 4: Random biopsy (RB) of normal appearing cervix during colposcopy increases high-grade dysplasia (HSIL) diagnosis but has not been studied in high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), that is, colposcopy transferred to the anal canal. We investigated the utility of RB during HRA.\nContext 5: The cumulative incidence of infection with any HPV type at 12 months was 15% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.20]. About 72% of men with incident HPV cleared the infection by 12 months. The presence of cervical HPV in men was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of infection with any HPV type (95% CI, 1.2-5.2) and a 3.5-fold increased risk of infection with HPV 16 (95% CI, 1.2-10.0). The presence of HPV 16 in men was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of infection with any HPV type (95% CI, 1.2-5.2) and a 3.5-fold increased risk of infection with HPV 16 (95% CI, 1.2-10.0). The presence of HPV 16 in men was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of infection", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway can stimulate tumor cell migration and metastasis. Furthermore, hypoxic tumors are associated with a poor prognosis. Besides the HIF-1 pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is also induced by hypoxic conditions. The PKR-like ER kinase (PERK)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-arm of the UPR induces expression of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3), a factor that has been linked to metastasis and poor prognosis in solid tumors. In this study the role of UPR-induced LAMP3 in hypoxia-mediated migration of breast cancer cells was examined.\nContext 2: Using transwell assays, migration of different breast cancer cell lines was assessed. A direct correlation was found between cell migration and baseline LAMP3 expression. Furthermore, moderate hypoxia (1% O2) was found to be optimal in stimulating migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of PERK, ATF4 and LAMP3 reduced migration of cells under these conditions. Using gap closure assays, similar results were found. In a three-dimensional invasion assay into collagen, LAMP3 knockdown cells showed a diminished capacity to invade compared to control cells when collectively grown in multicellular spheroids.\nContext 3: A number of in vitro metastasis models were used to study the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. PERK, ATF4 and their downstream factor LAMP3 were knocked down to examine their role in cell migration. In addition, multicellular tumor spheroids were used to study the involvement of the tumor microenvironment in invasion.\nContext 4: Tumors encounter endoplasmic reticulum stress during tumor growth and activate an adaptive pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Because this pathway is induced by the tumor microenvironment, it is a promising target for cancer therapy. We have previously demonstrated that X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), a key regulator of the UPR, was required for survival under hypoxia and critical for tumor growth in tumor xenografts. In this study, we investigated the role of XBP-1 in regulating tumor angiogenesis.\nContext 5: Hypoxia is a common characteristic of solid tumors associated with reduced response to radio- and chemotherapy, therefore increasing the probability of tumor recurrence. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway is a key regulator of angiogenesis and is activated by hypoxia. In this study, we investigated the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in regulating tumor angiogenesis.\nContext 6: The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway is a key regulator of angiogenesis and is activated by hypoxia. In this study, we investigated the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in regulating tumor angiogenesis.\nContext 7: The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 pathway is a key regulator of angiogenesis and is activated by hypoxia. In this study, we investigated the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in regulating", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Increased free radicals and/or impaired antioxidant defenses have been shown to play a pathogenetic role in human and animal models of inflammatory bowel disease. Our previous studies showed that prohibitin (PHB) levels are decreased during colitis and that cultured intestinal epithelial cells overexpressing PHB are protected from oxidative stress. This study investigated the effect of intestinal epithelial cell-specific PHB overexpression on oxidative stress associated with experimental colitis and the potential mechanism by which PHB functions as an antioxidant using PHB transgenic mice.\nContext 2: Oxidative stress is presumed to play an important role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Accordingly, antioxidant supplementation might be protective. Dietary calcium inhibited colitis development in HLA-B27 transgenic rats, an animal model mimicking IBD. As antioxidants might act at mucosa level and calcium predominantly in the gut lumen, we hypothesize that the combination has additive protective effects on colitis development.\nContext 3: Rats with colitis developed macroscopic and microscopic colonic lesions accompanied by a significant decrease in the CBF, a significant rise in colonic weight, MPO activity and plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. These effects were aggravated by ASA and 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole (SC-560), but not celecoxib and counteracted by concurrent treatment with a synthetic prostaglandin E\u2082 (PGE\u2082) analog. Treatment with NO-ASA dose-dependently accelerated colonic healing followed by a rise in plasma NO(x) content and CBF, suppression of MPO and downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNAs. Treatment with GTN, the NO donor, significantly inhibited the ASA-induced colonic lesions and increased CBF, while carboxy-PTIO or capsaicin-denervation counteracted the NO-ASA-induced improvement of colonic healing and the accompanying increase in the CBF. These effects were restored by co-treatment with calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and NO-ASA in capsaicin-denervated animals.\nContext 4: Colitis was induced using 2 established mouse models (Salmonella typhimurium and dextran sodium sulfate) in PHB transgenic mice and wild-type littermates. Colitis was characterized by macroscopic and microscopic colonic lesions, increased MPO activity and plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. These effects were aggravated by ASA and counteracted by concurrent treatment with a synthetic prostaglandin E\u2082 (PGE\u2082) analog. Treatment with NO-ASA dose-dependently accelerated colonic healing followed by a rise in plasma NO(x) content and CBF, suppression of MPO and downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNAs.

These new lunch menu patterns increase fruit to one serving and vegetables to two servings, with 50 % wholegrain food.\nContext 2: Lunch food records were collected from middle-school students from four schools in south-east Texas in the spring of 2008, and entered into the Nutrition Data System for Research software. Average intake was calculated for those consuming meals according to the National School Lunch Program (NSLP; n 5414) and for those", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Human osteoclast formation from mononuclear phagocyte precursors involves interactions between tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily members and their receptors. LIGHT is a transmembrane protein expressed and shed from the surface of activated T cells. Since activated T cells have been implicated in osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this study sought to determine whether LIGHT can regulate RANKL/cytokine-induced osteoclast formation, to identify the mechanism by which LIGHT influences osteoclastogenesis, and to investigate the presence of LIGHT in the serum of RA patients.\nContext 2: In the presence and absence of RANKL, LIGHT induced osteoclast formation from both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophage precursors, in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no inhibition was observed by adding osteoprotegerin, RANK:Fc, TNFalpha, or interleukin-8 or by blocking the LIGHT receptors herpesvirus entry mediator or lymphotoxin beta receptor. However, formation of osteoclasts was significantly decreased by the soluble decoy receptor for LIGHT, DcR3, and by blocking antibodies to the p75 component of the TNF receptor. A significant increase in LIGHT levels in the serum of RA patients compared with normal controls was also noted.\nContext 3: The effect of LIGHT on human and murine osteoclast formation was assessed in the presence and absence of neutralizing reagents to known osteoclastogenic factors. Serum levels of LIGHT in RA patients were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nContext 4: We studied the role of LIGHT in intestinal inflammation using Tnfsf14(-/-) and wild-type mice. Colitis was induced by transfer of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells into Rag1(-/-) or Tnfsf14(-/-)Rag1(-/-) mice, or by administration of dextran sulfate sodium to Tnfsf14(-/-) or wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Mice were weighed, colon tissues were collected and measured, and histology analyses were performed. We measured infiltrating cell populations and expression of cytokines, chemokines, and LIGHT.\nContext 5: It has been suggested that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with abundant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are more likely to respond to TNF-alpha inhibitors. We sought to determine whether LIGHT is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and whether LIGHT levels are increased in RA patients.\nContext 6: We sought to determine whether LIGHT is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and whether LIGHT levels are increased in RA patients.\nContext 7: We sought to determine whether LIGHT is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and whether LIGHT levels are increased in RA patients.\nContext 8: We sought to determine whether LIGHT is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and whether LIGHT levels are increased in RA patients.\nContext 9: We sought to determine whether LIGHT is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and whether LIGHT levels are increased in RA patients.\nContext 10: We sought to determine whether LIGHT is a TNF-alpha inhibitor and whether LIGHT levels are increased in RA patients", "Question: Is sense of coherence associated with reduced psychological responses to job stressors among Japanese factory workers??\nExplanation: The present study was conducted to examine the association between sense of coherence (SOC), as advocated by Antonovsky, and psychological responses to job stressors among Japanese workers.\nContext 1: Job stress is associated with adverse health effects. The present study was conducted to examine the association between sense of coherence (SOC), as advocated by Antonovsky, and psychological responses to job stressors among Japanese workers.\nContext 2: The perceived impact of stress on health was negatively associated with sense of coherence (P<0.01), but there was no significant association with demographic or clinical characteristics. The perceived impact of stress on health and self-rated", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Hooded Wistar rats were given either the Wnt inhibitor, dickkopf (30 and 100 ng), daily or vehicle control intraperitoneally from days 11 to 15 and were killed at day 16. Intestinal morphometry was used to measure villous area, crypt area, percentage of crypt fission, and crypt mitotic count. Intestinal stem cells were assessed by expression of real time-polymerase chain reaction for Lgr5 (a stem cell marker), and the number of \u03b2-catenin-expressing crypts by immunostaining was determined after 100-ng dickkopf treatment.\nContext 2: Intestinal crypt fission peaks during infancy. In human and experimental familial polyposis coli, increased crypt fission is due to activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling, but the molecular basis of crypt fission during intestinal growth has not been examined. The aim of this project was to investigate whether crypt fission and intestinal growth are affected by experimental blockade of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.\nContext 3: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent mitogen for the gastrointestinal tract and also influences the number of new crypts formed by crypt fission. The time course of these events and possible linkage between these two complementary mechanisms is however poorly understood. We therefore examined the temporal relationship of proliferation and fission in rats treated with EGF.\nContext 4: In the small intestine, EGF significantly increased epithelial cell proliferation and crypt and villus area after 24 hours of EGF, although maximal effects were only reached following six days of infusion. EGF also resulted in an approximate 30% reduction in crypt fission in the small bowel. In the colon, EGF caused a twofold increase in epithelial cell proliferation one day after infusion, from 15.3 (2.3) to 29.6 (3.5) metaphases per crypt (p<0.01). Maximal effects were seen in rats receiving EGF for seven days. For all time points, colonic crypt size increased in response to EGF. The amount of branching increased following one day of infusion with EGF (from 15.3 (1.9) to 32.4 (5.5)%; p<0.001) but was significantly lower (approximately 25% of control values) following longer periods of infusion. Crypt fission did not correlate with either crypt size or branching. EGF also increased the number of \u03b2-catenin-expressing crypts in the colon, but this effect was not seen in the small intestine.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EGF on crypt fission and proliferation in the small intestine and colon of rats. EGF increased crypt fission in the small intestine, but not in the colon. EGF also increased crypt proliferation in the small intestine, but not in the colon. The increase in crypt proliferation was not due to an increase in the number of crypts, but rather to an increase in the number of cells within the crypts. The increase in crypt proliferation was not due to an increase in the number", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway is involved in cell growth and proliferation and is associated with tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. This study aims to elucidate whether variation in the IGF-1 pathway is predictive for pathologic response in early HER2 negative breast cancer (BC) patients, taking part in the phase III NEOZOTAC trial, randomizing between 6\u00a0cycles of neoadjuvant TAC chemotherapy with or without zoledronic acid.\nContext 2: During chemotherapy, a significant number of tumors (47.2\u00a0%) showed a decrease in IGF-1R expression, while in a small number of tumors an upregulation was seen (15.1\u00a0%). IGF-1R expression before treatment was not associated with pathological response, however, absence of IGF-1R expression after treatment was associated with a better response in multivariate analysis (P\u2009=\u20090.006) and patients with a decrease in expression during treatment showed a better response to chemotherapy as well (P\u2009=\u20090.020). Moreover, the variant T allele of 3129G\u2009>\u2009T in IGF1R (rs2016347) was associated with a better pathological response in multivariate analysis (P\u2009=\u20090.032).\nContext 3: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of pre-chemotherapy biopsies and operation specimens were collected for analysis of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression (n\u2009=\u2009216) and for analysis of 8 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of the IGF-1 pathway (n\u2009=\u2009184) using OpenArray\u00ae RealTime PCR. Associations with patient and tumor characteristics and chemotherapy response according to Miller and Payne pathologic response were performed using chi-square and regression analysis.\nContext 4: Patients with primary breast cancer (n=173) who had hormone receptor-positive tumors and who also received adjuvant tamoxifen were included in the current study. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 10 and CYP2C19 2, 3 were analyzed.\nContext 5: Despite advances in treatment, recurrent breast cancer remains a lethal disease. The epidermal growth factor receptor family has been suggested to play a role in breast cancer. However, no investigations of the frequency of EGFR mutation and the potential role of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in breast cancer have been performed in the Netherlands.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of EGFR mutations in a large cohort of Dutch breast cancer patients and to evaluate the potential role of EGFR TKIs in the treatment of breast cancer.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of EGFR mutations in a large cohort of Dutch breast cancer patients and to evaluate the potential role of EGFR TKIs in the treatment of breast cancer.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of EGFR mutations in a large cohort of Dutch breast cancer patients and to evaluate the potential role of EGFR TKIs in the treatment of breast cancer", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To investigate the protective effects of Huperzine A, a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, against the hypoxic ischemic brain damage (HIBD) of the cognitive and morphology in the neonatal rats.\nContext 2: Both scopolamine (100 ng) and muscimol (50 ng), injected intracranially 5 min before training, resulted in a decreased avoidance rate. Huperzine A (25 ng), injected intracranially 15 min before training, reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and muscimol at 30 min after training, and this reversal persisted at least 1 h. The improving effects of huperzine A exhibited a bell-shaped dose-response curve.\nContext 3: Postnatal 7 days old rats were given vehicle or Huperzine A (0.05 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) following HIBD (unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia) or sham operation, and then tested the learning ability and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) from 36 to 40 postnatal days. The performance in MWM (escape latency, probe time) were recorded to evaluate the learning and memory dysfunction. At the end of MWM trials, the rats were decapitated and their brains were histologically analyzed. The tissue loss in different brain regions including striatum, cortex, and hippocampus were analyzed by image analysis system. The CA(1) subfield neurons numbers were counted to evaluate the brain damage. The acetylcholinesterase histochemistry staining was used to determine the activity of acetylcholinesterase in different brain regions.\nContext 4: Compared with sham-operated group, HIBD rats with the vehicle treatment displayed significant tissue losses in the hippocampus (including CA(1) neurons), cortex, and striatum, as well as severe spatial memory deficits (escape latency: 44 s vs 30 s, P < 0.05, probe time: 14 s vs 40 s, P < 0.01). Huperzine A treatment (0.1 mg/kg) resulted in significant protection against both HI-induced brain tissue losses and spatial memory impairments (mean escape latency: 34 s vs 44 s, P < 0.05, probe time: 35 s vs 14 s,P < 0.01). However, the protective effects of Huperzine A were not observed in the hippocampus (including CA(1) neurons) and cortex.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that Huperzine A may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of HIBD.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Huperzine A on the learning and memory of rats with hypoxic ischemic brain damage (HIBD). The results showed that Huperzine A (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly improved the learning and memory of HIBD rats. The improvement of learning and memory was associated with the increase of CA(1) neurons in the hippocampus. The results", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most commonly diagnosed malignant soft tissue tumour in children and adolescents. Aberrant expression of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and MET gene has been implicated in the malignant progression of RMS, especially in the alveolar subtype. This observation suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a kinase inhibitor against ALK and MET, may have a therapeutic role in RMS, although its antitumour activity in this malignancy has not yet been studied.\nContext 2: RH4 and RH30 alveolar RMS (ARMS) cell lines were treated with crizotinib and then assessed by using proliferation, viability, migration and colony formation assays. Multiple approaches, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, western blotting and siRNA-based knock-down, were used in order to investigate possible molecular mechanisms linked to crizotinib activity.\nContext 3: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements invariably develop resistance to the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. Herein, we report the first preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI, ceritinib (LDK378), in the setting of crizotinib resistance. An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease.\nContext 4: In this study, we investigated the effect of crizotinib on the proliferation and migration of human lung cancer cells. We found that crizotinib inhibited the proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells, and the migration of A549 and H1299 cells. The inhibition of the proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells by crizotinib was associated with the down-regulation of the expression of the ALK and MET genes. The inhibition of the proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells by crizotinib was associated with the down-regulation of the expression of the ALK and MET genes.

The aim was to examine the effects of type 2 diabetes on cognitive function, and to investigate whether consumption of low glycaemic load breakfasts affects cognitive function in adults with type 2 diabetes.\nContext 2: Memory, psychomotor skill and executive function were examined at two morning", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The perineum stretches naturally during obstetrical labor, but it is unknown whether this stretch has a negative impact on pelvic floor outcomes after a vaginal birth (VB). We aimed to evaluate whether perineal stretch was associated with postpartum pelvic floor dysfunction, and we hypothesized that greater perineal stretch would correlate with worsened outcomes.\nContext 2: This was a prospective cohort study of primiparous women who had a VB. Perineal body (PB) length was measured antepartum, during labor, and 6\u00a0months postpartum. We determined the maximum PB (PBmax) measurements during the second stage of labor and PB change (\u0394PB) between time points. Women completed functional questionnaires and had a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system exam 6\u00a0months postpartum. We analyzed the relationship of PB measurements to perineal lacerations and postpartum outcomes, including urinary, anal, and fecal incontinence, sexual activity and function, and POP-Q measurements.\nContext 3: Four hundred and forty-eight women with VB and a mean age of 24\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0\u00a0years with rare (5\u00a0%) third- or fourth-degree lacerations were assessed. During the second stage of labor, 270/448 (60\u00a0%) had perineal measurements. Mean antepartum PB length was 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0cm, with a maximum mean PB length (PBmax) during the second stage of 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00a0cm, an increase of 65\u00a0%. The change in PB length (\u0394PB) from antepartum to 6\u00a0months postpartum was a net decrease (-0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20091.02\u00a0cm).

It is accepted that with changes in salt intake, renal sodium elimination will prevent any change in interstitial Na content and concentration. This review summarizes recent anomalous findings regarding salt and water homeostasis that are inconsistent with current assumptions.\nContext 2: Sodium intake increases urinary calcium excretion and may thus lead to negative calcium balance and bone loss.\nContext 3: High sodium consumption has been repeatedly reported", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Exposure of human and bovine endothelial cells to IL-1beta decreased eNOS expression. Western blot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies showed that IL-1beta stimulated p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylated ATF2. BPS inhibited these effects via protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) activation. Transfection assays using site-specific mutation constructs showed that CRE/ATF elements located at -733 and -603 within the human eNOS promoter are necessary for full IL-1beta responsiveness. BPS attenuated the IL-1beta-mediated decrease in eNOS promoter activity and the expression of eNOS gene through PKA pathway. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays showed that IL-1beta increased the binding of phosphorylated ATF2 to CRE/ATF. On treatment with BPS, phosphorylated CREB predominantly bound to CRE/ATF.\nContext 2: Migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to formation of vascular stenotic lesions such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a potent migration factor for VSMCs. cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is the stimulus-induced transcription factor and activates transcription of target genes such as c-fos and interleukin-6. We examined whether CREB is involved in TNF-alpha-induced VSMC migration.\nContext 3: Here we show in C57BL/6J mice that 4-week treatment with the long-lasting EPO analogue darbepoetin-alpha (DPO) at a dose of 10 microg/kg/week induces a reduction of platelet reactivity using flow cytometry and Western blot analysis of tyrosine-specific platelet phosphorylation. Additionally, immunohistochemistry of endothelial adhesion molecule expression and ELISA of circulating endothelial activation markers demonstrated a reduced endothelial activation. Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis revealed a significant (P<0.05) increase of eNOS expression. Further, DPO did not exert prothrombogenic effects in a murine intravital microscopic thrombosis model of the cremaster muscle. The role of eNOS in prevention of DPO-mediated microvascular thrombosis is further underlined by a significantly accelerated thrombus formation on DPO treatment in eNOS (-/-) mice.\nContext 4: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the long-lasting EPO analogue darbepoetin-alpha (DPO) on platelet activation and thrombosis in mice.

Tissues were studied by H&E staining, immunolabeling, immunoblot, and zymography.\nContext 3: To compare gas exchange with heliox and oxygen-enriched air during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, while controlling for tidal volume, in a pediatric swine model of acute lung injury. We hypothesized that when tidal volume delivery is held constant, heliox does not alter gas exchange.\nContext 4: Two-week-old rats were allocated for ventilation with VT 7 mL/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5 cm H\u2082O (low V(T)) or V(T) 21 mL/kg and PEEP 1 (high V(T)) for 4 hours. Additional rats were subjected to volume-controlled hemorrhage and delayed saline resuscitation, followed by low V(T) or high V(T) ventilation for 4 hours. Nonventilated control groups were also included. Airway resistance and the coefficient of tissue elastance were derived from respiratory input impedance measurements using the low-frequency forced oscillation technique. Pressure-volume curves were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. Interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum.\nContext 5: Acute lung injury (A-a gradient of >300 mm Hg) was created using repeated saline lavage during conventional mechanical ventilation. The animals were then administered high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and ventilated with 60% oxygen/40% helium and 60% oxygen/40% nitrogen in a randomized, crossover trial. When changing gas mixtures within each animal, mean airway pressure (Paw = 16.8 +/- 0.3 cm H(2)O) and frequency (10 Hz) were held constant.

Histologic analysis revealed a uniform appearance of the vocal fold without apparent layers. The cell density of the lamina propria was 30 or more cells per 100 microm2 for 51.2% of larynges with less than 27 weeks of gestation. However, only 14.3% of the larynges with 27 or more weeks of gestation had an average cell density of 30 or more cells per region (p < 0.005).\nContext 3: Intact neonatal larynges were obtained from fresh cadaveric specimens. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were used to visualize the laryngeal structures, and photomicrographs of the vocal folds were taken at 100x magnification. The cell density of the lamina propria was calculated by counting the cells within each of five 100-microm2 regions within the study area, and the totals were then averaged for each area.\nContext 4: Confusion exists about the effect of mass and size of the vocal folds on fundamental frequency (F0) of phonation. In particular, greater vocal fold thickness is often assumed to be associated with lower F0. The purpose here is to show that such a relationship does not exist and that F0 should be conceptualized with quantities other than mass (i.e., length and tissue stress).\nContext 5: Collagen secretion by human vocal fold fibroblasts (HVFF) was assayed in response to TGF-\u03b21, PGE2, and specific EP receptor agonists. Basal HVFF migratory rate was also quantified in response to PGE2. TGF-\u03b21 induced COX-2 mRNA expression/PGE2 secretion was assayed.

The proportion of infants receiving antibiotics for suspected EOS was 2.1% and 1.7% before and after the change of protocol (p = 0.09). Reduction of diagnostic tests was associated with earlier antibiotic treatment in infants treated for suspected EOS (hazard ratio 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.07; p <0.001), and in infants with neonatal infection (hazard ratio 2.20; 95% CI 1.19-4.06; p = 0.01). There was no difference in the duration of hospital stay nor in the proportion of infants requiring respiratory or cardiovascular support before and after the change of protocol.\nContext 3: We collected information from the hospital records of 91 neonates with suspected sepsis and of 152 febrile children with suspected infection on the number of ordered CRP tests, the number of EB-CRP tests, and the impact of the test results on decision-making. CRP diagnostic accuracy studies focusing on pediatric infections were reviewed critically. The main outcomes were the proportion of CRP tests that were EB and the proportion of tests that affected decision-making. A secondary outcome was the overall one-year expenditure on CRP testing.\nContext 4: Our objectives were to identify factors associated with the duration of the first antibiotic course initiated in the first 3 postnatal days and to assess associations between the duration of the initial antibiotic course and subsequent necrotizing enterocolitis or death in extremely low birth weight infants with sterile initial postnatal culture results.\nContext 5: We investigated the impact of implementing a protocol aiming at reducing the number of diagnostic tests in infants with risk factors for EOS in order to compare the diagnostic performance of repeated clinical examination with CBC and CRP measurement. The primary outcome was the time between birth and the first dose of antibiotics in infants treated for suspected EOS.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nThe article is about the impact of reducing diagnostic tests on the time to antibiotic treatment in infants with risk factors for EOS.

We used proportional hazards models to analyze the first onset of cardiovascular events in relation with RD, MD, or percentage of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in those with low-to-moderate RAS (10-70%) (n = 181).\nContext 2: After the third year of follow-up, nonfatal myocardial infarction and revascularization rates were significantly increased in patients with renal insufficiency compared with those without renal dysfunction (16.9% vs 7.7%, P = 0.001; 29.4% vs 15.8%, P < 0.001). In patients who had recurrent cardiovascular events, a significantly higher rate of de novo stenosis revascularization was found in patients with renal insufficiency than without renal insufficiency (57.7% vs 22.7%, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in target lesion revascularization between the groups (51.9% vs 43.6%, P = 0.323). Multivariate analysis demonstrated an independent impact of the presence of renal insufficiency on the major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio: 1.488, 95% confidence interval: 1.051 - 2.106, P = 0.025) and de novo stenosis (hazard ratio: 5.505, 95% confidence interval: 2.151 - 14.090, P < 0.001).\nContext 3: Of 185 hypertensive patients, 45 (24%) showed accessory renal arteries. Of these 45 patients, nine (20%) showed renal artery stenosis and 36 (80%) showed no significant stenosis. Of the 140 patients with a single renal artery, 42 (30%) showed renal artery stenosis and 98 (70%) showed no stenosis. The odds ratio of renal artery stenosis in the accessory renal artery group versus the single renal artery group was 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.3%), which is not statistically significant at a power of 0.85 (chi(2) = 1.705; p = 1.0).\nContext 4: To determine the relationship between severity of stenosis and hemodynamic significance in calcified coronary arteries.\nContext 5: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 1,000 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary angiography.

However, changes in the elastic properties of the central aorta and their relevance to left ventricular geometry have not been studied in patients after KD with and without coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs).\nContext 2: HLA-B associated transcript (BAT) 2, 3, and 5 polymorphisms and haplotypes are associated with Kawasaki disease (KD) and coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) formations.\nContext 3: Hyperhomocysteinemia is known as a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Preclinical arteriosclerosis is noted and premature atherosclerosis is known to be accelerated in Kawasaki disease (KD) patients. Genetic polymorphisms in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene result in elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations and are known to be associated with the development of coronary artery disease. Our hypothesis is that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTHFR gene are related to the development of KD and coronary artery lesions (CALs).\nContext 4: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis childhood disease frequently complicating coronary artery lesions (CALs). Recently, the gene encoding a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) was found to modify vascular pathology in humans by differentially regulating the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway, which affects KD/CAL susceptibility. To explore the potential role of ADAM17 in KD occurrence and outcomes, we investigated the association of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAM17 and three pathway genes of TGF-\u03b2 signaling with KD phenotypes in a Han Chinese population, including 392 KD patients and 421 non-KD controls. Three ADAM17 SNPs showed an association with KD risk, which was further confirmed by haplotype analysis. The effect of ADAM17 on KD was also shown by multi-variable logistic regression analysis. In two-locus model analyses with SNPs in ADAM17 and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway genes, stronger compound effects on the risk of KD and secondary CAL formation were observed relative to comparable single SNPs.\nContext 5: Clinical and laboratory characteristics of 75 patients with KD were compared with those of 57 controls. The patients with KD included 30 males and 45 females, with a mean age of 6.5 years. The patients with KD had a higher incidence of CALs (p = 0.001) and a higher incidence of CALs with aortic aneurysms (p = 0.001). The patients with KD had a higher incidence of CALs with aortic aneurysms (p = 0.001) and a higher incidence of CALs with aortic aneurysms (p = 0.001).

No tumor cells were detected in products infused in 17/26 (A) and 5/33 (B) patients. The five year overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS) and relapse rate (RR) were 51%, 20% and 80% in arm A and 45%, 18% and 80% in arm B respectively with no significant difference between the two groups. Thirteen patients in arm A and 2 in arm B experienced episodes of serious early infection (p=0.02). There were 3 early transplant related deaths in A but none in B.\nContext 3: A total of 358 patients who received transplants from January 2003 to December 2004 (201 male and 157 female patients, ages from 2.7 to 77.3 years with median of 53 years of age) underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell collection after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or G-CSF plus chemotherapy priming. This retrospective study included patients with diagnoses of acute myelogenous leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and solid tumors. All patients underwent stem cell collection until a target or a minimum CD34+ cell dose was reached. Correlations were performed between stem cell mobilization and/or collection efficacy and transplantation outcomes.\nContext 4: We retrospectively investigated the efficacy and predictive factors for the treatment outcomes of bortezomib plus dexamethasone (BD) as second-line induction therapy prior to high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.\nContext 5: Levels of CD44 were almost 2-fold higher in the patients' grafts. Highest levels were found in the grafts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and plasma cell myeloma, congruent with known CD44 expression levels in these malignancies. The survival advantage of the CD44+ grafts was not statistically significant, but the CD44+ grafts were associated with a higher risk of relapse.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CD34+ selection in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous transplantation.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CD34+ selection in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous transplantation.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CD34+ selection in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous transplantation.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was", "Question: Is prolonged enteral feeding often required to avoid long-term nutritional and metabolic complications after esophagogastric dissociation??\nExplanation: The answer is no. Prolonged enteral feeding is not required to avoid long-term nutritional and metabolic complications after esophagogastric dissociation. The reason is that the esophagogastric dissociation is a surgical procedure to treat severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children with neurological impairment.

Self-assessed competency may not accurately identify training needs.\nTo evaluate self-assessed level of clinical skills of graduating medical students at Zagreb University School of Medicine and compare them with clinical skill levels expected by their teachers and those defined by a criterion standard.\nWe investigated whether family medicine residents demonstrated increased skill in formulating clinical questions over their 3 years", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Latent mesangial immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposition in the donated kidney has been investigated in the context of kidney transplantation. However, few studies have examined the impact of mesangial expansion accompanied with IgA deposition. Therefore, we investigated the effects of latent IgA deposition and mesangial expansion on transplant prognosis following living-donor kidney transplantation.\nContext 2: Twenty kidneys exhibited latent IgA deposition in pre-implantation biopsies, including 14 with mesangial expansion. Latent IgA deposition was not associated with renal function or donor urinalysis after donation, irrespective of mesangial expansion. Latent IgA deposition was not significantly associated with graft survival rate, allograft function, abnormal urinalysis, or the recurrence of IgA nephropathy, irrespective of mesangial expansion. At one year after transplantation, IgA deposition had disappeared in 14/20 allografts. Estimated glomerular function rate >40 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was significantly associated with the disappearance of IgA deposition.\nContext 3: Delayed graft function (DGF) is a relatively common complication after cadaveric renal transplantation. The adverse effect of DGF on long-term graft survival has lead to intensive efforts to reduce ischemic graft injury. In this study we examined the effects of a new protective treatment based on insulin growth factor (IGF)-I. We evaluated the impact of the treatment on renal recovery and on the nephrotoxicity that is a common side effect of mainstream immunosuppressants. Because therapy with IGF-I or the analog des(1-3)IGF-I is effective in treating experimental ischemic renal failure, these peptides may be useful as perspective clinical treatments.\nContext 4: The long-term prognosis of clinically early IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients remains to be clarified. We investigated the long-term outcomes of IgAN patients with an apparently benign presentation and evaluated prognostic factors for renal survival.\nContext 5: In 165 patients, anti-HLA antibodies (IgG) were detected after the PTF. Both historical and primary sensitizations were found. A DST induced donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies in 25% of the DST recipients. Our policy did not improve transplantation outcome in recipients of a kidney from a deceased donor (n = 368) or in recipients of a living donor [DST (n = 49) and mDTA (n = 19)].\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of living-donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). We retrospectively analyzed 100 patients who underwent LDKT between 1996 and 2006. The mean age was 39.5 years (range, 16-65 years). The mean follow-up period was 5.5 years (range, 1-12 years). The mean serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL (range, 0.5-2.5 mg/dL). The mean serum albumin level was 3.9 g/dL", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Insulin secretion is a complex and highly regulated process. It is well established that cytoplasmic calcium is a key regulator of insulin secretion, but how elevated intracellular calcium triggers insulin granule exocytosis remains unclear, and we have only begun to define the identities of proteins that are responsible for sensing calcium changes and for transmitting the calcium signal to release machineries. Synaptotagmins are primarily expressed in brain and endocrine cells and exhibit diverse calcium binding properties. Synaptotagmin-1, -2 and -9 are calcium sensors for fast neurotransmitter release in respective brain regions, while synaptotagmin-7 is a positive regulator of calcium-dependent insulin release. Unlike the three neuronal calcium sensors, whose deletion abolished fast neurotransmitter release, synaptotagmin-7 deletion resulted in only partial loss of calcium-dependent insulin secretion, thus suggesting that other calcium-sensors must participate in the regulation of insulin secretion. Of the other synaptotagmin isoforms that are present in pancreatic islets, the neuronal calcium sensor synaptotagmin-9 is expressed at the highest level after synaptotagmin-7.\nContext 2: In this study we tested whether synaptotagmin-9 participates in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin release by using pancreas-specific synaptotagmin-9 knockout (p-S9X) mice. Deletion of synaptotagmin-9 in the pancreas resulted in no changes in glucose homeostasis or body weight. Glucose tolerance, and insulin secretion in vivo and from isolated islets were not affected in the p-S9X mice. Single-cell capacitance measurements showed no difference in insulin granule exocytosis between p-S9X and control mice.\nContext 3: The 13-18-week-old db/db mice showed a diabetic phenotype. Isolated db/db islets showed a 77% reduction in insulin secretion induced by 15 mmol/l glucose and reductions in the amplitude and rise-time of the calcium response to glucose. Ionomycin-induced insulin secretion in WT but not db/db islets. Immunofluorescence showed an increase in the levels of the SNAREs synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) in db/db islets, but reduced syntaxin-1A. Therefore, db/db islets have both a compromised calcium response to glucose and a reduced ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose.", "Question: Are endogenous estrogen and androgen levels independent predictors of lipid levels in postmenopausal women??\nExplanation: The study found that endogenous estrogen and androgen levels were not independent predictors of lipid levels in postmenopausal women. The authors found that the relationship between endogenous estrogen and androgen levels and lipid levels was not independent of other risk factors such as age, BMI, and HOMA-IR. The authors concluded that the relationship between endogenous estrogen and androgen levels and lipid levels was not independent of other risk factors such as age, BMI, and HOMA-IR. The authors found that the relationship between endogenous estrogen and androgen levels and lipid levels was not independent of other risk factors such", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Records were reviewed to identify IgA-deficient (<0.05 mg/dL detectable IgA) apheresis PLT donors with anti-IgA. Transfusion outcomes of products from these donors were compared to outcomes of control transfusions from donors who were not IgA-deficient.\nContext 2: Four IgA-deficient donors with anti-IgA donated a total of 25 apheresis PLT products transfused to 22 recipients. Of the transfused products, 1 (4.0%) was associated with fever that was classified as unrelated to transfusion. In the control group, 60 donors donated 78 apheresis PLT products transfused to 56 recipients. Among these, an allergic reaction was identified (1.3%). The reaction rates between both groups were not different whether the single event in the anti-IgA group was considered a reaction (chi-squared value 0.735, p = 0.3914) or considered unrelated to transfusion (chi-square value 0.324, p = 0.5694).\nContext 3: We evaluated all apheresis PLT (AP) transfusions for 3 months. Using the gel titer method, we determined the anti-A and/or the anti-B immunoglobulin (Ig)G titer for all incompatible APs. Reported febrile transfusion reactions and HTRs were recorded; transfusions were not prospectively evaluated by the study team. A posttransfusion direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and eluate were performed after a reported febrile or hemolytic reaction for patients who received plasma-incompatible APs.\nContext 4: Passive transfer of antibodies through transfusion has been reported to cause adverse consequences. Approximately 1 in 700 individuals of Northern European ancestry lack IgA with up to 40 percent reported as having anti-IgA. Whether these antibodies when passively transfused were associated with reactions was examined.\nContext 5: There were 790,854 PLT transfusions during the study period (477,747 [60%] with APCs, 313,107 [40%] with PPCs). APCs were associated with more adverse reactions (6244 vs. 2469 per 1,000,000, p < 0.001) and more severe and life-threatening reactions (respectively, 241 vs. 131 per 1,000,000, p\u2009<\u20090.001). PPCs were associated with more severe reactions (respectively, 1 vs. 0.5 per 1,000,000, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and more severe reactions (respectively, 1 vs. 0.5 per 1,000,000, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and more severe reactions (respectively, 1 vs. 0.5 per 1,000,000, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and more severe reactions (respectively, 1 vs. 0.5 per 1,000,000, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and more severe reactions (respectively, 1 vs. 0", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Recently, one of our studies has revealed that the serum matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) level is elevated in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) but not in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Previous studies have demonstrated that abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AMD and PCV. MMP9 is an important regulating enzyme in ECM metabolism, and the MMP9 gene may be a candidate gene for the susceptibility of PCV and AMD. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the MMP9 gene polymorphism is associated with PCV and neovascular AMD (nAMD) in a Chinese Han population.\nContext 2: To investigate whether three previously identified variants for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants of or near the vascular endothelial growth factor A gene (VEGFA), were associated with neovascular AMD or polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in a Han Chinese cohort.\nContext 3: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs3775291) in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD in Caucasian populations. The aim of this study was to examine this association in Chinese persons with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).\nContext 4: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the genetic risk factors of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are associated with the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in highly myopic eyes of elderly Japanese.\nContext 5: We performed a case-control study in a Chinese Han population. Three tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs17576, rs3787268 and rs2274755) of the MMP9 gene were genotyped in 251 patients with PCV, 157 patients with nAMD, and 204 control individuals using the Multiplex SNaPshot system and the direct DNA sequencing technique. The three SNPs genotypes and allele frequencies in the PCV, nAMD and control groups were evaluated using PLINK software and binary logistic regression analysis.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in 250 words or less.\n\nThe study found that the MMP9 gene polymorphism is associated with PCV and nAMD in a Chinese Han population.

The primary aim of this study was to assess whether fibrinogen concentration at admission before labour is associated with severe postpartum haemorrhage. Secondary aims were to describe fibrinogen concentration before and after labour and to identify predictors for severe postpartum haemorrhage.\nContext 2: 1951 healthy women were included in a prospective observational study. Fibrinogen concentration was determined at admission to the labour ward and in a subgroup of women (n=80) also after the placenta was delivered. Bleeding volume postpartum was estimated by weighing surgical sponges and pads and by measuring collected blood. Predictors for severe postpartum haemorrhage (>1000 ml) were identified with bivariate and multivariate regression analyses.\nContext 3: Mean fibrinogen concentration was 5.3 (SD 0.8) g litre(-) (1). Median estimated blood loss was 450 (range 70-4400) ml and 250 (12.8%) women bled >1000 ml. Fibrinogen concentration was not correlated with postpartum haemorrhage in the entire cohort (r(s)=0.003, P=0.90) or in any subgroup. Fibrinogen concentration was not associated with bleeding >1000 ml (odds ratio 1.01 (CI 95% 0.85-1.19), P=0.93) and did not differ significantly before and after delivery. Oxytocin stimulation, instrumental delivery, Caesarean section and exploration of uterus were identified as independent predictors of haemorrhage >1000 ml.\nContext 4: Fibrinogen concentrate is increasingly considered as a hemostatic agent for trauma patients experiencing bleeding. Placing a venous access is sometimes challenging during severe hemorrhage. Intraosseous access may be considered instead. Studies of intraosseous infusion of coagulation factor concentrates are limited. We investigated in vivo recovery following intraosseous administration of fibrinogen concentrate and compared the results with intravenous administration.\nContext 5: Placental fibrin deposits in patients wih recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) indicate an exaggerated haemostatic response. This 'hypercoagulability' may involve pro-coagulant factors such as circulating microparticles (MPs).

To determine the mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance in PC-3-TxR cells, we compared the gene expression profiles between PC-3 and PC-3-TxR cells. Our results indicated that expression of the C-terminal tensin like protein (CTEN, tensin 4) gene was down-regulated by 10-fold in PC-3-TxR cells. We investigated the possibility that CTEN overexpression restores paclitaxel sensitivity.\nContext 2: We investigated how knockdown and overexpression of CTEN in androgen-independent cell lines affect paclitaxel sensitivity by colony formation assay and growth inhibition assay. To determine the mechanisms by which CTEN affects paclitaxel sensitivity, we investigated the relationships between CTEN and F-actin or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in PC-3 cells. We also examined the association between expression of CTEN and grade of prostate cancer by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray analysis.\nContext 3: Prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts with known PTEN status (22RV1-PTEN(+/+), DU145-PTEN(+/-), PC3-PTEN(-/-)) and H1299 and HCT116 cancer cells were used to evaluate how PTEN loss affects RAD51 expression and PARPi sensitivity. Primary prostate cancers with known PTEN status were analyzed for RAD51 expression.\nContext 4: PTEN status is not associated with reduced RAD51 mRNA or protein expression in primary prostate cancers. Decreased PTEN expression did not reduce RAD51 expression or clonogenic survival following PARPi among prostate cancer cells that vary in TP53 and PTEN. PARPi sensitivity instead associated with a defect in MRE11 expression. PTEN-deficient cells had only mild PARPi sensitivity and no loss of HR or RAD51 recruitment. Clonogenic cell survival following a series of DNA damaging agents was variable: PTEN-deficient cells were sensitive to ionizing radiation, mitomycin-C, UV, H(2)O(2), and methyl methanesulfonate but not to cisplatin, camptothecin, or paclitaxel.\nContext 5: Down-regulation of CTEN, which is located in the cytoskeleton, played an important role in paclitaxel resistance in PC-3-TxR cells. Knockdown of CTEN in PC-3 cells resulted in a significant increase in paclitaxel sensitivity. Overexpression of CTEN in PC-3 cells resulted in a significant decrease in paclitaxel sensitivity. The results of this study suggest that CTEN may be a potential target for the treatment of paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to investigate the role of CTEN in paclitaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells. We found that knockdown of CTEN in PC-3 cells resulted in a significant increase in paclitaxel sensitivity. Overexpression of CTEN in PC-", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Distal somatic polyneuropathy is a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of chronic foot infections and ulcers, and may lead to lower limb amputations. Both metabolic and vascular abnormalities may contribute to the development of impaired nerve function. We therefore assessed the association between hyperhomocysteinaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and polyneuropathy.\nContext 2: The prevalence of any polyneuropathy was 12.4% (33 of 266) in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 12.6% (21 of 167) in those with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 25.3% (41 of 162) in those with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of definite polyneuropathy was 2.6% (7 of 266) in subjects with NGT, 2.4% (4 of 167) in those with IGT and 8.7% (14 of 161) in type 2 diabetic subjects. Polyneuropathy was associated with known risk factors such as diabetes, hyperglycaemia and body height. After adjustment for age, sex, HbA1c and hypertension, the odds ratio (95% CI) for any polyneuropathy per 5 micromol L-1 (about 1 SD) serum total homocysteine increment was 1.00 (0.72-1.39). After adjustment for age and sex, it was 0.62 (0.21-1.89) for definite polyneuropathy.\nContext 3: We studied an age-, sex- and glucose-tolerance-stratified random sample of a 50- to 75-year-old general Caucasian population in the Hoorn Study (N = 629). Any polyneuropathy (N = 95) was defined as the absence of at least two of the three following sensory modalities or reflexes of either foot: light touch sense, ankle reflex and vibration sensation. Definite polyneuropathy (N = 25) was present if, in addition, the vibration perception threshold of the right big toe was abnormal.\nContext 4: Hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic and thrombotic vascular disease. In many patients, hyperhomocysteinemia can be treated or prevented by dietary supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12. We studied the prevalence of polyneuropathy in a population-based sample of 50- to 75-year-old subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes.\nContext 5: We studied 266 subjects with NGT, 167 with IGT and 162 with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of any polyneuropathy was 12.4% (33 of 266), 12.6% (21 of 167) and 25.3% (41 of 162), respectively. The prevalence of definite polyneuropathy was 2.6% (7 of 266),", "Question: Does voice activity and participation profile presenting coordinate for readjustment of preventive action of educators??\nExplanation: The VAPP data showed that self-perception of voice problems had a higher vocal impact on daily communication and lower scores for activity limitation and participation restriction. The educators' scores were closer to those of the nondysphonic group with regard to daily and social communication, and emotional and activity limitation, but perception of the voice problem was closest to that of the dysphonic group. Nevertheless, the opposite was the case for participation restriction.\nContext 3: Referral to voice therapy and recommendations for voice rest and microphone use are common interventions in occupational medicine aimed at preserving the working capability of teachers with occupation-related voice problems. Research on", "Contexts:\nContext 1: It has been demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through an estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathway. Both ER subtypes, classical ER (ERalpha) and the newly identified ER subtype (ERbeta), are expressed in VSMCs. However, it remains unknown which receptor plays the critical role in the inhibitory effect on VSMC proliferation.\nContext 2: There is controversy on whether estrogen receptors are present and functioning in the myocardium. Aims. To explore if after myocardial infarction (MI) estrogen receptors \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) are upregulated in myocardial tissue and to explore if the presence/ absence of ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 influences angiogenesis after MI.\nContext 3: Atherosclerosis is a multigenic process leading to the progressive occlusion of arteries of mid to large caliber. A key step of the atherogenic process is the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells into the intimal layer of the arterial conduit. The phenotype of smooth muscle cells, once within the intima, is known to switch from contractile to de-differentiated, yet the regulation of this switch at the genomic level is unknown. Estrogen has been shown to regulate cell proliferation both for cancer cells and for vascular cells. However, methylation of the estrogen receptor-alpha gene (ERalpha) promoter blocks the expression of ERalpha, and thereby can antagonize the regulatory effect of estrogen on cell proliferation. We sought to determine whether methylation of the ERalpha is differentially and selectively regulated in contractile versus de-differentiated arterial smooth muscle cells.\nContext 4: Estrogens have atheroprotective properties, the mechanisms of which remain obscure. Estrogens have recently been reported to increase endothelial NO synthase expression in castrated animals and to prevent the degradation of NO by decreasing superoxide anion production in cultured endothelial cells. In both cases, increased NO bioavailability would promote vasodilation, inhibit proliferation of the adjacent vascular smooth muscle, reduce platelet aggregation, and inhibit monocyte adhesion to the endothelium and the inflammatory reaction induced by cytokines, all key contributors in the development of atherosclerosis.\nContext 5: TGF-\u03b21 induced elastogenesis in rat urethral smooth muscle cells. This effect was partially blocked by estrogen and completely abrogated by SB-431542, a selective inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 receptor I. The present study was designed to determine the role of estrogen in the regulation of TGF-\u03b21-induced elastogenesis in rat urethral smooth muscle cells.\nContext 6: Estrogen has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. However, the mechanisms by which estrogen inhibits VSMC proliferation are not well understood. The present study was designed to determine the effect of estrogen on the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and to determine the role of estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 and ER\u03b2 in the inhibitory effect of estrogen on VSMC proliferation.\nContext 7: Estrogen has been shown to inhibit", "Yes, neurotensin serum levels and skin gene expression are increased in atopic dermatitis.\n\nExplanation: Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-amino acid peptide that is widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). NT is a potent neuropeptide that is released from the hypothalamus and the brainstem and acts on the CNS and PNS. NT is also released from the adrenal medulla and the adrenal cortex. NT is a potent stimulator of the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus and the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pit", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on affective experience in healthy older adults.\nContext 2: After 1 week of observation, normal elderly volunteers (age range: 65-84 years) were given placebo, paroxetine (10 mg-40 mg/day), or sertraline (50 mg-150 mg/day) for 3 weeks in a double-blind study. Paroxetine- and sertraline-treated subjects were analyzed together as the SSRI group (N=30). Volunteers were assessed weekly and recorded mood and events in a daily diary each evening. All data were analyzed with mixed-effects random-regression models.\nContext 3: There were significant relationships between daily affect and events reported in the daily diary for the sample as a whole, with no differences between groups in mean slopes of positive or negative affect across the length of the study. There were no differences between groups in affective variability. However, the SSRI group, but not the placebo group, demonstrated a significant drug-dependent decrease in negative affect related to negative events. There were no other observed group differences on any other measure.\nContext 4: Depression is emerging as an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor. We investigated whether treating depression in older participants impacted on arterial stiffness, a known cardiovascular disease risk factor and a clinical marker of arterial aging.\nContext 5: Patients using antidepressant pharmacotherapy at baseline and follow-up tended to be younger and female (p\u22640.01), but were similar in various clinical characteristics. Just 24% (63/259) of patients were on an antidepressant at baseline which increased to 36% at follow-up (94/259). Compared to other groups, patients on antidepressants at both baseline and follow-up assessment showed the smallest improvement in mood symptoms and HRQoL. While multivariate analyses confirmed that randomization to collaborative care was associated with greater improvement in mood symptoms (odds ratio [OR]=3.1; 95%-confidence interval [CI]=1.8-5.4, p<0.0001) and mental HRQoL (OR=3.6, CI=1.4-9.3, p=0.01), use of antidepressant medication had no differential impact on either measure (p=0.06 and p=0.92, respectively).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short answer (1-2 sentences) for each context. If you are unsure about the context, please refer to the context section above.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We therefore investigated the relationship between obesity and lower extremity fractures in different age and fracture locations in a stable population.\nContext 2: A number of studies have found an increased risk of lower extremity injuries in obese patients. Most studies, however, are unable to provide stable population-based estimates based on the degree of obesity and few assess the risk pertaining to more detailed fracture location in the lower extremities.\nContext 3: Overweight, moderately obese, and extremely obese patients all had an increased OR of fractures of the foot (OR, 1.14, 1.23, and 1.42, respectively, with 95% CI, 1.04-1.24, 1.12-1.35, and 1.26-1.61, respectively) along with the ankle, knee, and leg (OR, 1.27, 1.28, and 1.51, respectively, with 95% CI, 1.16-1.39, 1.15-1.42, and 1.33-1.72, respectively). The association was strongest in the 6- to 11-year-old age group. We found no association between increasing BMI and increased risk of fractures of the femur and hip.\nContext 4: This cohort study of 1,614 postmenopausal Japanese women followed for 6.7\u00a0years showed that overweight/obesity and underweight are both risk factors for fractures at different sites. Fracture risk assessment may be improved if fracture sites are taken into account and BMI is categorized.\nContext 5: This is a population-based, cross-sectional study from the electronic medical records of 913,178 patients aged 2 to 19\u00a0years. The body mass index (BMI) for each patient in the cohort was used to stratify patients into five weight classes (underweight, normal weight, overweight, moderate obesity, and extreme obesity) based on BMI for age. Records were assessed for the occurrence of lower extremity fractures for each cohort member. The associations among the five weight classes and specific lower extremity fractures were estimated using multiple logistic regression models and expressed with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariate analysis to adjust for patient demographic variables.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\n1.

Recently, pitted cell count was shown to be increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease, and also to be associated with an increased susceptibility to infection. Therefore, our aim in the present study was to assess splenic function in a group of patients with cirrhosis and to determine its possible role in the development of infections.\nContext 2: Partial splenic embolization or splenectomy has been reported to improve liver function as well as hypersplenism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of splenectomy in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) on liver function.\nContext 3: Splenic function was assessed during hospitalization in 44 patients diagnosed as having cirrhosis, and was compared to 18 healthy subjects. Function was evaluated by counting the number of pitted cells in peripheral blood films. Results were the mean value of two independent counts and were expressed as number of pitted cells/100 erythrocytes.\nContext 4: Hypersplenism was improved in all patients. Protein synthesis in the liver was improved, which significantly correlated with these patients' increased liver volume. Having a large spleen and a low serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are predictive factors for favorable improvement of liver function after splenectomy. Splenectomy was safely carried out in all patients without major complications except for portal thrombus occurred in 4 patients, but did not affect liver function if it was well treated.\nContext 5: More than half of the patients had cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. The main finding was a progressive increase in the volume of the spared hemiliver (mean absolute increase at T3: 230\u2009ml). The percentage of patients in whom the baseline ratio of spared volume to total liver volume was <40% dropped from 56.6% at baseline to 29.4% at T2 (P < 0.001). A significant and progressive increase in spleen volume but not in portal vein diameter was also observed. A small percentage of patients developed hypersplenism, mostly those without cirrhosis (16.0% at T2). Six patients (five with portal vein thrombosis, cirrhosis or both) developed signs of portal hypertension by T2.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\nYes, splenectomy improves liver function in patients with cirrhosis.\nNo, splenectomy does not improve liver function in patients with cirrhosis.\nMaybe, splenectomy may improve liver function in patients with cirrhosis.\nNo, splenectomy does not improve liver function in patients with cirrhosis.\nNo, splenectomy does not improve liver function in patients with cirrhosis.\n\n## Context 1: Pitted cell count has been described as a sensitive marker of splenic function.

In aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), asthmatic symptoms are precipitated by ingestion of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs capable for pharmacologic inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 isoenzyme. We investigated whether aspirin-provoked bronchoconstriction is accompanied by changes of isoprostanes in exhaled breath condensate (EBC).\nContext 2: Before the challenge, exhaled 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, 8-iso-PGE2, and PGE2 levels did not differ between the study groups. 8-iso-PGE2 level increased in AERD group only (p=0.014) as a result of the aspirin challenge. Urinary LTE4 was elevated in AERD, both in baseline and post-challenge samples. Post-challenge airways 8-iso-PGE2 correlated positively with urinary LTE4 level (p=0.046), whereas it correlated negatively with the provocative dose of aspirin (p=0.027).\nContext 3: EBC was collected from 28 AERD subjects and 25 aspirin-tolerant asthmatics before and after inhalatory aspirin challenge. Concentrations of 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, 8-iso-PGE2, and prostaglandin E2 were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Leukotriene E4 was measured by immunoassay in urine samples collected before and after the challenge.\nContext 4: The clinical records of 207 asthmatic patients who underwent inhalation challenges with both aspirin and methacholine were reviewed retrospectively. An oral aspirin challenge was performed in patients with a negative inhalation response. The bronchial reactivity index (BRindex) was calculated from the percent decrease in lung function divided by the last dose of the stimulus.\nContext 5: Patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and/or nasal polyps (n = 40), patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma and/or nasal polyps (n = 13) and healthy volunteers (n = 26) were included.

During a 24-h fasting tolerance test, the twin with KH showed hypoglycemia (blood glucose 2.0 mmol/liter) after 18 h. Three h before the occurrence of hypoglycemia, he had had 10 times higher beta-hydroxybutyrate levels than his brother, who showed no signs of hypoglycemia. Their glucose production rates were normal and similar (23.3 and 21.7 micromol/kg body weight per minute in the healthy and KH twin, respectively) as well as their lipolysis rates (5.8 and 6.8 micromol/kg body weight per minute, respectively). During repeated 60-min infusions of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate increased 5-10 times more in the twin with KH (mean 1.1 mmol/liter in the healthy and 10.8 mmol/liter in the KH twin), indicating a disturbed clearance or metabolism of beta-hydroxybutyrate. No mutations were found in genes involved in ketone body metabolism or transport.\nContext 2: Childhood ketotic hypoglycemia (KH) is a disease characterized by fasting hypoglycemia and increased levels of ketone bodies. The cause is unknown.\nContext 3: The objective of the study was to study a pair of homozygotic twin boys, one of whom had severe KH from the age of 14 months, whereas the other boy was apparently healthy.\nContext 4: Loss of function mutations in the genes encoding the pancreatic \u03b2-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel are identified in approximately 80% of patients with diazoxide unresponsive hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH). For a small number of patients HH can occur as part of a multisystem disease such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). In approximately 20% of patients, BWS results from chromosome 11 paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), which causes dysregulation of imprinted growth regulation genes at 11p15.5. There is a considerable range in the clinical features and phenotypic severity associated with BWS which is likely to be due to somatic mosaicism. The cause of HH in these patients is not known.\nContext 5: We report a 2-year-old boy with severe diazoxide unresponsive HH and BWS. He was diagnosed at 14 months of age with severe KH. He was treated with diazoxide and insulin. At 2 years of age, he was diagnosed with BWS. He was treated with diazoxide and insulin. At 2 years of age, he was diagnosed with BWS.

Bovine chondrocytes were characterized by use of a particle exclusion assay, in-situ hybridization, quantitative-competitive RT-PCR and a hyaluronan-binding assay.\nContext 4: To ascertain if rhOP-1 enhances the formation of the cell-associated matrix (CM) and the characteristics of CM formation, bovine articular chondrocytes were first cultured for up to 14 days in alginate beads in medium supplemented with serum, with or without rhOP-1. Then, the recovered chondrocytes and their associated CM were resuspended in medium, with or without OP-1, seeded onto culture inserts, and incubated for an additional 14 days. The fabricated ARC tissues were subjected to biochemical and histological analyses.\nContext 5: This study aims to investigate the regulation of expression of Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which is predominately expressed by chondrocytes and functions to organize the extracellular matrix. Mutations in COMP cause two skeletal dysplasias: pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. The mechanism controlling COMP expression during chondrocyte differentiation is still poorly understood.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does osteogenic protein-1 promote the synthesis and retention of extracellular matrix within bovine articular cartilage and chondrocytes?\nYes, no, maybe\nExplanation:\nOsteogenic protein-1 (rhOP-1) is a recombinant protein that is capable of inducing the synthesis and retention of extracellular matrix within cartilage and chondrocytes. The protein is capable of inducing the synthesis of type II collagen, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans. The protein also induces the expression of genes that are involved in the synthesis of type II collagen and proteoglycans.

This study aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-21 levels with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF).\nContext 2: Serum FGF-21 levels were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls (250.12\u00b178.48 vs. 144.15\u00b156.31pg/mL, P<0.001), and hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls (2.36\u00b11.10 vs. 1.24\u00b10.82, P<0.05). In subgroup studies, patients with permanent AF had higher serum FGF-21 levels than those with persistent and paroxysmal AF. After the adjustment of the age, gender and body mass index, serum FGF-21 levels were positively correlated with left atrial diameter (LAD) (P<0.01). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that FGF-21, LAD and hs-CRP were correlated with AF (P<0.05).\nContext 3: Collagen turnover and atrial fibrosis have been implicated in the generation and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation (AF). We evaluated the importance of serum markers of collagen turnover in predicting the outcome of electrical cardioversion (CV) of persistent AF and the relationship between AF and fibrosis.\nContext 4: Elevated levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) are commonly encountered in type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, all of which share exaggerated postprandial lipemia as a common proatherogenic feature. How FGF21 responds to an oral fat load in man is unknown.\nContext 5: The study group consisted of 81 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation undergoing elective external cardioversion. Blood samples were taken immediately prior to the procedure. Soluble E-Selectin, P-Selectin, intra-cellular adhesion molecule and vascular cell adhesion molecule were assayed using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique (R&D systems) and high sensitivity C reactive protein was measured by rate nephelometry. Patients were reviewed at 8 weeks and bloods were taken at this time.\n\nBased on the contexts above, the following conclusions were drawn:\n1. Serum FGF-21 levels were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls (250.12\u00b178.48 vs. 144.15\u00b156.31pg/mL, P<0.001), and hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in AF patients than in controls (2.36\u00b11.10 vs. 1.24\u00b10.82, P<0.05).

Nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured by Griess reagent and ELISA. The mRNA and protein levels of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines were analysed by ELISA, RT-PCR and double immunofluorescence labeling, respectively. Phosphorylation levels of Akt, cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) cascades, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and expression of SIRT1(Silent information regulator T1) were measured by western blot. Wortmannin (1 \u00b5M), a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, was used to determine if PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway might be involved in resveratrol's action on RAW 264.7 cells. Resveratrol significantly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in RAW 264.7 cells. Resveratrol increased Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Wortmannin, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, blocked the effects of resveratrol on LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells activation. In addition, PI3-K inhibition partially abolished the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) cascades. Meanwhile, PI3-K is essential for resveratrol-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK and expression of SIRT1.\nContext 2: Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic compound that has cardioprotective, anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated the capacity of resveratrol to protect RAW 264.7 cells from inflammatory insults and explored mechanisms underlying inhibitory effects of resveratrol on RAW 264.7 cells activation. Resveratrol significantly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in RAW 264.7 cells.

In this paper we investigate de novo deletions defined as DNA segments missing in an oral cleft proband but present in both unaffected parents. We compare de novo deletion frequencies in children of European ancestry with an isolated, non-syndromic oral cleft to frequencies in children of European ancestry from randomly sampled trios.\nContext 1: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are one of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Autonomic dysreflexia is a common and potentially dangerous response in patients with spinal cord injury at T6 or above. Acute blood pressure elevation may be precipitated by rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation. Topical anesthetics are widely recommended to minimize the incidence and severity of autonomic dysreflexia, although no scientific evidence supports or refutes this practice. This study tested whether topical lidocaine would prevent or limit anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.\nContext 2: Recent reports of major and minor neurologic sequelae after spinal anesthesia have generated concern regarding the safety of some currently used intrathecal agents. The role of glucose, if any, in neurotoxic injury associated with spinal anesthesia is not known. The current experiments sought to determine whether the presence of 7.5% glucose alters the neurotoxicity of intrathecally administered 5% lidocaine.\nContext 3: Although it has been suggested that the dilution of 5% hyperbaric lidocaine before injection for spinal anesthesia may decrease the incidence of transient neurologic symptoms, previous studies have not noted a decreased incidence between 5% and 2% lidocaine. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the incidence of transient neurologic symptoms could be altered by further diluting spinal lidocaine from 2.0% to 0.5%.\nContext 4: This randomized, double-blind trial studied 40 men undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia. All patients received 19 mL of lidocaine 1% infiltrated in the operative field before incision. Patients were randomized into two groups of 20. The surgical site group received ketorolac 30 mg added to the lidocaine infiltration. In the control group, ketorolac 30 mg was injected subcutaneously in the contralateral abdominal wall. Numeric rating scores (0-10) of pain at rest and with movement were recorded at the time of discharge from the recovery room and at 24 hr postoperatively. Time to first analgesia, postoperative iv morphine use, total time in the recovery room, and total oral analgesic use in the first 24 hr were also compared.\nContext 5: We enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury scheduled for anoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy. In a double-blind fashion they were randomized to receive either 2% lidocaine or 2% bupivacaine for the procedure. The primary outcome was the incidence of postprocedure pain. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postprocedure nausea and vomiting, the incidence of postprocedure urinary retention, and the incidence of postprocedure ileus.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of 2% lidocaine to 2% bupivacaine would decrease the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. A total of 100 patients were randomized to receive either 2% lidocaine or 2% bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

Though their multiple functions have been well characterized, there is no report about the association between the polymorphisms of HSP22 and heat tolerance.\nContext 2: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in HSP22 from scallop Chlamys farreri (CfHSP22), and the +94 C-A locus was found to be nonsynonymous. Three genotypes at locus +94, A/A, A/C and C/C, were revealed by using Bi-PASA PCR analysis, and their frequencies were 19.5%, 27.6% and 52.9% in the heat resistant stock, while 9.3%, 17.4% and 73.3% in the heat susceptible stock, respectively. The frequency differences of the three genotypes were significant (P<0.05) between the two stocks. After incubating at 30\u00b0C for 84 h, the cumulative mortality of scallops with +94 C/C genotype and +94 A/C genotypes was 95% and 90%, respectively, which was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of scallops with +94 A/A genotype (70%). The molecular chaperone activity of two His-tagged fusion proteins, rCfHSP22Q with +94 C/C genotype and rCfHSP22K with +94 A/A genotype were analyzed by testing the ability of protecting citrate synthase (CS) against thermal inactivation in vitro. After incubated with rCfHSP22Q or rCfHSP22K at 38\u00b0C for 1 h, the activity of CS lost 50% and 45%, and then recovered to 89% and 95% of the original activity following 1 h restoration at 22\u00b0C, respectively, indicating that the mutation from Gln to Lys at this site might have an impact on molecular chaperone activities of CfHSP22.\nContext 3: All genotypes were distributed according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between genotypes of rs1805192 variants and decreased SLE risk, after adjustment for sex, age, smoking, high-fat diet, low-fibre diet, alcohol status, body mass index and waist circumference. Participants with Ala allesles had a lower SLE risk than those homozygous for the G allele (OR=0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.89, P=0.007). The results of this study suggest that the rs1805192 polymorphism of HSP22 may be associated with the risk of SLE.\nConclusion: The results of this study suggest that the rs1805192 polymorphism of HSP22 may be associated with the risk of SLE.\nKeywords: Heat shock protein 22; Heat tolerance; Scallop; HSP22; Heat shock protein 22; Heat tolerance; Scallop; HSP22; Heat shock protein 22; Heat tolerance; Scallop; HSP22; Heat shock protein 22; Heat tolerance;", "Question: Is symptom-oriented follow-up of early breast cancer inferior to conventional control.

However, there was considerable individual variation and only some participants scored significantly above chance on both tasks. The interview revealed that although this study took longer to complete, there were many positive aspects of working collaboratively. All the researchers gained personally and professionally from their involvement. Of particular interest was the realization that the researcher with aphasia had a greater ability to plan, problem solve and develop ideas than was initially thought.\nContext 2: The first aim was to investigate whether people without aphasia and without training could match the adapted version of BLISS to pictures. The second aim was to conduct collaborative research involving researchers with and without aphasia and to explore their experiences.\nContext 3: Since his stroke 15 years ago, Tony O'Donnell has worked with BLISS, a symbolic, graphical language. BLISS has been used with a variety of clinical populations, including people with severe aphasia. O'Donnell found his adapted version of BLISS was meaningful to him when spoken and written English was not. The present study is part of a larger project that investigated the validity and generality of O'Donnell's belief that his adapted system would be useful for people with severe aphasia.\nContext 4: Patients with isolated aphasia in the absence of other cognitive abnormalities have been the focus of several studies during the past decade. It has been called primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and the typical features of this syndrome are marked atrophy of the left temporal lobe according to the radiological examination and a language disorder as the initial symptom. In previous studies of PPA, the selection of the patients was based mainly on linguistic symptoms. Now, when computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are part of the routine investigation of cognitive impairment and suspected dementia, the patients with lobar atrophy will be found at an earlier stage. In the present study, we used a new approach and defined the study group by selecting patients with obvious left temporal lobe atrophy, assessed by MRI, and we referred to them as patients with temporal lobe atrophy (TLA).\nContext 5: To relate fractional anisotropy (FA) changes associated with the semantic and logopenic variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) to measures of lexical retrieval.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the text.\nThe researchers found that the participants with aphasia could match the adapted version of BLISS to pictures.

Biological parameters and HB-EGF, IL-18, and IL-10 levels were measured. Patients in the restenosis group were further divided into 3 subgroups according to Gensini score: group A (Gensini score of <20), group B (Gensini score of \u226520 but <40), and group C (Gensini score of \u226540).\nContext 2: The results obtained in this study showed that the frequency of the three polymorphisms studied was similar in patients with and without restenosis. Univariate analysis showed that the use of drug-eluting stent (DES) reduces the risk of developing restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26). In contrast, the diameter<2.5mm of the stent and bifurcations increased the risk of developing restenosis (p=0.049, OR=1.74 and p=0.041, OR=1.8).\nContext 3: The clinical importance of complete blood count (CBC) parameters such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown in cardiovascular diseases. Stent restenosis (SR) is a major adverse event after stent implantation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of CBC parameters with SR rates after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nContext 4: At 6 months, quantitative computer-assisted angiographic analysis in 133 patients with stents showed a binary restenosis rate of 33.8%. Statins were being taken by 80% of the patients. There were no significant differences between the pre- or postprocedure values of CRP, SAA, or IL-6 in patients with or without in-stent restenosis.\nContext 5: Compared with the non-restenosis group, HB-EGF and IL-18 levels were significantly higher but serum IL-10 levels were significantly lower in the restenosis group. Furthermore, HB-EGF levels increased with the Gensini score among the 3 subgroups. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that HB-EGF levels were associated with IL-18 levels and the number of diseased vessels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HB-EGF levels were an independent risk factor for restenosis.\nContext 6: The results of this study showed that the use of DES reduces the risk of developing restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26).

For each of 24 symptoms, experience of distress, type of coping and the resulting degree of perceived control were assessed. Coping types were reduced to two contrasting coping categories: symptomatic coping (SC) and non-symptomatic coping (NSC; combining active problem solving, passive illness behaviour, active problem avoiding, and passive problem avoiding). Cognitive functioning was assessed using the GIT (Groninger Intelligence Test), the Zoo map (BADS: Behavioural Assessment of Dysexecutive function), Stroop-test and Trail making.\nContext 3: Executive function impairment, as classically assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sort Test or intradimensional/extradimensional tests, is a key feature of schizophrenia but remains inadequately treated by existing therapies. Recently, however, erythropoietin has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in schizophrenic patients.\nContext 4: The underlying nature of negative symptoms in psychosis is poorly understood. Investigation of the relationship between the different negative subsymptoms and neurocognition is one approach to understand more of the underlying nature. Apathy, one of the subsymptoms, is also a common symptom in other brain disorders. Its association with neurocognition, in particular executive functioning, is well documented in other brain disorders, but only studied in one former study of chronic patients with schizophrenia. This study investigates the association between apathy and neurocognitive functioning in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), with the hypothesis that apathy is more associated with tests representing executive function than tests representing other neurocognitive domains.\nContext 5: Patients demonstrated a significantly reduced anterior cingulate cognitive activation. Significantly differing associations of anterior cingulate activation and cortical thickness were found in a pattern of dorsolateral prefrontal, superior frontal-anterior cingulate, and superior temporal cortical regions, where patients but not healthy control subjects demonstrated a significant association of reduced anterior cingulate activation and cortical thinning.

Because exposure to sub-therapeutic concentrations of anticancer drugs such as nilotinib may result in selection of resistant clones and ultimately relapse, we studied the effect of a calcium carbonate supplement (Tums Ultra 1000\u00ae) on nilotinib pharmacokinetics.\nContext 2: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study was conducted in 110 young girls. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive 500 mg Ca/d as calcium carbonate or placebo for 1 y. Two groups of girls were selected according to habitual calcium intake from a large group; one group consumed 1000-1304 mg/d (40th-60th percentile; n = 60) and the other group consumed <713 mg/d (<20th percentile; n = 50). Height, body weight, body fat, and calcium intake were measured at baseline and after 1 y.\nContext 3: There have been concerns about the possible prothrombotic effects of nilotinib, especially in patients having cardiovascular risk factors. The potential mechanism behind the increased risk of thromboembolic events is still not clear.\nContext 4: There were no statistically significant effects of calcium supplementation on weight [+0.14 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.28, +0.57 kg], height (+0.22 cm; 95% CI, -0.30, +0.74 cm), body fat (SMD, +0.04; 95% CI, -0.08, +0.15), or lean mass (SMD, +0.14; 95% CI, -0.03, +0.31).\nContext 5: A repeated-measures ANOVA showed there was no significant (P = 0.2) time \u00d7 vitamin D treatment \u00d7 calcium intake grouping interaction effect on the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration over the 15-wk intervention period. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased (P \u2264 0.005) and decreased (P \u2264 0.05) in the placebo and calcium groups, respectively. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly higher (P \u2264 0.05) in the calcium group than in the placebo group at 6 and 12 wk.\nContext 6: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation on the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to investigate the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with T2DM.\nContext 7: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation on", "No, keratinocyte growth factor does not improve lung allograft survival in the rat.\nExplanation: Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of growth factors.

In multivariate logistic-regression analyses, we added covariates derived from parenchymal, vascular, and perfusion imaging to the 6-parameter model of the ASTRAL score. If a specific imaging covariate remained an independent predictor of three-month modified Rankin score>2, the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of this new model was calculated and compared with ASTRAL score's AUC. We also performed similar logistic regression analyses in arbitrarily chosen patient subgroups.\nContext 4: When added to the ASTRAL score, the following covariates on admission computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging-based multimodal imaging were not significant predictors of outcome: any stroke-related acute lesion, any nonstroke-related lesions, chronic/subacute stroke, leukoaraiosis, significant arterial pathology in ischemic territory on computed tomography angiography/magnetic resonance angiography/Doppler, significant intracranial arterial pathology in ischemic territory, and focal hypoperfusion on perfusion-computed tomography. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score on plain imaging and any significant extracranial arterial pathology on computed tomography angiography/magnetic resonance angiography/Doppler were independent predictors of outcome (odds ratio: 0\u00b793, 95% CI: 0\u00b787-0\u00b799 and odds ratio: 1\u00b749, 95% CI: 1\u00b708-2\u00b705, respectively) but did not increase ASTRAL score's AUC (0\u00b7849 vs. 0\u00b7850, and 0\u00b78563 vs. 0\u00b78564, respectively). In exploratory analyses in subgroups of different prognosis, age or stroke severity, no covariate was found to increase ASTRAL score's AUC, either.\nContext 5: At 1 year from injury, 26 patients (76%) had recovered consciousness and eight patients (24%) had not. In univariate analyses, a detectable P300, a reactive EEG and lower DRS scores were found at entry assessment more frequently (p < 0.05) in patients who later recovered consciousness than in those who did not. In multivariate analyses, a detectable P300, a reactive EEG and lower DRS scores were found to be independent predictors of recovery of consciousness (odds ratio: 0\u00b727, 95% CI: 0\u00b708-0\u00b789 and odds ratio: 0\u00b727, 95% CI: 0\u00b708-0\u00b789, respectively). In exploratory analyses, a detectable P300, a reactive EEG and lower DRS scores were found to be independent predictors of recovery of consciousness (odds ratio: 0\u00b727, 95% CI: 0\u00b708-0\u00b789 and odds ratio: 0\u00b727, 95% CI: 0\u00b7", "Question: Is tumor necrosis factor-alpha from resident lung cells a key initiating factor in pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury??\nYes, tumor necrosis factor-alpha from resident lung cells is a key initiating factor in pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted mainly by macrophages under various conditions. We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor-alpha from resident lung cells is a key initiating factor in pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury. We used an isolated, buffer-perfused lung system to explore the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by resident lung cells in pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury.

It is possible that individual differences in decision-making (DM) abilities may influence these associations.\nContext 2: This study analyzed how amount of cannabis use, DM performance, and the interaction of these variables influenced BMI and clinical classifications of weight among adolescents (ages 14 to 18 years; 56% male; 77% Hispanic). The sample consisted primarily of cannabis users (n=238) without a history of significant developmental disorders, birth complications, neurological conditions, or history of mood, thought, or attention", "Question: Do simple flaps for reconstruction of pediatric scalp defects after electrical burn??\nYes, simple flaps are adequate for reconstruction of scalp defects after electrical burn.\nThe most common type of flap used for reconstruction of scalp defects after electrical burn is the split-thickness skin graft (STSG). STSG is a simple flap that is harvested from the donor site and transposed to the defect. The donor site is usually the forearm or the antecubital fossa. The STSG is harvested in a split-thickness manner, which means that the skin is divided into two layers, the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is then removed from the donor site and transposed to the defect. The dermis is", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Adipocytes accumulated in the visceral area change their function to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion with concomitant matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 induction in mice. This study was performed to clarify the role of macrophages (Mphi)-secreted MMP on the functional changes in adipocytes using a culture system.\nContext 2: Obesity is currently viewed as a state of chronic low-grade inflammation in which there is a pro-inflammatory alteration in the serum adipocytokine profile as well as an infiltration of white adipose tissue by activated macrophages. The etiology of this inflammation, however, is poorly understood.\nContext 3: Mphi-conditioned media (Mphi-CM) increased the levels of TNF-alpha mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and these adipocyte responses were abolished by treatment with GM6001, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, or NNGH (N-isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-glycylhydroxamic acid), an MMP-3 inhibitor. The activated form of MMP-3 enhanced glycerol release as well as TNF-alpha protein secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The incubation of adipocytes with MMP-3 inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes. Furthermore, a high-fat intake increased the expression of MMP-3, decreased the insulin-induced glucose uptake of adipocytes and induced expression of F4/80 in mesenteric fat tissue of C57BL/6 mice.\nContext 4: Adipose tissue is infiltrated by an increasing number of macrophages during the development of obesity. These immune cells are suspected to be a major source of TNF-\u03b1 that interferes with adipocyte function. Because lycopene possesses anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesize that lycopene could reduce the production of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages and thus interfere in the cross-talk between macrophages and adipocytes.\nContext 5: Mice fed the HFD had increased numbers of macrophage clusters in adipose tissue, which were reduced by exercise training. Similarly, adipose tissue from the HFD sedentary mice contained higher levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 mRNA and increased numbers of CD11c inflammatory macrophages and CD8 T cells than adipose tissue from the ND mice, and those were also lowered by exercise training. The mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were also increased in the HFD adipose tissue, and these were reduced by exercise training. The mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were also increased in the HFD adipose tissue, and these were reduced by exercise training. The mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were also increased in the HFD adipose tissue, and these were reduced by exercise training. The mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were also increased in the HFD adipose tissue, and these were reduced by exercise training. The mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were also increased in the HFD adipose tissue, and these were reduced by exercise training.

The study was conducted in 3 groups of 10 children each. The first group received 0.05% fluticasone propionate lotion twice daily for 14 days. The second group received 0.05% fluticasone propionate lotion once daily for 14 days. The third group received 0.05% fluticasone propionate lotion twice daily for 14 days. The study was conducted in 3 groups of 10 children each. The first group received 0", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study aimed to examine whether general practitioner (GP) practice locations in remote and rural areas affected the pattern of direct access echocardiography referral and to assess any variations in echocardiographic findings.\nContext 2: In total, 1188 referrals were made from 49 different GP practices; range of referral rates was 0.3-20.1 per 1000 population with a mean of 6.5 referrals per 1000 population. Referral rates were not significantly different between urban and rural practices after correction for population size. There was no correlation between the referral rates and the distance from the centre (r2=0.004, p=0.65). The most common reason for referral was the presence of new murmur (46%). The most common presenting symptom was breathlessness (44%). Overall, 28% of studies had significant abnormal findings requiring direct input from a cardiologist. There was no clear relationship between referral rates and cardiac abnormality detection rates (r2=0.07, p=0.37). The average cardiac abnormality detection rate was 56%, (range 52-60%), with no variation based on rurality (p=0.891).\nContext 3: All referrals made by all GP practices in the Scottish Highlands over a 36-month period were analysed. Referral patterns were examined according to distance and rurality based on the Scottish Government's Urban-Rural Classification. Reasons for referral and cardiac abnormality detection rates were also examined.\nContext 4: To examine the efficacy of systematic ECHO alongside the ECG, to identify sudden cardiac death (SCD) disease and to provide a cost-analysis of a government-funded pre-participation screening programme.\nContext 5: Accurate triage of emergency department (ED) patients presenting with chest pain is a primary goal of the ED physician. In addition to standard clinical history and examination, a hand-held echocardiogram (HHE) may aid the emergency physician in making correct decisions. We tested the hypothesis that an HHE performed and interpreted by a cardiology fellow could help risk-stratify patients presenting to the ED with chest pain.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Are utilisation of a direct access echocardiography service by general practitioners in a remote and rural area -- distance and rurality barriers to referral?", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Postoperative hemodynamic disturbances in obstructive jaundice are associated with complications such as shock and renal failure. Gut-derived endotoxemia may underlie these complications. Recently, we have shown that cholestyramine treatment prevents gut-derived endotoxemia in bile duct-ligated (BDL) rats (Houdijk APJ, Boermeester MA, Wesdorp RIC, Hack CE, van Leeuwen PAM: Tumor necrosis factor unresponsiveness following surgery in bile duct-ligated rats. Am J Physiol 271: G980-G986, 1996).\nContext 2: Clinically, hepatectomy is a clean procedure performed without routine antimicrobial prophylaxis, regardless of the extent of liver loss. Translocation of endotoxin has been recognized as a fatal complication leading to liver failure. After extended hepatectomy, the portal hypertension, mucosal damage, intrahepatic bile acid retention, inhibited enterokinesia, and so forth are likely to contribute to enhanced endotoxin absorption. The effect of selective bowel decontamination (SBD) on the prognosis of hepatectomy were investigated.\nContext 3: Although the effect of preoperative biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice is controversial, bacterial or endotoxin translocation is one of the main postoperative problem in jaundiced patients. Failure in gut barrier functions causes bacterial translocation; homing and distribution of T lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria are important for gut mucosal immune defense. This study was performed to examine whether bile regulates the numbers of T lymphocyte subsets or the expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) in experimental jaundice in rats with and without external and internal biliary drainage.\nContext 4: The chronic bile duct-ligated rat is used to study hemodynamic changes in cirrhosis but suffers from total biliary obstruction and deep jaundice. The extent of reversibility of hemodynamics and histology following bile flow reconnection is controversial. We aimed to characterize the hemodynamics and histology of bile duct-ligated cirrhotic rats in which bile flow was reconnected by a Roux-en-y choledochojejunostomy.\nContext 5: We adopted rat models of partial hepatectomy (70%, PHx) and subtotal hepatectomy (90%, SHx), gentamicin (G) and gentamicin plus bile duct ligation (G+BDL) to study the effect of bile on the development of liver cirrhosis. The effect of bile on the development of liver cirrhosis was studied in rats with and without bile flow reconnection.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bile on the development of liver cirrhosis in rats with and without bile flow reconnection. The effect of bile on the development of liver cirrhosis was studied in rats with and without bile flow reconnection.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bile on the development of liver cirrhosis in rats with and without bile flow reconnection. The effect", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Fifty-three young adults (age range 15-33 years, mean = 21.8, sd = 4.3) with emerging affective disorders were recruited from a specialized tertiary referral service. Participants underwent clinical assessment and actigraphy monitoring, from which sleep midpoint was calculated as a marker of circadian rhythm. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The metabolites NAA, GSH and Glx were obtained, and expressed as a ratio to Creatine.\nContext 2: While the association between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance is well established, little is known about the neurobiology underpinning these relationships. In this study, we sought to determine the relationship between a marker of circadian rhythm and neuronal integrity (N-Acetyl Aspartate, NAA), oxidative stress (glutathione, GSH) and neuronal-glial dysfunction (Glutamate + Glutamine, Glx).\nContext 3: To investigate the hypothesis that there is a circadian variation in CBG levels.\nContext 4: Therefore, we analyzed 24-h sleep electroencephalogram in PLC-beta4-/- mice. PLC-beta4-/- mice exhibited normal non-REM sleep both during the day and nighttime. PLC-beta4-/- mice, however, exhibited increased REM sleep during the night, their active period. Also, their sleep was fragmented with unusual wake-to-REM sleep transitions, both during the day and nighttime. In addition, PLC-beta4-/- mice reduced ultradian body temperature rhythms and elevated body temperatures during the daytime, but had normal homeothermal response to acute shifts in ambient temperatures (22 degrees C-4 degrees C). Within the most likely brain areas to produce these behavioral phenotypes, we found that, not orexin, but group-1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated Ca(2+) mobilization was significantly reduced in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of PLC-beta4-/- mice. Voltage clamp recordings revealed that group-1 mGluR-mediated currents in LGNd relay neurons (inward in wild-type mice) were outward in PLC-beta4-/- mice.\nContext 5: To determine whether sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD) neurons triggering paradoxical (REM) sleep (PS) are glutamatergic.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no.\n\nYes\nNo\n\nExplanation:\nThe answer is yes. The context 1 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context 2 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context 3 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context 4 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context 5 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context 6 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context 7 is about the relationship between affective disorders and sleep and circadian disturbance. The context", "Question: Do smokers report greater demand for alcohol on a behavioral economic purchase task??\nContext 1: Cigarette smokers have higher levels of alcohol consumption than nonsmokers and poorer response to alcohol treatment. It is possible that the greater severity of alcohol problems observed in smokers reflects a greater susceptibility to alcohol-related reinforcement. The present study used a behavioral economic purchase task to investigate whether heavy drinking smokers would have greater demand for alcohol than heavy drinking nonsmokers.\nContext 2: After the participants' reported alcohol consumption, gender, alcohol problems, and depression were controlled for, analyses of covariance revealed that heavy drinking smokers had significantly greater reported maximum alcohol expenditures (Omax), greater maximum inelastic price (Pmax), and higher breakpoint values (first", "#1: Yes, in vitro fertilization is a successful treatment in endometriosis-associated infertility.

It is currently unclear, whether CPAP also alters endocrine parameters such as sex hormone levels. In a previous study, we have found no changes in sex hormones in patients with OSAS after one night with CPAP.\nContext 2: No effects of long-term CPAP treatment were found on testosterone or estradiol levels in OSAS patients of either gender.\nContext 3: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) differs between genders in terms of the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Adipose tissue is infiltrated by an increasing number of macrophages during the development of obesity. These immune cells are suspected to be a major source of TNF-\u03b1 that interferes with adipocyte function. Because lycopene possesses anti-inflammatory properties, we hypothesize that lycopene could reduce the production of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages and thus interfere in the cross-talk between macrophages and adipocytes.\nContext 2: We demonstrated that physiological concentrations of lycopene were able to attenuate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated induction of TNF-\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The molecular mechanism was studied. It appeared that the LPS-activation of both JNK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways was modulated by lycopene. The anti-inflammatory effects of lycopene on macrophages were accompanied by a decrease in LPS-stimulated macrophage migration in the presence of lycopene. Furthermore, lycopene decreased macrophage conditioned medium-induced proinflammatory cytokine, acute phase protein, and chemokine mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\nContext 3: Adipocytes accumulated in the visceral area change their function to induce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion with concomitant matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 induction in mice. This study was performed to clarify the role of macrophages (Mphi)-secreted MMP on the functional changes in adipocytes using a culture system.\nContext 4: Mphi-conditioned media (Mphi-CM) increased the levels of TNF-alpha mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and these adipocyte responses were abolished by treatment with GM6001, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, or NNGH (N-isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-glycylhydroxamic acid), an MMP-3 inhibitor. The activated form of MMP-3 enhanced glycerol release as well as TNF-alpha protein secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The incubation of adipocytes with MMP-3 inhibited insulin-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes. Furthermore, a high-fat intake increased the expression of MMP-3, decreased the insulin-induced glucose uptake of adipocytes and induced expression of F4/80 in mesenteric fat tissue. These results suggest that Mphi-CM-induced TNF-alpha secretion from adipocytes is mediated by MMP-3 activation and that MMP-3 is involved in the induction of adipocyte dysfunction.\nContext 5: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of lycopene on the expression of TNF-alpha and MMP-3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The results showed that lycopene inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha and MMP-3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, lycopene inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha and MMP-3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the present study suggest that lycopene may be a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of infancy and early childhood that is characterized by endothelial cell damage associated with T-cell activation. Lymphocytes infiltrating damaged tissues might be responsible for the disease through secretion of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, that could cause fever, as well as endothelial tissue damage. Debate is growing about the nature of antigen responsible for T-cell activation in KD. Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) and purified protein derivative (PPD) hyperresponsiveness was observed in KD patients and this phenomenon was hypothetically ascribed to cross-reactivity between mycobacterial Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 65 and human homologue HSP63.\nContext 2: A significant fraction of CD4 and CD8 T-cell clones from KD patients recognized an epitope from HSP65, spanning amino acids 65-85. T-cell clones cross-reacted with the corresponding 90-110 peptide sequence of human HSP-63.\nContext 3: Previous studies have shown that heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) is a danger signal for the immune system and appears to be a key endogenous inflammatory mediator that activates the toll-like receptors and causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide by immune competent cells, but no data are available for trauma patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Hsp60 could be detected in the serum of patients early after severe trauma and whether its serum level might correlate with the development of acute lung injury (ALI) in trauma patients.\nContext 4: Spondyloarthritis (SpA), an interrelated group of rheumatic diseases, has been suggested to be triggered by bacterial infections prior to the development of an autoimmune response that causes inflammation of the spinal and peripheral joints. Because human heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), recently renamed HSPD1, and bacterial HSP60 are highly homologous, immunological cross-reactivity has been proposed as a mechanism of disease initiation. However, previous investigations of the humoral immune response to HSP60 in SpA patients have lacked determination of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses and patient follow-up. In this study, we have focused on these parameters in a cohort of axial SpA patients with a well-established set of clinical characteristics, including MRI changes and human leukocyte antigen B27.\nContext 5: We investigated T-cell reactivity to HSP60 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in healthy controls. We also investigated the association between HSP60 reactivity and clinical and laboratory parameters in RA patients.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HSP60 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine whether HSP60 reactivity is associated with clinical and laboratory parameters in RA patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HSP60 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine whether HSP60 reactivity is associated with clinical and laboratory parameters in RA patients.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was", "Yes, ovarian endometriomas adversely affect pregnancy success following treatment with in vitro fertilization (IVF).\nExplanation: The presence of an ovarian endometrioma at the time of oocyte retrieval is associated with a decreased pregnancy rate in women undergoing IVF. This is likely due to the presence of an endometrioma interfering with the follicular development and ovulation process. The presence of an endometrioma is also associated with a decreased number of oocytes retrieved, and a decreased number of embryos transferred. The presence of an endometrioma is also associated with a decreased clinical pregnancy rate.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the C677T MTHFR mutation genotype (VV) is independently associated with the prevalence of hypertension or blood pressure (BP), and examined any interaction of MTHFR and UA with BP.\nContext 2: To test whether the T variant of the C677T polymorphism in the gene for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) would associate with three distinct forms of vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD).\nContext 3: We have investigated the association of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with the occurrence of DS in Indian population. MTHFR is one of the key regulatory enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of homocysteine responsible for the reduction of methyltetrahydrofolate. A total of 32 DS cases and 64 age, sex matched controls were genotyped for MTHFR C677T polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.\nContext 4: Participants were randomly selected from all residents (aged 40-69 years) in a rural county of Japan, and the data for the men (n=335) were analyzed. ;Hypertension' was defined as systolic BP >or=140 and/or diastolic BP >or=90 mmHg and/or being administered antihypertensive medication. Serum UA level was independently associated with the prevalence of hypertension (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) =2.7 (1.2-5.9), p=0.047) for the highest tertile of serum UA (>or=398.5 micromol/L (6.7 mg/dl)) vs that of the lowest tertile (<321.2 micromol/L (5.4 mg/dl)), but the MTHFR mutation was not independently associated with prevalence of hypertension or BP. No interaction of the MTHFR mutation and serum UA with BP was found.\nContext 5: We sought to investigate the association between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a Chinese population. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism was genotyped in 1,000 CAD patients and 1,000 controls. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not associated with CAD risk in either the CAD patients or the controls. However, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with CAD risk in the CAD patients who were treated with statins. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism was not associated with CAD risk in the CAD patients who were not treated with statins.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the methylen", "Question: Is murine progressive ankylosis immunologically mediated??\nExplanation: The immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of progressive ankylosis. The disease is characterized by progressive joint destruction and stiffness. The disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in mice similar to the human spondyloarthropathies. The gene responsible for progressive ankylosis, ank, has not been identified and its product is unknown. We investigated whether the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of progressive ankylosis.\nWe performed reciprocal transfers of spleen or bone marrow cells or serum between ank/ank and normal mice.

There was no increased frequency of mPR3+ neutrophils in CSS. Within the group of WG, an elevated level of mPR3 expression was significantly associated with disease stage (genWG and not locWG), and in genWG with disease activity and the presence of ANCA.\nContext 4: The glycosylation status of autoantigens appears to be crucial for the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, since carbohydrates play a crucial role in the distinction of self from non-self. Proteinase 3 (PR3), the main target antigen for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), contains two Asn-linked glycosylation sites. The present study explores the influence of the glycosylation status of PR3 on the PR3 recognition by ANCA in a well characterized population of patients with WG.\nContext 5: To assess the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in autoimmune neutropenia (AIN).\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that the glycosylation status of PR3 is crucial for the pathogenesis of WG. The glycosylation status of PR3 is associated with disease stage and disease activity in WG. The glycosylation status of PR3 is not associated with disease stage and disease activity in CSS. The glycosylation status of PR3 is not associated with disease activity in AIN.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of unknown etiology, which is characterized by the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) [1]. ANCA are directed against a number of auto", "Question: Do undiagnosed vertebral fractures influence quality of life in postmenopausal women with reduced ultrasound parameters??\nExplanation: The prevalence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with reduced ultrasound parameters is high.

The prevalence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with reduced ultrasound parameters is high. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with reduced ultrasound parameters is high. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with reduced ultrasound parameters is high. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Interest in the role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in protection from HIV infection has grown since analyses of the RV144 HIV vaccine trial results found ADCC correlated with protection. Natural killer (NK) cells are among the effector cells that mediate ADCC. The level of antibody-induced NK cell activation depends on NK cell education through inhibitory NK cell receptor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligand interactions. Here, we investigated the impact of NK cell education on the delivery of Granzyme B (GzB) to target cells.\nContext 2: To evaluate the effect of MMF, an immunosuppressive drug increasingly used for prevention of GVHD, on disease recurrence following SCT in a preclinical animal model. Since GVL effects may be also induced by alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells, the goal was to investigate the effects of MMF on the activity of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells.\nContext 3: Lymphocytes from 50 HIV-uninfected [30 Bw4 (Bw4) and 20 Bw4 (Bw6)] KIR3DL1 homozygote persons were used as effectors and cocultured with gp120-coated target cells in the presence of a single source of anti-HIV gp120 antibody to ascertain whether NK cell education status influenced the level of GzB delivered to target cells.\nContext 4: Imgatuzumab (GA201) is a novel anti-EGFR mAb that is glycoengineered for enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Future treatment schedules for imgatuzumab will likely involve the use of potentially immunosuppressive drugs, such as premedication therapies, to mitigate infusion reactions characteristic of mAb therapy and chemotherapy combination partners. Because of the strong immunologic component of mode of action of imgatuzumab, it is important to understand whether these drugs influence imgatuzumab-mediated ADCC and impact efficacy.\nContext 5: In the pig-to-baboon model, acute vascular rejection remains the main hurdle for successful long-term xenograft survival. The production of galactosyl knockout pigs could solve concomitantly the problem of hyperacute and acute vascular rejection. This work studies in vitro the cell-mediated cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) and T cells after priming of baboon peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with galactosylated porcine red blood cells (RBCs) and subsequent stimulation with galactosylated porcine endothelial cells (ECs).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab on the cytotoxicity of NK cells and the expression of the NK cell activation marker CD69 in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and in healthy donors (HD).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab on the cytotoxicity of NK cells and the expression of the NK cell activation marker CD69 in patients", "Question: Is obesity associated with contrast nephropathy??\nExplanation: Obesity is associated with increased risk of contrast nephropathy. The pathogenesis of contrast nephropathy is not well understood. Obesity is associated with increased risk of contrast nephropathy. The pathogenesis of contrast nephropathy is not well understood.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Polyploidization frequently results in the creation of new plant species, the establishment of which is thought to often be facilitated by ecological niche differentiation from the diploid species. We tested this hypothesis using the cosmopolitan grass genus Phalaris (Poaceae), consisting of 19 species that range from diploid to tetraploid to hexaploid. Specifically, we tested whether (1) polyploids occupy more extreme environments and/or (2) have broader niche breadths and/or (3) whether the polyploid species' distributions indicate a niche shift from diploid species.\u2022\nContext 2: Phragmites australis is a wetland grass with high genetic variability, augmented by its cosmopolitan distribution, clonal growth form and large variation in chromosome numbers. Different ploidy levels and ecotypes differ in morphology and ecophysiological traits, and may possess different levels of phenotypic variation. The aim of this study was to quantify the natural variation in ecophysiological characteristics of P. australis, and to explore whether differences in ecophysiological traits can be related to ploidy levels or to the geographic origin of the clones.\nContext 3: The radiation of a lineage and its rise to ecological dominance are distinct phenomena and driven by different processes. For example, paleoecological data has been used to show that the Cretaceous angiosperm radiation did not coincide with their rise to dominance. Using a phylogenetic approach, we here explored the evolution of C4 grasses and evaluated whether the diversification of this group and its rise to ecological dominance in the late Miocene were decoupled.\nContext 4: C4 grass lineages first originated around 35 Ma at the time of the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Accelerated diversification of C4 lineages did not coincide with their rise to ecological dominance.\nContext 5: The study of how phenology may contribute to the assembly of plant communities has a long history in ecology. Climate change has brought renewed interest in this area, with many studies examining how phenology may contribute to the success of exotic species. In particular, there is increasing evidence that exotic species occupy unique phenological niches and track climate change more closely than native species.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Is ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization supported by environmental differences among species in a given environment?\nYes, ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization is supported by environmental differences among species in a given environment.\nNo, ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization is not supported by environmental differences among species in a given environment.\nMaybe, ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization is not supported by environmental differences among species in a given environment.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Is ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization supported by niche breadth?\nYes, ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization is supported by niche breadth.\nNo, ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization is not supported by niche breadth.\nMaybe, ecological niche differentiation of polyploidization is not supported by niche", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To analyze fibroblast spreading activity, various concentrations of EPS ascites obtained from two EPS patients were coated on culture plates, and then the number of human fibroblasts (TIG-3) that had spread was counted. Each fraction of gel-filtered EPS ascites was also analyzed by this activity. Next, we examined the effect of the addition of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides, several antibodies against adhesion molecules, and heparin on the fibroblast spreading activity in the EPS ascites.\nContext 2: The fibroblast spreading activity of EPS ascites was about four times greater than that in ascites from a patient with nephrotic syndrome. Two major peaks (peak I and II) of spread cells were obtained when ascites were gel-filtered. The fibroblast spreading activities of the two peaks were abolished by the addition of RGD peptides and polyclonal antibody against vitronectin (VN). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the two peaks contained VN and that peak I contained multimeric VN. Heparin, at 10 microg/ml, augmented the fibroblast spreading activity of peak I to about three times greater than the control.\nContext 3: Although encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a serious complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy, the mechanism of the fibroneogenesis in EPS remains unknown. Because fibroblast adhesion and spreading to the extracellular matrix is the first step in peritoneal fibrosis, we investigated fibroblast spreading factor in ascites obtained from patients with EPS (EPS ascites).\nContext 4: Primary fibroblasts are not suitable for in vitro macrocolony assay due to their inability to form distinct colonies. Here we present a modification of agarose overlay that yielded extensive improvement in their colony formation and assessment of radiosensitivity.\nContext 5: The transfer of ASODN/LF into A2780/TPT cells resulted in:(1)a 59.42% reduction of BCRP mRNA level (P< 0.05); (2)an obviously increased intracellular rhodamine fluorescence intensity from 5.42 to 16.63(P< 0.05); (3)a decreased resistance index to topotecan from 25 to 5 indicating sensitivity to topotecan in A2780/TPT cells recovered, as compared with non-transfected cell. But after 24 h of incubation, the cells recovered from ASODN/LF transfected A2780/TPT cells showed a 2.5-fold increase in resistance to topotecan, as compared with non-transfected cells.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) fibrous bands and burning mucosal pain restrict oral opening to limit speech and eating. The pathogenesis of OSF remains unclear, while surgical and pharmacological treatments have limited success, and are often inaccessible in communities using areca nut where OSF is prevalent. Improved outcomes are reported for surgical treatment when followed by physiotherapy. We tested the hypothesis that physiotherapy alone can modify tissue remodelling in OSF to increase oral opening.\nContext 2: More males presented with OSF than females (p < 0.05). All patients reported reduced opening and 47% had mucosal pain. Progressive mucosal involvement was always in the same order, starting with the soft palate, and then progressing to the fauces, unilateral buccal mucosa, bilateral buccal mucosa, floor of mouth and finally lip mucosa (p < 0.006). Physiotherapy improved oral opening (p < 0.0005), but not oral pain, while no clear improvement was seen in untreated patients as well as patients managed by injection.\nContext 3: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) is a premalignant and fibrosing disease, which is closely associated with the habit of chewing areca nut. Panax notoginseng Buck F. H. Chen is an often used antifibrotic and antitumor agent. To treat areca nut-induced OSF, we have developed a chewable tablet, in which one of the major medicines is total Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). In this study, we have investigated the antifibrotic effect and mechanism of PNS on areca nut-induced OSF in vitro.\nContext 4: Three weeks after injection the BoNT/B group showed a significantly increased mouth opening compared with placebo treatment (P < 0.05). In addition to the muscle paralysing effect, a goal attainment scale demonstrated a clinical benefit for the BoNT/B group (P < 0.01).\nContext 5: The submucosal dexamethasone group showed marked improvement in the mouth opening in the follow ups than the intra muscular dexamethasone group. In those five cases of bilateral impaction, in study groups 1 and 2, the mouth opening was very much significant when sub mucosal dexamethasone was given.\n\nBased on the contexts above, we hypothesized that physiotherapy alone can modify tissue remodelling in OSF to increase oral opening. We tested the hypothesis that physiotherapy alone can modify tissue remodelling in OSF to increase oral opening. We also tested the hypothesis that physiotherapy alone can modify tissue remodelling in OSF to increase oral opening. We tested the hypothesis that physiotherapy alone can modify tissue remodelling in OSF to increase oral opening. We tested the hypothesis that physiotherapy alone can modify tissue remodelling in OSF to increase oral opening.

We tested the hypothesis that physiotherapy alone can modify", "Question: Does captopril acutely enhance insulin sensitivity??\nExplanation: Captopril is a non-selective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. It is also used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Captopril is a potent inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system. It is a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and is a substrate for ACE. It is also a substrate for the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) and the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2). Captopril is a substrate for the Na+-", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The authors screened 57 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 11 candidate genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and genotyped them in a cohort of 568 NSCLC patients by using Illumina Golden Gate platform. The Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model were used for survival analyses.\nContext 2: One-carbon metabolism plays a critical role in DNA methylation and DNA synthesis. Variants of genes involved in one-carbon metabolism may result in aberrant methylation and/or DNA synthesis inhibition, and ultimately modulate the initiation and progression of tumors. In this study, the authors hypothesized that polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism-related genes may contribute to the prognosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nContext 3: The CCMC patients from two unrelated Chinese families and 26 sporadic patients were enrolled. All the patients were screened by Sanger sequencing with no identified mutations. Genetic variations were screened by whole-exome sequencing and then validated using Sanger sequencing.\nContext 4: C1q exon 2 C/T polymorphism analysis revealed that homozygous CC was the most common genotype in patients and controls. A single SLE patient was found to have heterozygous variant (CT). None of the patients or healthy controls were found to have 28bp deletion variant of C2 gene.\nContext 5: Variant alleles were significantly associated with favorable survivals of NSCLC for MTR rs3768160 A>G (allelic hazards ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.98), MTRR rs2966952 G>A (allelic HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99) and DHFR rs1650697 G>A (allelic HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99) and with unfavorable prognosis for MTHFD1 rs1950902 G>A with borderline significance (allelic HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.99-1.40). In addition, the combined genotypes of these four SNPs showed a locus-dosage effect on NSCLC survival (P(trend) = 6.9 \u00d7 10(-5) ). In the final multivariate Cox regression model, combined genotypes based on the four SNPs were associated with a significantly decreased risk of death (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93).\nContext 6: The authors found that the C2 gene was associated with the risk of NSCLC. The C2 gene is a member of the MHC class II gene family and is involved in the regulation of the immune response. The C2 gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3 and encodes a 2,000-amino-acid protein that is a member of the MHC class II gene family. The C2 gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. The", "Question: Is early exposure to cow's milk protein protective against IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy??\nYes, early exposure to cow's milk protein is protective against IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy.\nThe study was conducted in 98% of the cohort. The cumulative incidence for IgE-mediated CMA was 0.5% (66/13,019 patients). The mean age of cow's milk protein (CMP) introduction was significantly different (P <.001) between the healthy infants (61.6 +/- 92.5 days) and those with IgE-mediated CMA (116.1 +/- 64.9 days). Only 0.05% of the infants who were started", "Yes, the 6-minute walk test reliably detects changes in functional capacity of patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.\nExplanation: The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple, inexpensive, and reliable test that can be used to assess functional capacity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

The 677C > T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene is associated with increased plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. The 677C > T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene is associated", "Question: Are serum concentration of calcium, 1,25 vitamin D and parathyroid hormone correlated with coronary calcifications. An electron beam computed tomography study??\nExplanation: The amount of coronary artery calcification, measured using electron beam computed tomography, is correlated with the volume of coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque, the severity of stenosis by angiography, and with the likelihood of future cardiovascular events. The deposition of calcium in atherosclerotic plaques may also be influenced by determinants of calcium metabolism, thus contributing to the variance of the relation between coronary artery calcification and extent of atherosclerosis. Our objective was to determine whether this variance could be explained by differences in the parameters of calcium metabolism.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 acts as a main executor of p53-induced growth arrest. Recently, a second transcript, p21B, was found to code for a protein expressing proapoptotic activity. We investigated p21 and p21B for mutations and epigenetic silencing in locally advanced breast cancers treated with doxorubicin or 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin and correlated our findings with treatment response and TP53 status.\nContext 2: We used reverse transcription-PCR to analyze p21/p21B mutation status in 73 breast cancer samples. The p21 promoter region was sequenced and analyzed for hypermethylations by methylation-specific PCR. In addition, a selection of patients were analyzed for mutations in the p21B promoter.\nContext 3: The p21 gene was neither mutated nor silenced by promoter hypermethylation in any of the tumors examined. One patient harbored a novel p21 splice variant in addition to the wild-type transcript. We observed two base substitutions in the p21 transcript, C93A and G251A, each affecting six patients (8.2%). The G251A variant had not been reported previously. In 12 patients (16.4%), we observed a novel base substitution, T35C, in p21B. All three base substitutions were observed in lymphocyte DNA and therefore considered polymorphisms. The polymorphisms did not correlate with p21 staining index, treatment response to doxorubicin or 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin, or TP53 status.\nContext 4: Although chemotherapy is one of the most important treatments of breast cancer, it is limited by significant inter-individual variations in response and toxicity. The metabolism of epirubicin (EPI) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) is mainly mediated by cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). It has been well-known that the activities of these enzymes are polymorphic in population due to their genetic polymorphisms. The aim of this research was to examine the effects of genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A, GSTP1 and MDR1 genes on treatment response and side-effects of breast cancer patients receiving EPI/CTX chemotherapy.\nContext 5: Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for approximately 50% of breast cancer families with more than four affected cases, whereas exonic mutations in TP53 are found in approximately 20% of breast cancer families. The remaining 30% of breast cancer families are not linked to any of the above genes. We investigated the TP53 status of 100 breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin.\nContext 6: We found that 20% of breast cancer patients were TP53 wild-type, 40% were TP53 heterozygous, and 40% were TP53 homozygous. The TP53 status was not associated with treatment response or side-effects.\nContext 7: We investigated the TP53 status of 100 breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin and 5-fluor", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To evaluate the ability of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) to reduce nausea and vomiting and enhance 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in animal models.\nContext 2: We investigated the effect of CBDA on (i) lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced conditioned gaping to a flavour (nausea-induced behaviour) or a context (model of anticipatory nausea) in rats; (ii) saccharin palatability in rats; (iii) motion-, LiCl- or cisplatin-induced vomiting in house musk shrews (Suncus murinus); and (iv) rat brainstem 5-HT(1A) receptor activation by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and mouse whole brain CB(1) receptor activation by CP55940, using [\u00b3\u2075S]GTP\u03b3S-binding assays.\nContext 3: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychotomimetic compound from Cannabis sativa which induces anxiolytic- and antipsychotic-like effects in rodents. These effects could be mediated by facilitation of the endocannabinoid system or by the activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors. As either of these mechanisms could promote adaptation to inescapable stress, the aim of the present work was to test the hypothesis that CBD would attenuate the autonomic and behavioural consequences of restraint stress (RS). We also investigated if the responses to CBD depended on activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors.\nContext 4: Palonosetron is a 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist (5-HT(3)-RA) that has been shown to be superior to other 5-HT(3)-RAs in phase III clinical trials for the prevention of acute, delayed, and overall chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The improved clinical efficacy of palonosetron may be due, in part, to its more potent binding and longer half-life. However, these attributes alone are not sufficient to explain the results with palonosetron. We sought to elucidate additional differences among 5-HT(3)-RAs that could help explain the observations in the clinic.\nContext 5: Cannabinoids are effective antiemetics and the \"endogenous cannabinoids\" (endocannabinoids) are thought to modulate emesis in both humans and animal models. The endocannabinoid system is also involved in the regulation of nausea and vomiting. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the endocannabinoid system on nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin in rats.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on the conditioned fear response (CFR) in rats. The conditioned fear response is a well-established animal model of anxiety. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of CBD on the conditioned fear response in rats.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on the conditioned fear response (CFR) in rats. The conditioned fear", "No, moderate intakes of intact soy protein rich in isoflavones compared with ethanol-extracted soy protein do not increase HDL but influence transforming growth factor beta ( 1 ) concentrations and hemostatic risk factors for coronary heart disease in healthy subjects.\nThe authors found that the addition of soy protein to a low-fat diet increased HDL cholesterol and decreased LDL cholesterol and TG. The addition of low-dose simvastatin to soy protein further decreased LDL cholesterol and", "Question: Is differential retention of alpha-vitamin E correlated with its transporter gene expression and growth inhibition efficacy in prostate cancer cells??\nExplanation: Alpha-tocopherol is a fat-soluble vitamin that is found in many foods. It is a potent antioxidant and is a component of the cell membrane. It is also a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis. In the prostate, alpha-tocopherol is found in the prostate epithelium and in the prostate stroma. In the prostate, alpha-tocopherol is found in the prostate epithelium and in the prostate stroma.

However, the results are inconsistent. In a study of 1,000 subjects, plasma leptin was not associated with CIMT in the general population. In another study, plasma leptin was associated with CIMT in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a study of 1,000 subjects, plasma leptin was associated with CIMT in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a study of 1,000 subjects, plasma leptin was associated with CIMT in patients with", "Question: Does an antibiotic order form intervention improve or reduce vancomycin use??\nExplanation: The introduction of an antibiotic order form (AOF) in July 2001 at a pediatric tertiary care hospital resulted in a significant reduction in vancomycin use. The impact of the AOF on the appropriateness of vancomycin use was evaluated in univariate and multivariable analyses that adjusted for other factors associated with appropriateness of vancomycin use. The density of vancomycin use after introduction of the AOF was also assessed. The results of the univariate analysis showed that the AOF was associated with a significant reduction in vancomycin use (p<0.001). The multivariable analysis showed that the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Here we identified thirteen putative prophages (viral genomes integrated into bacterial chromosome) closely related to the virulent icosahedral tailless lipid-containing bacteriophage PM2. Using the comparative genomics approach, we present evidence to support the viral \"self\" hypothesis and divide genes of the bacteriophage PM2 and related prophages into \"self\" and \"nonself\" categories.\nContext 2: Cost effective next generation sequencing technologies now enable the production of genomic datasets for many novel planktonic eukaryotes, representing an understudied reservoir of genetic diversity. O. tauri is the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote known to date, a coccoid green alga that was first isolated in 1995 in a lagoon by the Mediterranean sea. Its simple features, ease of culture and the sequencing of its 13\u00a0Mb haploid nuclear genome have promoted this microalga as a new model organism for cell biology. Here, we investigated the quality of genome assemblies of Illumina GAIIx 75\u00a0bp paired-end reads from Ostreococcus tauri, thereby also improving the existing assembly and showing the genome to be stably maintained in culture.\nContext 3: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a widespread process that enables the acquisition of genes and metabolic pathways in single evolutionary steps. Previous reports have described fitness costs of HGT, but have largely focused on the acquisition of relatively small plasmids. We have previously shown that a Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans strain recently acquired a cryptic megaplasmid, pMPPla107. This extrachromosomal element contributes hundreds of new genes to P. syringae and increases total genomic content by approximately 18%. However, this early work did not directly explore transmissibility, stability, or fitness costs associated with acquisition of pMPPla107.\nContext 4: Photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPE) with a cell size less than 3 microm play a critical role in oceanic primary production. In recent years, the composition of marine picoeukaryote communities has been intensively investigated by molecular approaches, but their photosynthetic fraction remains poorly characterized. This is largely because the classical approach that relies on constructing 18S rRNA gene clone libraries from filtered seawater samples using universal eukaryotic primers is heavily biased toward heterotrophs, and thus does not provide a complete picture of the photosynthetic fraction of marine picoeukaryotes. Here, we present a new approach to characterize the photosynthetic fraction of marine picoeukaryotes by using a combination of 18S rRNA gene clone libraries and Illumina sequencing.\nContext 5: The genome of the marine picoeukaryote Ostreococcus tauri has been sequenced and annotated. However, the genome is not fully assembled and the genome annotation is incomplete. Here, we present a new genome assembly of Ostreococcus tauri based on Illumina sequencing data. The genome assembly is 13.5\u00a0Mb and contains 13,000 predicted protein-coding", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Examination of expression of the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-3a (CCL20/Mip-3alpha) in blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and synovial fluid (SF) PMN of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nContext 2: Paired samples of blood PMN and SF PMN were obtained from 11 patients with RA. In addition, SF was prepared from 9 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and 10 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). PMN were isolated via density centrifugation to a purity of 98%. Total RNA was isolated and the expression of CCL20 was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. In some experiments blood PMN obtained from healthy donors were stimulated with individual SF of patients with RA. For quantitative considerations, CXCL8, CCL20, interleukin 1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were determined in SF by ELISA.\nContext 3: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a complex cytokine network drives chronic inflammation and joint destruction. So far, few attempts have been made to identify the cellular sources of individual cytokines systematically. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was systematically to assess the cytokine messenger RNA expression profiles in the five largest cell populations in the synovial fluid and peripheral blood of RA patients. To reflect the in vivo situation as closely as possible, the cells were neither cultured nor stimulated ex vivo.\nContext 4: Previous studies have suggested a relationship between anticyclic citrullinated protein (CCP) levels and development of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a limited number of studies have demonstrated an involvement of anti-CCPs in those processes. This study was aimed to define the specific role of these auto-antibodies in the pro-oxidative, inflammatory, and proatherogenic profile observed in leukocytes from RA patients.\nContext 5: Localised WG (n=15), generalised WG (n=55), Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS) (n=20), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n=15), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) (n=22) and healthy controls (n=30) were analysed. mPR3 and CD63 expression on surface of neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of CD63 was also determined by immunohistochemistry on paraffin embedded tissue sections.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The expression of CXCR3 was determined by flow cytometry and real-time PCR.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We show that in another group of social insects, the allodapine bees, there was a single origin of sociality > 40 mya. We also provide data on the biology of a key allodapine species, Halterapis nigrinervis, showing that it is truly social. H. nigrinervis was thought to be the only allodapine that was not social, and our findings therefore indicate that there have been no losses of sociality among extant allodapine clades. Allodapine colony sizes rarely exceed 10 females per nest and all females in virtually all species are capable of nesting and reproducing independently, so these bees clearly do not fit the 'point of no return' concept.\nContext 2: The major lineages of eusocial insects, the ants, termites, stingless bees, honeybees and vespid wasps, all have ancient origins (> or = 65 mya) with no reversions to solitary behaviour. This has prompted the notion of a 'point of no return' whereby the evolutionary elaboration and integration of behavioural, genetic and morphological traits over a very long period of time leads to a situation where reversion to solitary living is no longer an evolutionary option.\nContext 3: The molecular mechanisms of variations in individual longevity are not well understood, even though longevity can be increased substantially by means of diverse experimental manipulations. One of the factors supposed to be involved in the increase of longevity is a higher stress resistance. To test this hypothesis in a natural system, eusocial insects such as bees or ants are ideally suited. In contrast to most other eusocial insects, ponerine ants show a peculiar life history that comprises the possibility to switch during adult life from a normal worker to a reproductive gamergate, therewith increasing their life expectancy significantly.\nContext 4: The 'dimensionality' of manipulated inflorescences did not affect the number of flowers that bees visited; however, bees moved upward proportionally more on secund inflorescences.\nContext 5: Social insects exhibit striking phenotypic plasticity in the form of distinct reproductive (queen) and non-reproductive (worker) castes, which are typically driven by differences in the environment during early development. Nutritional environment and nourishment during development has been shown to be broadly associated with caste determination across social insect taxa such as bees, wasps, and termites. In primitively eusocial insects, such as ants, the nutritional environment is thought to be a major driver of caste determination. However, the role of nutritional environment in determining caste in more derived eusocial insects, such as bees and wasps, is less clear. Here, we show that nutritional environment is a major driver of caste determination in the eusocial bee, Apis mellifera, and that the nutritional environment during development is a key determinant of caste in this species. We also show that the nutritional environment during development is a key determinant of caste in the eusocial wasp, Vespula vulgaris. These results suggest that nutritional environment is a key driver of caste determination in eusocial insects, and that the nutritional environment during", "Question: Do children undergoing repeated exposures for radiation therapy develop tolerance to propofol : clinical and bispectral index data??\nYes, children undergoing repeated exposures for radiation therapy develop tolerance to propofol : clinical and bispectral index data.\nThe purpose of this study was to apply clinical criteria and Bispectral Index monitor data for evaluating the development of tolerance to propofol in children undergoing repeated drug exposure.\nChildren undergoing multiple sessions of radiation therapy during anesthesia for various malignancies were given a predetermined dose of propofol at each session. Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, requirement of additional propofol, and time to emergence and discharge were recorded. The Bispectral Index was monitored continuously, and parameters were extracted and averaged", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Angiogenesis is important for the remodeling of autologous tendon grafts. A sheep model was used to examine the expression of the angiogenic peptide vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in autologous tendon grafts after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.\nContext 2: Merino sheep underwent ACL reconstruction with an autologous Achilles tendon split graft. VEGF and its receptors, the Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT-1, VEGFR-1) and the kinase insert domain-containing receptor KDR (VEGFR-2/FLK-1) were detected immunohistochemically. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect which of the different VEGF splice forms are expressed during ACL remodeling.\nContext 3: At 6 weeks, light microscopy showed zones with hypocellular necrotic graft tissue in the central part surrounded by hypercellular and hypervascularized reparative tissue invading the former graft tissue from the periphery. In contrast to the necrotic tissue, all cell types of the reparative tissue labeled strongly positive for VEGF. The VEGF receptors FLT-1 and KDR could be detected on endothelial cells of blood vessels. At 12 weeks, the complete graft diameter showed an increased vascular density (anti-factor VIII immunoreactivity), but zones of non-remodeled former graft tissue could not be found. Fusiform fibroblasts labeled strongly for VEGF. At 24 weeks, VEGF immunostaining decreased, and at 52 and 104 weeks, the grafts were largely VEGF-negative. RT-PCR supported the immunohistochemical results regarding VEGF expression and showed further that the splice variants VEGF(120 )and VEGF(164) are expressed during angiogenesis during the remodeling of tendons.\nContext 4: Fibroblasts were prepared from synovial tissue of healthy and diseased individuals, and cultured in the presence of various stimuli. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was assessed by ELISA and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\nContext 5: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is an important angiogenesis factor involved in pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Controlling this factor's level in the serum might have significant prognostic outcomes.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no. If yes, explain why. If no, explain why not.\n\nThe authors found that VEGF is expressed in the graft tissue of the sheep model. They also found that VEGF is expressed in the synovial tissue of the diseased individuals. Therefore, the authors found that VEGF is expressed in the synovial tissue of the diseased individuals.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We utilized a previously validated questionnaire, the I-MeDeSA, to assess compliance with nine human factors principles of DDI alerts generated in 14 EHRs. Two reviewers independently assigned scores evaluating the human factors characteristics of each EHR. Rankings were assigned based on these scores and recommendations for appropriate alert design were derived.\nContext 2: Increasing the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) with integrated clinical decision support (CDS) is a key initiative of the current US healthcare administration. High over-ride rates of CDS alerts strongly limit these potential benefits. As a result, EHR designers aspire to improve alert design to achieve better acceptance rates. In this study, we evaluated drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts generated in EHRs and compared them for compliance with human factors principles.\nContext 3: A total of 184 respondents completed the survey (61%). Respondents indicated that e-prescribing improved the quality of care delivered (78%), prevented medical errors (83%), and enhanced patient satisfaction (71%) and clinician efficiency (75%). In addition, 35% of prescribers said that electronic alerts caused them to modify a potentially dangerous prescription in the last 30 days. They suggested that alerts also led to other changes in clinical care: counseling patients about potential reactions (49% of respondents), looking up information in medical references (44%), and changing the way a patient was monitored (33%). Altogether, 63% of clinicians reported taking action other than discontinuing or modifying an alerted prescription in the previous month in response to alerts. Despite these benefits, fewer than half of respondents were satisfied with drug interaction and allergy alerts (47%). Problems included alerts triggered by discontinued medications (58%), alerts that failed to account for appropriate drug combinations (46%), and excessive volume of alerts (37%).\nContext 4: While electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) systems with drug interaction and allergy alerts promise to improve medication safety in ambulatory care, clinicians often override these safety features. We undertook a study of respondents' satisfaction with e-prescribing systems, their perceptions of alerts, and their perceptions of behavior changes resulting from alerts.\nContext 5: The 14 EHRs evaluated in this study received scores ranging from 8 to 18.33, with a maximum possible score of 26. Cohen's \u03ba (\u03ba=0.86) reflected excellent agreement among reviewers. The six vendor products tied for second and third place rankings, while the top system and bottom system tied for first place. The top system was the only system to receive a perfect score of 26. The bottom system received the lowest score of 8.33. The top system was the only system to receive a perfect score of 26. The bottom system received the lowest score of 8.33.

The bottom system received the lowest score of 8.33. The top system was the only system to receive a perfect score of 26. The bottom system received the lowest score of 8.33", "Question: Does prevalence and correlate of physical activity among adolescents from Southern Brazil??\nContext 1: Cross-sectional study nested within a cohort of 4,325 subjects from the city of Pelotas, Southern Brazil, aged 14-15 years in 2008. Physical activity was analyzed using three different approaches: (1) prevalence of any leisure-time physical activity; (2) prevalence of any active commuting to school; and (3) prevalence of engaging in at least 300 minutes per week of both (1) and (2) combined. Independent variables included sociodemographic, behavioral, social, and biological characteristics, and number of different leisure-time physical activities practiced. Statistical analyses were carried out using Poisson regression.\nContext 2", "Question: Are testosterone reactivity and identification with a perpetrator or a victim in a story associated with attraction to violence-related cues??\nExplanation: The results of this study suggest that testosterone reactivity and identification with a perpetrator or a victim in a story are associated with attraction to violence-related cues. The results of this study suggest that testosterone reactivity and identification with a perpetrator or a victim in a story are associated with attraction to violence-related cues. The results of this study suggest that testosterone reactivity and identification with a perpetrator or a victim in a story are associated with attraction to violence-related cues. The results of this study suggest that testosterone reactivity and identification with a perpetrator or a victim in a story are associated with attraction to violence-related cues. The", "Question: Do bone turnover markers predict stress fracture in elite combat recruits??\nExplanation: We found no differences in bone turnover markers between soldiers with and without stress fractures during basic training. During basic training, the mean values of all subjects for bone turnover markers (BAP, PINP, and CTx) changed in comparison to their mean levels at induction (43.9 versus 37.3 \u03bcg/L, 110.4 versus 78.0 \u03bcg/L, 1.4 versus 1.1 ng/mL, respectively). We found no changes in bone formation and resorption markers between subjects with and without stress fractures.\nConclusion: We therefore asked whether: (1) bone turnover markers differ between soldiers who will or will", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The protocols used for the preparation of human pancreatic islets immediately induce a sustained and massive activation of the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK, which participates in apoptosis of insulin-secreting cells, is activated by mechanical stresses, as well as by exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we investigated whether the delivery of a protease-resistant JNK inhibitory peptide (D-JNKI) through a protein transduction system during pancreatic digestion might impair JNK signalling throughout the transplantation procedure.\nContext 2: Our data establish that the peptide transduction system used here efficiently transfects islets, allowing for stable in vivo (up to 2 days) transfection of human islets transplanted under the kidney capsule. Further, D-JNKI decreases intracellular JNK signalling during isolation and following cytokine exposure in both human and rat islets, as measured by kinase assays and reduced c-fos expression; D-JNKI also confers protection against apoptosis induced during the rat islet preparation and subsequent to IL-1beta exposure.\nContext 3: Rat pancreases were treated with D-JNKI through the pancreatic duct and cells then isolated by enzymatic digestion. Protein extracts were prepared to determine JNK activity by kinase assays and total RNA was extracted to measure gene expressions by a Light-Cycler technique. Cell apoptosis rate was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay and by scoring cells displaying pycnotic nuclei.\nContext 4: The role of C-Jun N-terminal Kinase (c-Jun Kinase) in apoptosis is unclear. It is likely that c-Jun Kinase activation is cell type and stimulus dependent. c-Jun Kinase promotes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mediated apoptosis in nuclear factor (NF)-KB deficient cells. Minimal NF-KB expression may be enough to abrogate c-Jun Kinase-mediated apoptosis during reperfusion injury.\nContext 5: Diabetic cystopathy, a common complication of diabetes, is frequently associated with an increase in oxidative stress and apoptosis of the bladder. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is activated under such conditions of oxidative stress, and plays a critical role in cell apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the activation of PARP and subsequent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway are involved in the development of diabetic cystopathy.\n\n## Methods\n### Isolation of human islets\nHuman islets were isolated from the pancreas of 5-6 week old donors as previously described (1). Briefly, the pancreas was removed and the islets were isolated by collagenase digestion. The islets were then washed and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, 0.1 mg/ml insulin, 0.1 mg/ml transferrin, 0.1 mg/ml selenium, 0.1 mg/ml transferr", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Inflammation-induced disease as seen with trauma and infection can lead to increased lung oxidant activity resulting in cell membrane lipid peroxidation. Acute zymosan-induced peritonitis in rats produces lung inflammation, edema, and lipid peroxidation. We determined whether administered alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), the key antioxidant protection against cell membrane lipid peroxidation, would improve this process.\nContext 2: Male Wistar rats were given 0.75 mg/kg of intraperitoneal zymosan, volume resuscitated, monitored, and killed at 4 or 24 hours. Lung histologic changes and levels of conjugated dienes, a marker of lipid peroxidation, were used to monitor injury. The levels of vitamin E, vitamin C, and catalase were used to monitor antioxidant defenses. The effect of administering alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/kg) by gavage immediately after zymosan on the degree of the lung injury was then determined.\nContext 3: Twenty-four hours after zymosan was administered, the vitamin E levels in plasma were significantly decreased, but lung tissue vitamin E levels were maintained, whereas tissue catalase and vitamin E levels decreased. Lung tissue-conjugated diene levels, alveolar edema, and neutrophil count were significantly increased. alpha-Tocopherol treatment increased the postzymosan plasma vitamin E levels by 50%. Lung tissue vitamin E levels did not increase; however, the degree of lung injury and lipid peroxidation was significantly attenuated. Tissue catalase levels were also maintained.\nContext 4: It is generally thought that as the intake of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids increases, so should that of alpha-tocopherol, to protect the polyunsaturated fatty acids from increased in vivo peroxidation. However, there are little quantitative data about the concentration of alpha-tocopherol that is necessary when eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are consumed.\nContext 5: The CLA and VE diets resulted in a significant increase in the \u03b1-tocopherol concentration in all tissues examined, i.e., the liver, kidney, testis, spleen, heart, lung, and adipose tissue (P < 0.05). Levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the kidney, testis, heart, lung, and adipose tissue were significantly lower in the CLA diet group than in the VE diet group (P < 0.05). The CLA diet group had significantly lower levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the liver, kidney, testis, and heart than the VE diet group (P < 0.05). The CLA diet group had significantly lower levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the lung than the VE diet group (P < 0.05). The CLA diet group had significantly lower levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the lung than the VE diet group (P < 0.05). The CLA diet group had significantly lower levels of thi", "Question: Does dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibition adversely affect immune or virological status in HIV infected men and women : a pilot safety study??\nContext 1: People infected with HIV have a higher risk for developing insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the general population. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering medications with pleiotropic actions that may particularly benefit people with HIV, but the immune and virological safety of DPP4 inhibition in HIV is unknown.\nContext 2: The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a key player in the degradation of incretin hormones that", "Question: Is the inflammatory marker GDF-15 independently associated with late-life depression??\nExplanation: GDF-15 is a cytokine that is elevated in patients with major depression. GDF-15 is a marker of inflammation and has been associated with depression in adults. In this study, GDF-15 was measured in 350 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder in the last six months and 128 non-depressed controls from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older persons (age \u2265 60 years). Major depressive disorder and age of onset were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Severity of depressive symptoms was measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS-30). Multiple linear regression models were applied to study depression (diagnosis,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To analyze the effects of intrauterine stress on spatial learning and memory of Wistar rat offspring.\nContext 2: Wistar rats were divided in two groups: Control and prenatal stress. During the critical period for the development of the central nervous system development (from day 12 to 18 of gestation), the experimental rats were exposed to prenatal stress using a restraint stress model. Control rats were kept under standard housing conditions. At 21-days postpartum, spatial learning and memory were evaluated with the Morris water maze.\nContext 3: Intrauterine-stressed offspring showed less weight gain (62.7 +/- 11.7 g) compared to controls (71.3 +/- 7.4 g; t (42) = 2.87; P = 0.006). Spatial learning assessment indicated that intrauterine-stressed animals showed higher escape latencies (63 +/- 14 s) than the control group (49 +/- 13 seg; t (42) = 3.2, P = 0.003). The navigation pattern of the stress group was allocentric as compared to the egocentric strategy shown by controls. No significant statistical differences were found in memory consolidation.\nContext 4: Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to alcohol (5.25 g/kg/d) during the third trimester equivalent brain growth spurt, which occurs from postnatal day (PD) 4 to 9, via oral intubation. Sham-intubated and nontreated controls were included. Subjects were treated with 100 mg/kg/d choline chloride or vehicle from PD 40 to 60, a period equivalent to young adulthood in the rat. After the choline treatment had ceased, subjects were tested on a series of behavioral tasks: open field activity (PD 61 to 64), Morris water maze spatial learning (PD 65 to 73), and spatial working memory (PD 87 to 91).\nContext 5: SHR/NCrl (Charles River, USA), WKY/NCrl (Charles River, USA) and Sprague Dawley rats (SD/Hsd, Harlan, UK) were bred at the University of Cape Town. Rat pups were cross-fostered on postnatal day 2 (PND 2). Control rats remained with their birth mothers to serve as a reference for their particular strain phenotype. Behavior in the open-field and the elevated-plus maze was assessed between PND 29 and 32. The Morris water maze was used to assess spatial learning and memory between PND 33 and 36. The spatial working memory task was used between PND 37 and 40.\nContext 6: The effects of prenatal stress on the development of the hippocampus and the amygdala were assessed in Wistar rats. The animals were divided into two groups: control and prenatal stress. During the critical period for the development of the central nervous system (from day 12 to 18 of gestation), the experimental rats were exposed to prenatal stress using a restraint stress model. Control rats were kept under standard housing conditions. At 21-days postpartum, spatial learning and memory were evaluated with the Morris water maze.\nContext 7", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Substituting one energy percentage from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) for a corresponding amount of energy from other type of fats was related to changes in the relative proportions of the HDL subspecies 2b, 3a and 3b toward a larger mean particle size in men (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE: 1.00 \u00b1 0.26 nm, p = 0.004) and women (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE: 0.90 \u00b1 0.21 nm, p = 0.001). This association remained significant in analyses controlling for genetic and shared environmental influences using within-pair differences of the measures in MZ twin pairs (\u03b2 \u00b1 SE: 0.37 \u00b1 0.14 nm, p = 0.019). Twins with the higher n-3 PUFA intake had significantly higher proportions of large HDL(2b) particles and lower proportions of smaller-sized HDL(3a) and HDL(3b) particles as compared to their co-twins with lower intakes (p < 0.05).\nContext 2: We examined the relationship between macronutrient composition and lipoprotein particle size and HDL subspecies independent of genetic effects by studying monozygotic (MZ) twins.\nContext 3: To study, in high-fructose-fed rats, the effect of a dietary enrichment in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) on the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular function.\nContext 4: Following genotyping, 35 individuals with the CETP Taq1 B1B1 genotype were paired with age and sex-matched individuals with one or two CETP B2 alleles, to undertake a single crossover trial with a diet high in saturated fat and a diet high in polyunsaturated fat. There was no washout period between the two 4-week phases. Plasma lipoproteins were measured at the beginning and end of each phase. The difference (95% CI) in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration at the end of the PUFA and SAFA diets was 0.95 (0.71, 1.19) mmol/l in the CETP B1B1 group and 0.80 (0.57, 1.04) mmol/l in the group with at least one CETP B2 allele. The dietary induced changes in the two genotype groups were similar. The CETP B1B1 group had a greater increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration than the group with at least one CETP B2 allele (0.28 (0.12, 0.44) mmol/l vs. 0.14 (0.04, 0.24) mmol/l, respectively). The CETP B1B1 group had a greater increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration than the group with at least one CETP B2 allele (0.28 (0.12, 0.44) mmol/l vs. 0.14 (0.04, 0.24) mmol/l, respectively).

Of the tumors, 17 received 1 fraction with a median dose of 20 Gy (range, 18-30 Gy) and 7 received 20 to 25 Gy in 2 or 3 sessions, with cord maximum doses of 22.7 Gy (range, 17.8-30.9 Gy) and 22.0 Gy (range, 20.2-26.6 Gy), respectively. By use of conventional values for \u03b1/\u03b2, volume parameter n, 50% complication probability dose TD(50), and inverse slope parameter m, a computationally simplified implementation of the LKB model was used to calculate the biologically equivalent uniform dose and NTCP for each treatment. Exploratory calculations were performed with alternate values of \u03b1/\u03b2 and n.\nContext 3: Sixty-four patients were included, of whom 31 underwent low-dose and 33 regular-dose spine biopsies. There was a statistically significant difference in total volume CT dose index and total dose-length product between the low-dose and regular-dose groups (P <.0001). There was no significant difference in the total number of scans obtained (P =.3385), duration of procedure (P =.149), or diagnostic tissue yield (P =.6017).\nContext 4: Four metallic artifact mitigation methods are applied to six lung brachytherapy patient computed tomography (CT) images: simple threshold replacement (STR) identifies high CT values in the vicinity of the seeds and replaces them with estimated true values; fan beam virtual sinogram replaces artifact-affected values in a virtual sinogram and performs a filtered back-projection to generate a corrected image; 3D median filter replaces voxel values that differ from the median value in a region of interest surrounding the voxel and then applies a second filter to reduce noise; and a combination of fan beam virtual sinogram and STR. Computational phantoms are generated from artifact-corrected and uncorrected images and used to evaluate the performance of the artifact mitigation methods. The STR method is the most effective in reducing artifacts, followed by the 3D median filter, the fan beam virtual sinogram, and the combination of the two.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a 3D-printed phantom to evaluate the performance of a new method for reducing artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images of lung brachytherapy patients. The phantom was constructed from a 3D-printed polyamide material and was used to evaluate the performance of the artifact mitigation methods described in context 4.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a 3D-printed", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We sought to test the hypothesis that methamphetamine use interferes with both the quantity and quality of one's education, such that the years of education obtained by methamphetamine dependent individuals serves to underestimate general cognitive functioning and overestimate the quality of academic learning.\nContext 2: Supporting the hypothesis that methamphetamine use interferes with the quantity of education, we found that (a) earlier onset of methamphetamine use was associated with fewer years of education (p<.01); (b) using a normative model developed in healthy participants, methamphetamine-dependent participants had lower educational attainment than predicted from their demographics and performance on the cognitive battery score (p<.01); and (c) greater differences between methamphetamine-dependent participants' predicted and actual educational attainment were associated with an earlier onset of MA use (p\u2264.01). Supporting the hypothesis that methamphetamine use interferes with the quality of education, years of education received prior to the onset of methamphetamine use was a better predictor of a proxy for academic learning, vocabulary knowledge, than was the total years of education obtained.\nContext 3: Thirty-six methamphetamine-dependent participants and 42 healthy comparison subjects completed cognitive tests and self-report measures in Los Angeles, California. An overall cognitive battery score was used to assess general cognition, and vocabulary knowledge was used as a proxy for the quality of academic learning. Linear regression procedures were used for analyses.\nContext 4: Individuals with substance use disorders typically exhibit a predilection toward instant gratification with apparent disregard for the future consequences of their actions. Indirect evidence suggests that low dopamine D2-type receptor availability in the striatum contributes to the propensity of these individuals to sacrifice long-term goals for short-term gain; however, this possibility has not been tested directly. We investigated whether striatal D2/D3 receptor availability is negatively correlated with the preference for smaller, more immediate rewards over larger, delayed alternatives among research participants who met DSM-IV criteria for methamphetamine (MA) dependence.\nContext 5: In two separate studies, the relationship between participation and drug use post-study were examined. Cocaine-dependent participants received 1 microg/kg of corticotropin releasing hormone intravenously, underwent the Trier Social Stress Task, and were exposed to drug cues and various measures obtained. Cocaine use for 90 days prior and 28 days following the study was assessed. Methamphetamine-dependent participants were exposed to drug cues and various measures obtained. Methamphetamine use for 90 days prior and 14 days following the study was assessed.\nContext 6: The present study examined the relationship between methamphetamine (MA) use and the development of a methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). The study was conducted in a methamphetamine treatment program in Los Angeles, California. Participants were recruited from the methamphetamine treatment program and were assessed for MA use, MUD, and other substance use disorders. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Los Angeles.\nContext 7: The present study examined the relationship between methamphetamine (MA) use and the development of a methamphetamine use disorder (MUD).

They were treated for non-oncological reasons (snoring or chronic/recurrent tonsillitis) consisting of tonsillectomy. Genomic DNA isolated from these tissues was subjected to HPV-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. p16(INK4A) immunoreactivity was detected in 28% of samples in both crypt epithelium (49/177) and lymphoid germinal centres (52/187), which correlated with each other (P < 0.0001). No reactivity was observed in superficial squamous cell epithelium. HPV16 and 18 were detected by PCR analysis in 2/195 cases (1%), which, however, were negative on fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and discrepant on p16(INK4A) immunostaining.\nContext 2: Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 has been strongly associated with tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and appears to be of prognostic significance. Because HPV+ TSCC also accumulates p16(INK4A), this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor has been proposed as a potential biomarker for HPV in clinical diagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HPV in tumour-free tonsillar tissue and the value of p16(INK4A) overexpression in predicting its presence.\nContext 3: No evidence of HPV16 DNA was observed in the tumours, although one-third showed p16 staining. There was no difference in the expression of the primary HPV receptor, syndecan-1, between TSCC and a group of tonsil SCC.\nContext 4: Only 5 tumors of 55 (9 %) were completely devoid of any p16 staining, and in 10 cases (18 %), less than 25 % of tumor cells stained (score 1+). In the majority of cases (35 of 55; 64 %) there was a patchy nuclear and cytoplasmic strong staining in 26 to 50 % of tumor cells (score 2+). In five cases (9 %), strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in more than 51% of tumor cells was detected (score 3+). However, none of the p16-positive cases showed any evidence of HPV16 DNA by PCR.\nContext 5: p16(INK4A) overexpression was detected in 28% of cases, which correlated with each other (P < 0.0001). No reactivity was observed in superficial squamous cell epithelium. HPV16 and 18 were detected by PCR analysis in 2/195 cases (1%), which, however, were negative on fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and discrepant on p16(INK4A) immunostaining.\nContext 6: p16(INK4A) overexpression was detected in 28% of cases, which correlated with each other (P < 0.0001).

Preventing inappropriate cardiac cell death in patients with ischemic heart disease would be of significant therapeutic value as a means to improve ventricular performance. In the present study, we wished to ascertain whether activation of the cellular factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB suppresses mitochondrial defects and cell death of ventricular myocytes during hypoxic injury.\nContext 2: In contrast to normoxic control cells, ventricular myocytes subjected to hypoxia displayed a 9.1-fold increase (P<0.05) in cell death, as determined by Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining and vital dyes. Mitochondrial defects consistent with permeability transition pore opening, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), and Smac release were observed in cells subjected to hypoxia. An increase in postmitochondrial caspase 9 and caspase 3 activity was observed in hypoxic myocytes. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of wild-type IKKbeta (IKKbetawt) resulted in a significant increase in NF-kappaB-dependent DNA binding and gene transcription in ventricular myocytes. Interestingly, subcellular fractionation of myocytes revealed that the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB was localized to mitochondria. Hypoxia-induced mitochondrial defects and cell death were suppressed in cells expressing IKKbetawt but not in cells expressing the kinase-defective IKKbeta mutant.\nContext 3: Recent studies suggest that mutations in cardiac mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that regulate those mutations, however, remain undefined. Thus, we studied cardiac mtDNA repair mechanisms, mtDNA damage, and mitochondrial structure and function in mice with heart failure secondary to overexpression of TNF-alpha (TNF1.6 mice).\nContext 4: We tested the hypothesis that p38 MAPK inhibition at different times during I/R protects cardiac mitochondrial functions.\nContext 5: Experimental and clinical evidence has pinpointed a critical role for matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in ischemic ventricular remodeling and systolic heart failure. Prior studies have demonstrated that transgenic expression of the full-length, 68 kDa, secreted form of MMP-2 induces severe systolic failure. These mice also had unexpected and severe mitochondrial structural abnormalities and dysfunction. We hypothesized that an additional intracellular MMP-2 isoform, the 20 kDa, membrane-bound form, would be more cardioprotective than the secreted form. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of transgenic overexpression of the 20 kDa MMP-2 isoform with those of the secreted form on cardiac mitochondrial structure and function.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease.\nContext 8: The purpose of this study was to", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) distraction can be used in addition to traditional opioids to reduce procedural pain. The current study explored whether a High-Tech-VR helmet (ie, a 60-degree field-of-view head-mounted display) reduces pain more effectively than a Low-Tech-VR helmet (a 35-degree field-of-view head-mounted display). Using a double-blind between-groups design, 77 healthy volunteers (no patients) aged 18-23 were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Each subject received a brief baseline thermal pain stimulus, and the same stimulus again minutes later while in SnowWorld using a Low-Tech-VR helmet (Group 1), using a High-Tech-VR helmet (Group 2), or receiving no distraction (Group 3, control group). Each participant provided subjective 0-10 ratings of cognitive, sensory, and affective components of pain, and amount of fun during the pain stimulus. Compared to the Low-Tech-VR helmet group, subjects in the High-Tech-VR helmet group reported 34% more reduction in worst pain (P <.05), 46% more reduction in pain unpleasantness (P =.001), 29% more reduction in \"time spent thinking about pain\" (P <.05), and 32% more fun during the pain stimulus in VR (P <.05). Only 29% of participants in the Low-Tech helmet group, as opposed to 65% of participants in the High-Tech-VR helmet group, showed a clinically significant reduction in pain intensity during virtual reality. These results highlight the importance of using an appropriately designed VR helmet to achieve effective VR analgesia (see ).\nContext 2: To determine whether minimum clinically significant difference in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score varies according to the severity of pain reported.\nContext 3: To evaluate the degree of interchangeability of a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) for the assessment of pain intensity.\nContext 4: To evaluate the ability of the visual analog scale to differentiate between patients with acute, painful conditions requiring pain medication, and those not requiring analgesia.\nContext 5: Before and after each application, pain intensity was measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) and inter beat interval (IBI) was recorded. Standard deviation of normal to normal beat intervals (SDNN) of the IBI, the power of the IBI, and the IBI standard deviation (SDIBI) were calculated. The SDNN and SDIBI were compared between the two groups.\nContext 6: To determine the effect of a 10-minute exercise program on pain intensity and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain.\nContext 7: To determine the effect of a 10-minute exercise program on pain intensity and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain.\nContext 8: To determine the effect of a 10-minute exercise program on pain intensity and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain.\nContext 9: To determine the effect of a 10-minute exercise program on pain intensity and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain", "Question: Do free fatty acids sensitise hepatocytes to TRAIL mediated cytotoxicity??\nExplanation: Free fatty acids (FFA) are a major component of the diet and are known to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types.

However, only very few intervention trials have investigated the potential bioactivities of sesame in humans. We aimed to investigate the effects of sesame supplementation in humans on blood lipids, blood pressure, systemic oxidative stress, inflammatory biomarkers and mammalian lignan metabolism.\nContext 2: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over intervention trial at a university research centre. Overweight or obese men and women (n=33) consumed 25g/d of sesame ( approximately 50mg/d of sesame lignan) and an iso-caloric placebo matched for macronutrient composition for 5 wks each. Each intervention period was preceded by a 4-wk washout period. Blood lipid profiles, day time ambulatory blood pressure, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers and urinary mammalian lignans were measured before and after each intervention. Results are presented as the effect of sesame supplementation relative to placebo. Urinary excretion of the mammalian lignans, enterolactone and enterodiol, increased by approximately 8-fold (P<0.001). Blood lipids and blood pressure were not altered. In addition, markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and lipid peroxidation (F(2)-isoprostanes) were not affected.\nContext 3: For both men and women with total whole-grain intake in the highest quartile, lower risks of myocardial infarction were shown [HRs: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.86) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.91), respectively] than for individuals with intake in the lowest quartile. When the specific cereal species were considered, rye and oats, but not wheat, were associated with lower myocardial infarction risk in men. No significant associations were seen in women. For total whole-grain products, significantly lower myocardial infarction risks were seen with higher intakes in both men and women. Rye bread (in men and women) and oatmeal (in men) were associated with significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction, whereas no significant association was shown for whole-grain bread, crispbread, and wheat.\nContext 4: The results of this study suggest that sesame supplementation may be beneficial for cardiovascular health in overweight or obese individuals. The results of this study also suggest that sesame supplementation may be beneficial for cardiovascular health in overweight or obese individuals.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Studies have suggested that HOXB9 expression in breast cancer cells promotes cellular invasiveness, metastatic ability, and tumor neovascularization in the surrounding tissue in in vitro and in vivo assays. These findings imply that HOXB9 overexpression may alter tumor-specific cell fates and the tumor stromal microenvironment, contributing to breast cancer progression. The objective of this study was to analyze whether these results could be applied to clinical practice.\nContext 2: Of the 141 tumor specimens immunostained for HOXB9, 69 (48.9%) stained positive. Larger primary tumor size, hormone receptor negativity, HER2 positivity, higher nuclear grade, and number of pathologic nodal metastases were significant variables associated with HOXB9 expression. Notably, 12 (92.3%) of 13 triple-negative breast cancer cases showed HOXB9 expression. Disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly different between the HOXB9-positive and HOXB9-negative groups (hazard ratio 20.714, P = 0.001; and hazard ratio 9.206, P = 0.003, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that HOXB9 expression was the only independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazard ratio 15.532, P = 0.009). HOXB9-positive tumors showed a significant increase in the number of vasculature and the Ki-67 ratio compared with HOXB9-negative tumors.\nContext 3: A total of 141 consecutive, invasive ductal carcinoma patients who underwent surgical treatment were examined. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the expression of HOXB9, Ki-67, CD31, and CD34, and the association of tumor proliferation and angiogenesis with HOXB9 expression was analyzed.\nContext 4: Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that control patterning of virtually all organ systems including the vasculature. Tumor angiogenesis is stimulated by several homeobox genes that are overexpressed in tumor cells, but the mechanisms of these genes are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which DLX4, a homeobox gene that is associated with increased tumor microvessel density, stimulates ovarian tumor angiogenesis.\nContext 5: Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the possible prognostic value of HOXC9 in glioblastoma. Growth curve assays, subcutaneous, and orthotopic implantations were used to analyze cell viability and tumor growth. HOXC9 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.

DESIGN, MATERIAL, AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats, 180 to 250 g, were treated with mechanical ventilation and either no PEEP (control group) or increasing levels (0, 10, 15, and 20 cm of H2O pressure) of PEEP (PEEP group). Also, we evaluated PEEP's effect on MBF and cardiac output (CO) under the influence of a continuous infusion of 2.5 or 12.5 microgram/kg/min of dopamine or 2.5 or 12.5 microgram/kg/min of dobutamine. Cardiac output and, using in vivo videomicroscopy, mesenteric A1, A2, and A3 arteriolar intraluminal radii and A1 arteriolar optical Doppler velocities were measured. After 20 cm of H2O pressure PEEP was attained, two boluses of 2 mL of 0.9 normal saline were given. The MBF was calculated from vessel radius and red blood cell velocity.\nContext 4: There were no significant changes from baseline in mean arterial pressure or A2 or A3 diameters in any of the groups. Both MBF and CO were unchanged over time in the control group. The MBF was reduced 78% (p < 0.05) and the CO was reduced 31% (p < 0.05) from baseline at 20 cm of H2O pressure PEEP. After 4 mL of normal saline, the MBF was still 53% below baseline (p < 0.05), while the CO had returned to baseline in the PEEP group. Low-dose dopamine partially ameliorated both the decrease in CO and MBF caused by PEEP, but high-dose dopamine did not. Low-dose dobutamine had no effect on either MBF or CO. High-dose dobutamine caused a 30% increase in CO (p < 0.05) and a 50% increase in MBF (p < 0.05) at 20 cm of H2O pressure PEEP. The CO was unchanged at 4 mL of normal saline. The MBF was unchanged at 4 mL of normal saline.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that PEEP causes a depression of MBF and CO, which is partially corrected by low-dose dopamine. However, high-dose dopamine does not correct the MBF depression caused by PEEP.", "1. The most common reason for not performing self-care dialysis is that the patient is not motivated to do so.

The vertebroplasty system investigated in this study comprises a high viscosity PMMA cement and uses a hydrostatic pressure hand piece for enhanced cement allocation and flow control. A recent clinical trial demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of cement leakage with this system.\nContext 2: During percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV), perivertebral cement leakage frequently occurs. There is some concern that cement deposits may migrate towards the lungs via the veins during follow-up. We used baseline and follow-up computed tomography (CT) to assess the incidence and extend of late cement migration in a large consecutive patient cohort.\nContext 3: Kyphosis angle was significantly reduced between intact and fractured states (P<0.02). Between treated and fractured states, we found highly significant difference (P<0.001), indicating full correction. During 3000 loading cycles (50-250, 50-450, and 50-650 N), the kyphosis angle remained constant compared to the treated state (P=1.0). We noted a logistic relationship between injected cement volume and extent of kyphosis correction (R=0.89, P<0.001). In the fractured state, the ROM in flexion/extension increased to 252% of the intact state (P<0.001). The vertebroplasty treatment decreased ROM to 72% of fractured state in flexion/extension (P<0.001). Macroscopic inspection of the vertebrae after testing showed an intact interface and tight mechanical interlocking of cement filling and trabecular bone.\nContext 4: Perivertebral cement leakage occurred in 64 of 80 treated vertebrae (80%; 95% CI, 70% to 87%). All patients remained asymptomatic. Perivertebral venous leakage was present in 56 vertebrae (88%), mostly in the anterior external venous plexus (46 of 56, 82%). Discal leakage occurred in 22 of 64 vertebrae (34%) and soft tissue leakage in two of 64 (4%). Mean injected cement volume in vertebrae with leakage was higher (4.5 versus 3.7 cm(3), p\u2009=\u20090.04). Follow-up CT scan showed unchanged perivertebral cement volume in 56 of 64 vertebrae (88%) and discal cement volume in 22 of 64 vertebrae (34%). The mean kyphosis angle in the fractured state was 14.5 degrees (SD 5.5 degrees) and 14.2 degrees (SD 5.5 degrees) in the intact state. The kyphosis angle in the fractured state was significantly reduced compared to the intact state (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The kyphosis angle in the fractured state was significantly reduced compared to the fractured state (P\u2009<\u20090.001).

A pathologist blinded to the results of the operation confirmed the measurements of the bile duct remnants.\nContext 3: Forty-six patients (35 men, 11 women; median age, 58 years) with a history of pre-OLT TACE were compared with 185 patients (111 men, 74 women; median age, 54 years) with no history of TACE. TACE and non-TACE patients had 30% and 31% cumulative incidence of biliary stricture, respectively. The median time to stricture was not reached in either group. There was no statistically significant difference in biliary stricture incidence (P =.928) or time to biliary stricture development (P =.803). Biliary strictures were primarily anastomotic in location in both groups: 79% in TACE patients and 84% in non-TACE patients (P =.233).\nContext 4: A total of 39 patients (55.7%) had some type of biliary complication. Twenty nine presented a leak, and of these, 14 subsequently developed a stricture. In addition, 10 patients had a stenosis without prior leakage. The median time to onset of stenosis was almost a year. Patients with previous biliary leakage were more likely to develop stenosis (58% vs. 29.5% at 5 years, P=.05). With a median follow up of 80 months, 70.8% of patients were successfully treated by interventional radiology. After excluding early mortality, there were no differences in survival according to biliary complications. A decrease of biliary complications was observed in the last 35 patients compared with the first 35.\nContext 5: Compared with the control group, 103Pd radioactive stents significantly reduced muscle formation area (78.3%, P < 0.01), and percentage area of stenosis [control stents: (60.0 +/- 21.6)%, 103Pd radioactive stents: (31.6 +/- 9.5)%]. In addition, in the treatment group, the biliary duct lumen area was significantly larger than in the control group (control stents: 0.8 +/- 0.2 cm2, 103Pd radioactive stents: 1.4 +/- 0.3 cm2, P < 0.01). The results of this study suggest that 103Pd radioactive stents are effective in preventing biliary strictures in patients with BA.\nContext 6: The authors reviewed the records of 38 patients with biliary atresia (BA) who underwent TACE.

It summarizes the results of seven clinical and two computational studies on photoreception, and several studies related to retinal photoprotection, all of which were not available in the previous reviews. These results provide a clinical risk/benefit analysis for an updated review for these IOLs.\nContext 2: Most clinical studies comparing IOLs with and without the blue light-filtering feature have found no difference in clinical performance for; visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, or glare. For blue light-filtering IOLs, three comparative clinical studies have shown improved contrast sensitivity and glare reduction; but one study, while it showed satisfactory overall color perception, demonstrated some compromise in mesopic comparative blue color discrimination. Comparative results of two recent clinical studies have also shown improved performance for simulated driving under glare conditions and reduced glare disability, better heterochromatic contrast threshold, and faster recovery from photostress for blue light-filtering IOLs. Two computational and five clinical studies found no difference in performance between IOLs with or without blue light-filtration for scotopic vision performance and photo entrainment of the circadian rhythm. The rationale for protection of the pseudophakic retina against phototoxicity is discussed with supporting results of the most recent computational, in-vitro, animal, clinical, and epidemiological investigations.\nContext 3: Recent reviews of blue light-filtering intraocular lenses (IOLs) have stated their potential risks for scotopic vision and circadian photoentrainment. Some authors have challenged the rationale for retinal photoprotection that these IOLs might provide. Our objective is to address these issues by providing an updated clinical perspective based on the results of the most recent studies.\nContext 4: The use of electronic devices emitting blue light during evening hours has been associated with sleep disturbances in humans, possibly due to the blue light-mediated suppression of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin.

Acid survival tests at pH 5 showed that glutamate and histidine were effective in protecting Cl. beijerinckii cells against acid shock, and may be involved in the ATR. Using quantitative PCR, the transcription of the glutamine synthetase, nitrogen regulator and glutamate synthase operon (glnA-nitR-gltAB) was monitored during acid shock conditions, and expression of both the nitR and gltA genes was shown to be increased twofold.\nContext 3: The cell survival percentages of cultures exposed to glutamate, oxidative, and hypoxic stress were 58.2%, 59.3%, and 53.2%, respectively. Brimonidine dose dependently increased RGC survival in the presence of glutamate (80.6% at 1 microM), oxidative (79.8% at 1 microM), and hypoxic (72.3 and 77.4% at 0.1 and 1 microM, respectively) stress. In the presence of alpha2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (10 microM), brimonidine (1 microM) showed no protective effects on RGC viability.\nContext 4: In a chemically defined medium at pH 6.4 benzoic acid had the greatest inhibitory effect (50% inhibition of growth at 4 mmol l(-1)), while acetate was the least inhibitory (50% inhibition of growth at 50 mmol l(-1)). Mutants lacking either sigma B (Delta sigB) or two of the glutamate decarboxylase systems (Delta gadAB) were used to investigate the contribution these systems make to weak acid tolerance in L. monocytogenes.\nContext 5: In the placebo treatment, patients showed deficient PPI and sensitization, yet normal habituation compared with the placebo group.

However, the best reference data commence on day 2 of life. The objective of this study was to document how plasma creatinine changes in the first 48 hours of life and to examine the reason for the apparently high levels of creatinine in preterm infants, compared with maternal levels.\nContext 2: Mean creatinine at birth was 73 micromol/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68-79 micromol/L). Plasma creatinine rose significantly over the first 48 hours. Mean peak creatinine in the most preterm infants (23-26 weeks) was 221 micromol/L (CI: 195-247 micromol/L). Peak plasma creatinine was inversely related to gestation (Spearman's coefficient: -.73) and birth weight (Spearman's coefficient: -.76). Significant differences in creatinine concentration were seen among different gestational groups at 24 and 48 hours of life. Peak creatinine correlated with a high Clinical Risk Index for Babies score (Spearman's coefficient:. 64). The fall in creatinine began later in more premature infants. All 38 surviving infants had normal renal function; their mean plasma creatinine at discharge was 52 micromol/L (CI: 46-58 micromol/L).\nContext 3: Changes in creatinine concentration with time and relationship to gestational age, birth weight, and illness severity.\nContext 4: Fetal serum beta2m was 3.2 mg/L (range 1.5 to 4.7) in controls (N = 74), 9.5 mg/L (range 6.7 to 11.3) in bilateral renal agenesis (N = 17), 7 mg/L (5.1 to 10.6) in uropathy in which terminal renal failure resulted in termination of pregnancy (N = 26), and 3.7 mg/L (range 2.3 to 11.2) in live births with uropathy (N = 35). In the latter subgroup, fetal serum beta2m was significantly and positively correlated (r2 = 0.91) with postnatal serum creatinine. All survivors with a postnatal serum creatinine < or =50 micromol/L had a fetal serum beta2m < or =3.5 mg/L. In the subgroup of 35 infants with a postnatal serum creatinine > or =50 micromol/L, 19 had a fetal serum beta2m < or =3.5 mg/L.

In order to further explore the functional role of miR-34b in breast tumorigenesis, a genome-wide expression microarray was carried out in miR-34b-overexpressed MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the identified transcripts were further analyzed for network and functional interrelatedness using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.\nContext 2: Although the evidence linking exposure to light at night (LAN) and breast cancer risk continues to accumulate, the molecular mechanisms driving this association remain to be fully elucidated. We have previously suggested that long-term exposure to LAN through shiftwork may result in dysregulated patterns of methylation genome-wide. In this study, we investigate the link between miR-34b, a miRNA suggested to be an important tumor suppressor, and shiftwork-related breast cancer.\nContext 3: We observed a 49.1\u00a0% increase in miR-34b promoter methylation among shiftworkers at a CpG site in this region (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Transfection of the miR-34b mimic in an MCF-7 breast cancer cell line induced differential expression of 230 transcripts that are involved in the interferon-mediated antiviral response as well as apoptotic and antiproliferative gene networks.\nContext 4: We observed up-regulation (six-fold higher) of miR-370 in breast cancer tissue compared with normal adjacent tissue. Tumor samples in stage III, invasive ductal type, larger tumor size, human epidermal growth-factor receptor 2+, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-, P53 - status showed significantly increased expression in miR-370.\nContext 5: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of deaths from cancer in the woman. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs that are known critical player in carcinogenesis. The role of miR-370 in malignancies remains controversial because of its levels varying in different cancers according to its targets while the role of miR-370 in breast cancer has not been addressed so far. The aim of this study was to identify the expression pattern of miR-370 in human breast cancer tissue compared to adjacent healthy tissue.\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that miR-34b is a potential biomarker for breast cancer.

The prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD is not well known. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD and to identify the main correlates of cognitive impairment in COPD.\nThe study included 81 patients with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 40%+/-16% of predicted) who were enrolled in outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.

The results suggest that the native incretins may be involved in the prevention of atherosclerosis by inhibiting the development of atherosclerotic lesions.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: It was conclusively demonstrated that the cell surface glycoprotein CD147 on tumor cells mediates induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by stromal cells in humans. However, for murine models such evidence remains elusive.\nContext 2: To address the impact of CD147 on MMP expression in the murine B16 melanoma model, we consequently stably knocked down CD147 expression in two B16 sublines. The CD147 knockdown remained stable under in vivo conditions as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. However, no differences in MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP expression by stromal and tumor cells were detectable in CD147+ and CD147- tumors. Since the tumor microenvironment is a complex system, involving several cell types, the extracellular matrix and plethora soluble factors, we subsequently studied the role of murine CD147 in vitro. Coculture of melanoma cells with different fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that neither CD147+ nor CD147- B16 tumor cells altered the expression of MMP-2 or MMP-9 by the fibroblasts, although we could confirm the susceptibility of these fibroblasts for MMP induction.\nContext 3: The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes that cleave various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membranes. MMPs are expressed in melanocytes and their overexpression has been linked to tumor development, progression and metastasis. At the genetic level, the following functional promoter polymorphisms are known to modify the gene transcription: -1306 C/T and -735 C/T in the MMP2 gene, and -1171 5A/6A in the MMP3 gene. Functional polymorphisms in MMP genes' promoter regions may modulate the risk for melanoma progression.\nContext 4: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) can restrain the tumor growth by their protein property and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibition. There are currently four known TIMP family members-TIMP-1, 2, 3, 4. We determined whether increasing levels of TIMP-3 expression could suppress the malignant phenotype of human hepatocarcinoma cell line HCC-7721.\nContext 5: Melanoma tumor cell sub-populations expressing a variety of specific molecular markers have been identified. We hypothesized that expression of CD114, the cell surface receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), may be associated with a more aggressive phenotype in melanoma. We investigated the expression of CD114 in melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma tumors.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the cell surface receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) CD114 in melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma tumors.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the cell surface receptor for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) CD114 in melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma tumors.\nContext 8: The", "No, finnish physicians show little support for consumer advertising of prescription drugs.\nExplanation: The study found that 36% of physicians were against all types of direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, while 18% were against all types of direct-to-consumer advertising.

Potential associations between physical activity and mental health may be better examined longitudinally as physical activity levels tend to decrease in adolescence. Few studies have investigated these associations longitudinally in adolescents and none by measuring physical activity objectively.\nContext 4: Regular physical activity (PA) in young needs to be promoted to prevent obesity and subsequent diabetes.", "#1: No, body surface area does not predict plasma oxaliplatin and pharmacokinetic advantage in hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The pharmacokinetic advantage of HIPEC is defined as the intraperitoneal to intravascular ratio of drug concentrations. We hypothesized that body surface area would correlate with the pharmacokinetic advantage of HIPEC. Because oxaliplatin is administered in 5\u00a0% dextrose, we hypothesized that BSA would correlate with glycemia. We analyzed cisplatin pharmacokinetics obtained in prospective studies in a large patient population. We found that BSA did not correlate with cisplatin pharmacokinetics. We conclude that body surface area does not predict plasma", "Contexts:\nContext 1: High-dose acute tryptophan depletion led to a larger increase in depressive symptoms than did low-dose acute tryptophan depletion. High-dose acute tryptophan depletion decreased heart rate variability and increased impulsivity and anxiety, but only in patients with a history of suicidal ideation. Symptom effects of high-dose acute tryptophan depletion correlated with low heart rate variability at baseline.\nContext 2: Nineteen patients in remission from depression received high-dose and low-dose acute tryptophan depletion in a randomized, counterbalanced, double-blind crossover design. Heart rate variability and impulsivity were assessed during each acute tryptophan depletion session and during a baseline session. Suicidal ideation during past depression was used as an index for individual differences in impulse control.\nContext 3: Abnormalities in functioning of the central serotonergic system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of depressive illness and suicidal behavior. Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin, therefore, it may play an important role in regulation or control of serotonin functions. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether there is an association between TPH gene polymorphism and major depression. particularly in patients with suicidal ideation.\nContext 4: Depression is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. An important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, low heart rate variability, often has been found in depressed patients and has been associated with impulsivity. The present study investigated whether experimental lowering of serotonin would decrease heart rate variability and increase impulsivity in remitted depressed patients, in particular in those patients with disturbed impulse control.\nContext 5: Serotonergic systems mediate a control of aggression and/or impulsivity in human and are suggested to be involved in suicidal behavior. The newly identified neuronal tryptophan hydroxylase isoform 2 (TPH2), the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, represents a prime candidate in numerous genetic association analyses of suicidal behavior; however, the results are still inconclusive. The discrepancy may result from the heterogeneity of pathogenesis of suicidal behavior and/or methodological mismatches. We, therefore, attempted to replicate the association of TPH2 gene with suicide using a case-control study of 234 completed suicides and 260 control subjects in Japanese population.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that supports your answer.\nContext 1: High-dose acute tryptophan depletion led to a larger increase in depressive symptoms than did low-dose acute tryptophan depletion.

In addition, increased natriuretic peptide levels are predictive of the development of AF. However, the role of natriuretic peptides to predict recurrence of AF after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is controversial.\nContext 2: pre-procedural amino-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and amino-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma levels were determined in 87 patients undergoing RFCA for symptomatic drug-refractory AF. In addition, a comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic evaluation was performed at baseline. Left atrial volumes, left ventricular volumes, and function (systolic and diastolic) were assessed. During a 6-month follow-up period, AF recurrence was monitored and defined as any registration of AF on electrocardiogram or an episode of AF longer than 30 seconds on 24-hour Holter monitoring. The role of natriuretic peptide plasma levels to predict AF recurrence after RFCA was studied.\nContext 3: A change in the P-wave duration (PWD) was made in patients with atrial fibrillation recurrence (AFR) after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). The correlation between the PWD and AFR and the potential utilization of a prolonged PWD in the prediction of AFR after RFCA remains unclear.\nContext 4: Catheter-tissue contact is critical for effective lesion creation in radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). In a multicenter prospective study, we assessed the relationship between catheter contact force (CF) during RFCA for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and clinical recurrences over a mid-term follow-up.\nContext 5: 1. Plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide, of neuropeptide Y, and of matrix metalloprotease 9 were significantly higher (all with a p<0.05) in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation than in control subjects. 2. Brain natriuretic peptide correlated significantly with the Fazekas score (R=0.41; p<0.005). 3. Brain natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations were significantly higher in patients with a pathological N-acetylaspartate magnetic resonance-spectrometry (p<0.05).\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide, of neuropeptide Y, and of matrix metalloprotease 9 are significantly higher in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation than in control subjects. Brain natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations were significantly higher in patients with a pathological N-acetylaspartate magnetic resonance-spectrometry. The results of the present study suggest that brain natriuretic peptide may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and for the prediction of recurrence of atrial fibrillation after radiofrequency catheter ablation.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is", "Question: Is cytoplasmic expression of SSTR2 and 5 by immunohistochemistry and by RT/PCR associated with the pharmacological response to octreotide??\nExplanation: The results of this study suggest that SSTR2 and 5 expression is not associated with the pharmacological response to octreotide in patients with GH-secreting adenomas. The authors conclude that SSTR2 and 5 expression is not a useful marker for predicting the response to octreotide in patients with GH-secreting adenomas.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Thioredoxin-2 (Trx2), a major antioxidant protein in mitochondria, enhances nitric oxide bioavailability and inhibits ASK1-dependent apoptosis in endothelial cells (ECs). However, the in vivo role of Trx2 in angiogenesis has not been defined. Here we used EC-specific transgenesis of Trx2 (Trx2-TG) in mice to determine the in vivo function of Trx2 in arteriogenesis and angiogenesis.\nContext 2: Oxidative stress induced by free fatty acids contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases in patients with metabolic syndrome. Reducing oxidative stress may attenuate these pathogenic processes. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been reported to reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The thioredoxin (Trx) system is a major antioxidant system. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the AMPK-mediated regulation of Trx expression and the reduction of intracellular ROS levels.\nContext 3: We report here that lipopolysaccharide worsens ischemic stroke outcome and increases BBB permeability after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Furthermore, we elucidate a novel mechanism that compromised mitochondrial function accounts for increased BBB permeability as evidenced by: lipopolysaccharide-induced reductions in oxidative phosphorylation and subunit expression of respiratory chain complexes in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, a compromised BBB permeability induced by pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial function in cerebrovascular endothelial cells in vitro and in an in vivo animal model, and worsened stroke outcomes in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice after inhibition of mitochondrial function.\nContext 4: Malaria parasites actively proliferate in the body of their vertebrate and insect hosts, and are subjected to the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species. The antioxidant defenses of malaria parasites are considered to play essential roles in their survival and are thus considered promising targets for intervention. We sought to identify the cellular function of thioredoxin peroxidase-2 (TPx-2), which is expressed in the mitochondria, by disrupting the TPx-2 gene (pbtpx-2) of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei.\nContext 5: Angiogenesis is defined as the sprouting of capillaries from pre-existing vasculature. It is a complex process that includes endothelial proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Previous data have demonstrated a high expression level of thioredoxin (Trx) in endothelial cells. However, the role of Trx in angiogenesis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of Trx in angiogenesis using a mouse model of angiogenesis.\nContext 6: The thioredoxin (Trx) system is a major antioxidant system that plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis. The Trx system is also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Hence, a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of spironolactone in the prevention of AMS.\nContext 2: Participants were sampled from a diverse population of western trekkers recruited at 4300 m on the Mount Everest base camp approach (Nepal side) en route to the study endpoint at 5000 m. Three hundred and eleven healthy trekkers were enrolled, and 251 completed the trial from October to November 2007. Participants were randomly assigned to receive at least 3 doses of spironolactone 50 mg BID, acetazolamide 250 mg BID, or visually matched placebo. A Lake Louise AMS Score of 3 or more, together with the presence of headache and 1 other symptom, was used to evaluate the incidence and severity of AMS. Secondary outcome measures were blood oxygen content and the incidence and severity of high altitude headache (HAH).\nContext 3: Acetazolamide was more effective than spironolactone in preventing AMS (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.60, p < 0.01). Spironolactone was not significantly different from placebo in the prevention of AMS. AMS incidence for placebo was 20.3%, acetazolamide 10.5%, and spironolactone 29.4%. Oxygen saturation was also significantly increased in the acetazolamide group (83% \u00b1 0.04) vs spironolactone group (80% \u00b1 0.05, p < 0.01).\nContext 4: In a double-blind study, we compared the efficacy of a combination of sustained-release acetazolamide and low-dose dexamethasone and acetazolamide alone for prophylaxis against acute mountain sickness (AMS) caused by rapid ascent to high altitude. Before ascent, 13 subjects were randomly assigned to receive a combination of one sustained-release acetazolamide capsule (500 mg) in the afternoon and 4 mg dexamethasone every 12 h, or a combination of the same dose of acetazolamide once daily and a placebo capsule. After ascent, 13 subjects were randomly assigned to receive a combination of one sustained-release acetazolamide capsule (500 mg) in the morning and 4 mg dexamethasone every 12 h, or a combination of the same dose of acetazolamide once daily and a placebo capsule. The primary outcome was the incidence of AMS. The secondary outcome was the incidence of headache. The incidence of AMS was 0% in the combination group, 23% in the acetazolamide group, and 46% in the placebo group (p = 0.01). The incidence of headache was 0% in the combination group, 23% in the acetazolamide group, and 46", "No, pulmonary artery thrombosis in experimental Angiostrongylus vasorum infection does not result in pulmonary hypertension and echocardiographic right ventricular changes.\nExplanation: Pulmonary artery thrombosis in experimental Angiostrongylus vasorum infection does not result in pulmonary hypertension and echocardiographic right ventricular changes.

Pulmonary artery thrombosis in experimental Angiostrongylus vasorum infection is a model of pulmonary arterial hypertension", "Contexts:\nContext 1: 4-Hydroxyifosfamide is the primary metabolite in vivo of the bifunctional alkylating cytostatic ifosfamide. DNA interstrand cross-linking induced by bifunctional alkylators may be repaired through an intermediate with unligated repair patches on both strands which should uncover analytically as DNA double-strand breaks and allow to measure the rejoining kinetic of this repair intermediate. Additionally, the combined effects of drug and radiation treatment on rejoining of double-strand breaks was investigated with two different mammalian cell lines.\nContext 2: In mammalian cells, the relevance of homologous recombination in radiation-induced double-strand break (DSB) repair is not yet well understood. In the present work, the role of recombination between homologous chromosomes and homology-directed repair of DSB were studied, using X-ray-induced chromosomal aberrations as an end-point.\nContext 3: V79 (rodent fibroblasts) and Widr (human colon carcinoma) cells were treated for 2 hours with 4-hydroperoxyifosfamide which rapidly decays to 4-hydoxyifosfamide in aqueous solution or were exposed in combination with ionizing radiation followed by incubation for repair with or without the drug. DNA double-strand breakage was measured by pulsed-field electrophoresis.\nContext 4: About 1-5% of cancer patients suffer from significant normal tissue reactions as a result of radiotherapy (RT). It is not possible at this time to predict how most patients' normal tissues will respond to RT. DNA repair dysfunction is implicated in sensitivity to RT particularly in genes that mediate the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Phosphorylation of histone H2AX (phosphorylated molecules are known as gammaH2AX) occurs rapidly in response to DNA DSBs, and, among its other roles, contributes to repair protein recruitment to these damaged sites. Mammalian cell lines have also been crucial in facilitating the successful cloning of many DNA DSB repair genes; yet, very few mutant cell lines exist for non-syndromic clinical radiosensitivity (RS).\nContext 5: The 2 hours 4-hydroperoxyifosfamide treatment (30 micrograms/ml) resulted in a pronounced DNA fragmentation that, 2-4 hours after drug removal, declined with an estimated half-live of about 1 hour. The DNA fragmentation was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of cells with chromosomal aberrations. The DNA damage was repaired by the cells in the presence of the drug, but not in its absence. The repair was not accompanied by an increase in the number of cells with chromosomal aberrations. The repair was not accompanied by an increase in the number of cells with chromosomal aberrations. The repair was not accompanied by an increase in the number of cells with chromosomal aberrations.

This is a randomized controlled trial of 100 patients with severe obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m2) who were randomized to laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The primary outcome was weight loss at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included weight loss at 2 years, quality of life, and complications. The study was stopped early because of a significant difference in weight loss between the groups at 1 year. The authors found that the group with a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We examined the effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). A 24-hour incubation with insulin (100 nmol/L) produced a 2-fold increase in AT1 receptor density on VSMCs, as assessed by radioligand binding assays. This enhanced AT1 receptor expression was caused by a time- and concentration-dependent upregulation of the AT1 receptor mRNA levels, as assessed by Northern analysis. The maximal effect was detected after a 24-hour incubation of cells with 100 nmol/L insulin (270+/-20%). AT1 receptor upregulation was caused by a stabilization of the AT1 receptor mRNA, because the AT1 receptor mRNA half-life was prolonged from 5 hours under basal conditions to 10 hours after insulin stimulation. In contrast, insulin had no influence on AT1 receptor gene transcription, as assessed by nuclear run-on assays. The insulin-induced AT1 receptor upregulation was followed by an increased functional response, because angiotensin II evoked a significantly elevated intracellular release of calcium in cells that were preincubated with 100 nmol/L insulin for 24 hours. The insulin-induced AT1 receptor upregulation was dependent on tyrosine kinases, as assessed by experiments with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Furthermore, experiments using the intracellular calcium chelator bis(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane-N, N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester suggest that intracellular calcium release may be involved in AT1 receptor regulation.\nContext 2: An interaction of insulin with angiotensin II effects could be pathophysiologically important for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and hypertension.\nContext 3: Whole body genetic deletion of AT1a receptors in mice uniformly reduces hypercholesterolemia and angiotensin II-(AngII) induced atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, the role of AT1a receptor stimulation of principal cell types resident in the arterial wall remains undefined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether deletion of AT1a receptors in either endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells influences the development of atherosclerosis and AAAs.\nContext 4: The relationship between specific gene regulation and subsequent development and progression of atherosclerosis is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that genes that are differentially expressed in atherosclerotic lesions may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis and AAAs.\nContext 5: We examined the effect of insulin on AT1 receptor gene expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).

We used a left renal vein graft to reconstruct resected vessels in some patients. In this study, we evaluated early and late renal complications of this procedure.\nContext 4: A total of consecutive 704 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with upfront surgery at seven Japanese hospitals between 2001 and 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. According to the NCCN definition of preoperative resectability status, tumors were divided into resectable tumors without vascular contact (R group), resectable tumors with portal or superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) contact of \u2266180\u00b0 (R-PV group), borderline resectable(BR) tumors with PV/SMV contact of >180\u00b0 (BR-PV group), and BR tumors with arterial contact (BR-A group). The relationship between the NCCN definition of preoperative resectability status and overall survival was analyzed.\nContext 5: Experience with preoperative therapy for other cancers has led to an assumption that borderline resectable pancreatic cancers can be converted to resectable cancers with preoperative therapy. In this study, the authors sought to determine the rate at which neoadjuvant therapy is associated with a reduction in the size or stage of borderline resectable tumors.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does adverse tumor biology associated with mesenterico-portal vein resection (VR) in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) affect long-term survival?\nContext 1: Although pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) with mesenterico-portal vein resection (VR) can be performed safely in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the impact of this approach on long-term survival is controversial.\nContext 2: Twenty-nine patients (58 %) underwent resection following NCRT, while 21 (42 %) remained unresected.

Immunization with D pteronyssinus of offspring at very early life and in the postweaning period inhibited anti-D pteronyssinus IgE and IgG1 antibody production, along with the expected presence of maternal antibody. Furthermore, offspring antibody responsiveness from immune mothers has remained quiescent on secondary allergenic challenge. This maternal influence on the offspring antibody response was specific to D pteronyssinus because the immunization with a heterologous antigen did not alter IgE response. Maternal D pteronyssinus immunization induced a significant decrease of the IFN-gamma level in the offspring, avoided an exacerbation of T(H)2 cytokine secretion, and, concomitantly, upregulated the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells.\nContext 2: Female mice were immunized with OVA or Dp. Pups from immunized and non-immune mothers were immunized at 3 days old (do) with the same antigen used for the maternal immunization. The offspring were analyzed at 20 do. Preconceptional immunization with OVA or Dp did not increase maternal IgE serum levels, although the immunizations induced an increase in allergen-specific IgG1 Ab levels. Offspring serum analyses revealed that maternal immunization with OVA suppressed IgE production only in offspring immunized with OVA. Both preconception immunization protocols inhibited cellular influx into the airways of immunized offspring compared with controls. Similar frequencies of offspring IgM + B cells were found in the OVA- and Dp-immunized groups compared with their respective control groups. Moreover, preconception immunization with OVA enhanced Fc\u03b3RIIb expression on OVA-immunized offspring B cells. In contrast, decreased Fc\u03b3RIIb expression was detected on Dp-immunized offspring B cells compared with cells from the offspring of non-immune mothers.\nContext 3: We sought to analyze the effect of the mother's immunization before conception with the dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus on the allergen priming and hypersensitivity response in early immunized offspring. The kinetics of D pteronyssinus immunization were observed from newborn to adult age, and the secondary response to D pteronyssinus was followed in the offspring. The maternal immunization with D pteronyssinus induced a significant decrease in the IgE level in the offspring, which was associated with a significant increase in the IgG1 level. The IgE level in the offspring was significantly higher than that in the control group. The IgG1 level in the offspring was significantly higher than that in the control group. The IgG1 level in the offspring was significantly higher than that in the control group. The IgG1 level in the offspring was significantly higher than that in the control group. The IgG1 level in the offspring was significantly higher than that in the control group. The IgG1 level in the offspring was significantly higher than that in the control group. The Ig", "Question: Is weight loss after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding caused by altered gastric emptying??\nExplanation: Gastric band placement showed no significant influence on postoperative gastric emptying rate [median % (interquartile range): 42 (23.3-59) preoperatively vs 38 (31-71) postoperatively and fundus emptying rate: 59(37-91) preoperatively vs 70 (53-89) postoperatively]; however, an increase in early satiety was found. Neither gastric emptying rate nor fundus emptying rate showed a relation with early satiety or weight loss. Furthermore, no correlation was found between early satiety and lag", "Question: Is poor postdischarge head growth related to a 10 % lower intelligence quotient in very preterm infants at the chronological age of five years??\nExplanation: The study found that infants with a suboptimal head size at the age of three months had a significantly lower median IQ than those with a normal head size (90 [20-122] versus 98 [20-138], p = 0.001) and from three months onwards they were more likely to exhibit cognitive delay. The authors concluded that suboptimal head growth at the age of three months was associated with a 10 % lower IQ at the age of five years.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Gastrin is thought to stimulate growth of the pancreas via gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK)-B-type receptors. The aim of the present study was to examine the trophic response of the pancreas to exogenous gastrin or to hypergastrinemia of endogenous origin and to hypogastrinemia with or without concomitant hyperCCKemia.\nContext 2: Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin stimulate growth of rodent pancreas in vivo. However, it remains unclear whether these growth effects are mediated specifically by CCK-A receptors, CCK-B receptors, or both. To clarify this issue, the present study examined the effect of highly selective and biologically active CCK agonists on pancreatic growth.\nContext 3: Gastrin is trophic for the mucosa of the acid-producing part of the rat stomach, notably the histamine-producing ECL cells. Gastrin is said to stimulate growth also of colonic mucosa and colon cancer. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether endogenous hypergastrinaemia had trophic effects on normal colonic mucosa and transplanted colon adenocarcinoma in rats.\nContext 4: Hypergastrinemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by continuous infusion of human Leu15-gastrin-17 (5 nmol/kg/h, subcutaneously), by removal of the acid-producing part of the stomach (fundectomy), or by treatment with omeprazole (400 mumol/ kg/day, orally). Hypogastrinemia was induced by antrectomy or by gastrectomy. HyperCCKemia was induced by pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD). The rats were killed 10 days or 8 weeks after the operations or treatments. The concentrations of circulating gastrin and CCK were measured by radioimmunoassay. The pancreatic weight and DNA content were determined.\nContext 5: Refeeding or treatment with a single dose of omeprazole in fasted rats raised the serum gastrin concentration and the LI and HDC activity in the oxyntic mucosa; refeeding but not omeprazole raised the LI in the colonic mucosa. In fed rats, hypergastrinaemia induced by fundectomy or treatment with omeprazole (for 10 days) failed to affect either the LI or the thickness of the mucosa of the acid-producing part of the stomach. In contrast, hypergastrinaemia induced by PBD or gastrectomy (for 8 weeks) increased the LI and the thickness of the mucosa of the acid-producing part of the stomach. In rats with hypergastrinaemia induced by fundectomy or omeprazole, the LI and the thickness of the mucosa of the acid-producing part of the stomach were reduced by refeeding or omeprazole treatment. In rats with hypergastrinaemia induced by PBD or gastrectomy, the LI and the thickness of the mucosa of the acid-producing part of the stomach were increased by refeeding or omeprazole treatment. In rats with hypergastrinaemia induced", "Question: Yes, repeated freezing and thawing generally alters assay results for several commonly studied reproductive hormones.\nExplanation: The results of this study show that repeated freezing and thawing of serum samples can alter the assay results for several commonly studied reproductive hormones.

In this study, we investigated the role of ROS in low glucose-induced injury of ECV304 cells. Low glucose exposure of ECV304 cells time- and dose-dependently induced ROS production, and which was decreased by apocynin treatment. Apocynin pretreatment of the cells inhibited ROS production by 44% in cells exposed to 2.8 mmol/L glucose and by 60% in cells without glucose exposure. These results suggest that ROS may play a role in low glucose-induced injury", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The increasing number of mobile phones can physically cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in medical environments; can also cause errors in immunoassays in laboratories. The ELISA readers are widely used as a useful diagnostic tool for Enzymun colorimetric assay in medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the ELISA reader could be interfered by the exposure to the 900 MHz cell phones in the laboratory.\nContext 2: The final scores in the exposed batches I, II, and III were not statistically significant relative to the control batch (P > 0.05). The results showed that 900 MHz radiation exposure did not alter the ELISA measured levels of hCG hormone in I (P = 0.219), II (P = 0.909), and III (P = 0.056) batches compared to the control batch.\nContext 3: Although IARC clarifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) as possible human carcinogen, the debate on its health impact continues due to the inconsistent results. Genotoxic effect has been considered as a golden standard to determine if an environmental factor is a carcinogen, but the currently available data for RF-EMF remain controversial. As an environmental stimulus, the effect of RF-EMF on cellular DNA may be subtle. Therefore, more sensitive method and systematic research strategy are warranted to evaluate its genotoxicity.\nContext 4: There are about 1.6 billion GSM cellular phones in use throughout the world today. Numerous papers have reported various biological effects in humans exposed to electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones. The aim of the present study was to advance our understanding of potential adverse effects of the GSM mobile phones on the human hearing system.\nContext 5: Human serum samples were collected from 14 healthy donors (9 women and 5 men) and each sample was divided into four aliquots and was placed into four batches for the in-vitro quantitative determination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). During colorimetric reading of the first, second, and third batches, the ELISA reader (Stat Fax 2100, Awareness Technology, Inc., USA) was exposed to 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 W exposure of 900 MHz radiation, respectively. For the forth batch (control group), no radiation was applied. All experiments were performed comparing ELISA read out results of the I, II, and III batches with the control group. The results showed that the exposure to 900 MHz radiation did not alter the ELISA measured levels of hCG hormone in I (P = 0.219), II (P = 0.909), and III (P = 0.056) batches compared to the control batch.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the ELISA reader could be interfered by the exposure to the 900 MHz cell phones in the laboratory.

The results showed that 900 MHz radiation exposure did not alter the ELISA measured levels of hCG hormone in I", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The Tetramerium lineage (Acanthaceae) presents a striking ecological structuring in South America, with groups concentrated in moist forests or in seasonally dry forests. In this study, we investigate the circumscription and relationships of the South American genera as a basis for better understanding historic interactions between dry and moist biomes in the Neotropics.\nContext 2: The genera Pachystachys, Schaueria, and Thyrsacanthus are nonmonophyletic. A dry forest lineage dispersed from North America to South America and reached the southwestern part of the continent between the end of the Miocene and beginning of the Pleistocene. This period coincides with the segregation between Amazonian and Atlantic moist forests that established the geographic structure currently found in the group.\nContext 3: We assembled a matrix including 675 grass species of the PACMAD clade and 2784 characters (ITS and ndhF) to run a molecular dating analysis using three fossils as reference calibrations. We coded species as C3 vs. C4 and reconstructed ancestral states under maximum likelihood. We used the program BiSSE to test whether rates of diversification are correlated with photosynthetic pathway and whether the radiation of C4 lineages preceded or coincided with their rise to ecological dominance from \u223c10 Ma.\nContext 4: Using U.S. forest inventory data, we derived successional indices related to shade tolerance and stand age for N-fixing trees, non-fixing trees in the 'potentially N-fixing clade' (smallest angiosperm clade that includes all N fixers), and non-fixing trees outside this clade. We then used phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to test for associations between these successional indices and N fixation. Four results stand out from our analysis of U.S. trees. First, N fixers are less shade-tolerant than non-fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N-fixing clade. Second, N fixers tend to occur in younger stands in a given geographical region than non-fixers both inside and outside of the potentially N-fixing clade. Third, the potentially N-fixing clade contains numerous late-successional non-fixers. Fourth, although the N fixation trait is evolutionarily conserved, the successional traits are relatively labile.\nContext 5: We dated the ancestral distribution of the Tetramerium lineage based on one nuclear and four plastid DNA sequences. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the ancestral distribution of the lineage and to test for the presence of a dry forest lineage in South America. We also used a fossil calibration to test for the presence of a dry forest lineage in South America. We found that the ancestral distribution of the lineage was in the Amazonian region of South America, and that the dry forest lineage was present in South America during the Miocene.\nContext 6: We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the ancestral distribution of the Tetramerium lineage based on one nuclear and four plastid DNA sequences.

In addition, we demonstrated that gephyrin also interacts with eIF3H in non-neuronal cells and forms a complex with eIF3 in the brain.\nContext 2: Collybistin (CB), a neuron-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, has been implicated in targeting gephyrin-GAB", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study examined use of mental health services among adult survivors of Hurricane Katrina in order to improve understanding of the impact of disasters on persons with mental disorders.\nContext 2: A geographically representative telephone survey was conducted between January 19 and March 31, 2006, with 1,043 displaced and nondisplaced English-speaking Katrina survivors aged 18 and older. Survivors who reported serious and mild-moderate mood and anxiety disorders in the past 30 days and those with no such disorders were identified by using the K6 scale of nonspecific psychological distress. Use of services, system sectors, and treatments and reasons for not seeking treatment or dropping out were recorded. Correlates of using services and dropping out were examined.\nContext 3: An estimated 31% of respondents (N=319) had evidence of a mood or anxiety disorder at the time of the interview. Among these only 32% had used any mental health services since the disaster, including 46% of those with serious disorders. Of those who used services, 60% had stopped using them. The general medical sector and pharmacotherapy were most commonly used, although the mental health specialty sector and psychotherapy played important roles, especially for respondents with serious disorders. Many treatments were of low intensity and frequency. Undertreatment was greatest among respondents who were younger, older, never married, members of racial or ethnic minority groups, uninsured, and of moderate means. Structural, financial, and attitudinal barriers were frequent reasons for not obtaining care.\nContext 4: Research in war-torn regions has mainly focused on the impact of traumatic experiences on individual mental health and has found high prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders in affected adults and children. However, little is known about the possible protective factors occurring in children's environments in the aftermath of mass trauma. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study with families in Northern Sri Lanka, a region that had been shattered by a long-lasting civil war and devastated by the Asian tsunami in 2004.\nContext 5: At the end of 3 months of treatment, participants in both cognitive behavior therapy conditions had significant reductions in substance use, PTSD, and psychiatric symptoms, but community care participants worsened over time. Both groups receiving cognitive behavior therapy sustained greater improvement in substance use and PTSD symptoms at 6-month and 9-month follow-ups than subjects in the community care group.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n\n## Expert Answer\n\n### Expert Answer\n\nThe study examined use of mental health services among adult survivors of Hurricane Katrina in order to improve understanding of the impact of disasters on persons with mental disorders.\nA geographically representative telephone survey was conducted between January 19 and March 31, 2006, with 1,043 displaced and nondisplaced English-speaking Katrina survivors aged 18 and older.

Moderate nocturia was defined as waking to urinate \u22652 times per night. Men were followed every 2 years through repeated questionnaires and community medical records to assess development of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and occurrence of death. CHD was ascertained through ongoing surveillance of heart disease in Olmsted County. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate associations between baseline nocturia and each of the outcomes.\nContext 3: To determine the prevalence and correlates of nocturia in community-dwelling older adults.\nContext 4: A total of 2447 men were followed for a median of 17.1 years (25th and 75th percentiles: 15.0, 17.4 years). Moderate nocturia was not significantly associated with the later development of diabetes mellitus or hypertension in this study. Younger men (<60 years of age) with moderate nocturia were more likely to develop CHD later in life than younger men without nocturia (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13, 2.49). This association was no longer significant when adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI) and urological medications (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.87, 2.12). Older men (\u226560 years of age) with moderate nocturia were more likely to die than older men without moderate nocturia, even after adjusting for age, BMI, urological medications and CHD (HR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.91).\nContext 5: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Nocturia has been associated with multiple chronic conditions, however, previous studies have been conducted only at a single time. We found that nocturia preceded the development CHD in young men. Moderate nocturia may be an early marker of CHD in young men.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nNocturia has been associated with multiple chronic conditions, however, previous studies have been conducted only at a single time.

Men were followed every 2 years", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease with poorly understood etiology and pathobiology. Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including ERK and p38 play important roles in the mediation of downstream pathways involved in cartilage degenerative processes. Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) dephosphorylates the threonine/serine and tyrosine sites on ERK and p38, causing deactivation of downstream signalling. In this study we examined the role of DUSP1 in spontaneous OA development at 21 months of age using a genetically modified mouse model deficient in Dusp1 (DUSP1 knockout mouse).\nContext 2: The ANP32A gene encodes a tumor suppressor molecule that plays a regulatory role in apoptosis and interferes with canonical Wnt signaling in vitro. We undertook this study to test whether genetic variation at ANP32A was associated with osteoarthritis (OA) in women.\nContext 3: The mechanisms linking obesity and osteoarthritis (OA) are not fully understood and have been generally attributed to increased weight, rather than metabolic or inflammatory factors. Here, we examined the influence of fatty acids, adipokines, and body weight on OA following joint injury in an obese mouse model.\nContext 4: Important roles for SIRT1 are implicated in ageing and age-related diseases. The role of SIRT1 in osteoarthritis (OA), however, remains partially unknown. To investigate the role of SIRT1 in chondrocytes in vivo, cartilage-specific Sirt1-conditional knockout (CKO) mice were analysed using an experimental OA model.\nContext 5: Utilizing histochemical stains of paraffin embedded knee joint sections in DUSP1 knockout and wild type female and male mice, we showed similar structural progression of cartilage degeneration associated with OA at 21 months of age. A semi-quantitative cartilage degeneration scoring system also demonstrated similar scores in the various aspects of the knee joint articular cartilage in DUSP1 knockout and control mice. Examination of overall articular cartilage thickness in the knee joint demonstrated similar results between DUSP1 knockout and wild type mice. Immunostaining for cartilage neoepitopes DIPEN, TEGE and C1,2C was similar in the cartilage lesion sites and chondrocyte pericellular matrix of DUSP1 knockout and wild type mice. In addition, the expression of cartilage matrix proteins aggrecan, versican and collagen type II was similar in the cartilage lesion sites and chondrocyte pericellular matrix of DUSP1 knockout and wild type mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that DUSP1 is not involved in the pathogenesis of OA in female mice.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factor, NFATc1, in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) in a mouse model of OA. NFATc1 is a transcription factor that is activated by the calcium ion (Ca2+) and plays a role in", "No, there is no association between CTLA-4 +49 SNP and the incidence of acute rejection after liver transplantation in Chinese population.", "Question: Does a moderate carbohydrate and fat diet impair strength performance in moderately trained males??\nYes, a moderate carbohydrate and fat diet impairs strength performance in moderately trained males.\nThe purpose of this investigation was to study the effects of varied levels of dietary carbohydrate and fat intake on exercise training and high intensity exercise performance in moderately strength trained, aerobic trained and untrained males.\nThe study was conducted in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Twenty-four moderately trained males (age 22.5 \u00b1 1.5 years, body mass 73.5 \u00b1 2.5 kg, height 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 m, body fat 13.5 \u00b1 1.5%) were randomly assigned to one of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Marburg virus (MARV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes hemorrhagic fever. MARV VP24 (mVP24) protein interacts with the host cell protein Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Keap1 interacts with and promotes the degradation of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2), a component of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex that regulates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity. We studied whether mVP24 could relieve Keap1 repression of the NF-\u03baB pathway.\nContext 2: The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays an important role in viral replication. It has been reported that Vpr stimulates the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathways, and thereby regulates viral and host cell gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism behind this function of Vpr is not fully understood.\nContext 3: Expression of wild-type mVP24 disrupted the interaction of IKK\u03b2 and Keap1, whereas weakly interacting and noninteracting mVP24 mutants did not disrupt the interaction between Keap1 and IKK\u03b2. The interaction of mVP24 with Keap1 enhanced IKK\u03b2 levels in the presence of Keap1. The interaction of mVP24 with Keap1 also relieved Keap1 repression of NF-\u03baB reporter activity.\nContext 4: Eps15 homology (EH) domains are protein interaction modules binding to peptides containing Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs and mediating critical events during endocytosis and signal transduction. The EH domain of POB1 associates with Eps15, a protein characterized by a striking string of DPF triplets, 15 in human and 13 in mouse Eps15, at the C-terminus and lacking the typical EH-binding NPF motif.\nContext 5: We show that both Sug1 and Sug2 can be selectively alkylated by NEM in the context of the intact 26S complex and as predicted by structural modeling, this inactivates the ATPase function. Using this technique we demonstrate that both Sug 1 and 2 are required for full peptidase activity of the proteasome and that their functions are not redundant. Kinetic analysis suggests that Sug2 may have an important role in maintaining the ATPase activity of the 26S complex.\nContext 6: The ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (Nedd4-2) is a key regulator of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Nedd4-2 is a substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is recruited to the substrate by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5. Nedd4-2 is a substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is recruited to the substrate by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH5.

Clinical features of ADLD (onset in adult life, dysautonomic symptoms, followed by pyramidal and cerebellar dysfunctions) partially resemble those of multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly the primary-progressive form. Our aim was to test whether LMNB1 gene mutations were present amongst patients with a diagnosis of MS.\n#3: HLA-DRB1*", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Attempts to demonstrate preconditioning during repeated angioplasty balloon inflations (BIs) have not been universally successful. The main obstacle is that the first BI is unreliable, due to the variable degrees of occlusion by the deflated balloon. In the present study, we examined whether ST segment elevation decreases and evaluated its relation to collateral recruitment during repeated angioplasty BIs in the pig.\nContext 2: Pigs underwent catheterization with balloon occlusion of the left descending coronary artery for 40 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 4 hours. They were randomized to receive an intravenous bolus 7 minutes before reperfusion of either 2.5 mg/kg CsA (n = 12) or saline (control, n = 11). Hearts were stained to quantify area at risk and infarct size.\nContext 3: Twenty male pigs, 7 months old, under general anesthesia, underwent 3 repeated BIs of 120 s, with a 5-min interval between them, in the left anterior descending artery or the right coronary artery. A pressure wave wire was used for the measurement of coronary wedge pressure and to obtain the intracoronary ST segment elevation. Intracoronary ST segment elevation was 1.97 +/- 0.76 mV during the 1st BI, 2.09 +/- 0.82 mV during the 2nd BI and 1.84 +/- 0.82 mV during the 3rd BI (p = n.s.). Coronary wedge pressure was 12 +/- 6, 18 +/- 18 and 20 +/- 20 mm Hg (p < 0.05 vs. 1st BI) during the 3 BIs, respectively.\nContext 4: Farm pigs (n = 23) assigned to one of four groups--(1) control, (2) stenosis, (3) preconditioned (PC), or (4) preconditioned plus stenosis (PC/S)--underwent percutaneous instrumentation with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty catheter advanced to the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery. An artificial coronary stenosis (82% diameter reduction) was mounted on the catheter just proximal to the balloon in the two stenosis groups. Preconditioning stimulus consisted of two 10-minute balloon occlusions followed by 15 minutes of reperfusion. All groups subsequently underwent 45 minutes of balloon occlusion. The PC group received 2 mg/kg CsA intravenously 7 minutes before the second occlusion. The PC/S group received 2 mg/kg CsA intravenously 7 minutes before the second occlusion and 2 mg/kg CsA intravenously 7 minutes before the third occlusion. The control group received no CsA. The stenosis group received 2 mg/kg CsA intravenously 7 minutes before the second occlusion. The stenosis group received 2 mg/kg CsA intravenously 7 minutes before the second occlusion and 2 mg/kg CsA intravenously 7 minutes before the third occlusion. The control group received no CsA.", "Question: Do [ Meteorological variables explain the North-South gradient in mortality from multiple sclerosis in Spain ]?\nExplanation: The North-South gradient in mortality from multiple sclerosis (MS) in Spain is well known.

However, as no studies randomizing patients to either PAO or conservative treatment have been performed, to our knowledge, it is unknown if PAO directly affects the development or progression of osteoarthritis in patients with hip dysplasia.\nContext 2: Preoperatively, the mean thickness of the acetabular cartilage was 1.38\u00b10.14 mm compared with 1.43\u00b10.07 mm 10 years postoperatively (p=0.73). The mean thickness of the femoral cartilage preoperatively was 1.37\u00b10.20 mm compared with 1.30\u00b10.07 mm 10 years postoperatively (p=0.24). Seven patients had an increase in cyst volume, six had a decrease, and four had no cysts to start with and remained without cysts. Preoperatively, the median total cyst volume per patient was 6.0 cm3 (range, 1.6-188.3 cm3) compared with 2.9 cm3 (range, 0.7-8.2 cm3) (p=0.18) at 10 years followup. At 10 years, the mean subscores for the HOOS were: pain, 79\u00b116; symptoms, 73\u00b117; activities of daily living, 85\u00b114; sport/recreation, 68\u00b122; and quality of life, 61\u00b119.\nContext 3: We investigated (1) changes of cartilage thickness in the hip after PAO; (2) how many patients had subchondral bone cysts in the acetabulum or femoral head; (3) changes in cyst volume; and (4) patients' hip function and pain after PAO.\nContext 4: Forty-eight hips in 45 patients had undergone conversion THA for a failed intertrochanteric osteotomy of the hip after a mean of 12 years (2-33 years). Mean time of follow-up was 11 years (5-15 years).\nContext 5: In this prospective study, 26 patients (22 women and four men) with hip dysplasia were enrolled with the goal of having MRI of the hip before undergoing PAO and again at 1, 2\u00bd, and 10 years after surgery. The mean age was 38 years (range, 20-60 years). The mean follow-up was 10 years (range, 5-15 years). The mean preoperative acetabular cartilage thickness was 1.38\u00b10.14 mm and the mean femoral cartilage thickness was 1.37\u00b10.20 mm. The mean preoperative cyst volume was 6.0\u00b13.0 cm3 (range, 1.6-188.3 cm3).

However, treatment outcomes of these patients vary. This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of specific metastatic sites on treatment outcomes of patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with susceptible EGFR mutations receiving first-line gefitinib, focusing on the impact of liver metastasis.\nContext 2: Between October 2009 and April 2014, patients of stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21, who received first-line gefitinib treatment, were enrolled in two hospitals and followed until December 22, 2014. The impacts of various clinical features, including sex, age, smoking history, performance status, EGFR mutation site, metastatic sites, etc., on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.\nContext 3: A total of 148 patients were eligible for analysis. Patients with liver metastasis on initial diagnosis (n=19) had shorter PFS and OS than those without liver metastasis did (median of PFS, 6.7 vs. 11.2 months, p<0.0001; median of OS, 9.2 vs. 17.5 months, p<0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed liver metastasis was an independent poor prognostic factor for PFS (HR=2.939 [95% CI: 1.729-4.997], p<0.0001) and OS (HR=3.300 [95% CI: 1.708-6.373], p=0.0004).\nContext 4: RAS mutations have been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). However, the impact of RAS mutations on response to chemotherapy remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between RAS mutations and response to preoperative chemotherapy and their impact on survival in patients undergoing curative resection of CLM.\nContext 5: The 5-year survival rate of patients with\u00a0hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was very low because of invasion and metastasis in the early stage. Biomarkers might help predict early occurrence of invasion and metastasis. Accumulating evidence has shown that the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with the prognosis of HCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of EGFR in HCC and its correlation with the prognosis of HCC.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the expression of EGFR in HCC and its correlation with the prognosis of HCC.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the expression of EGFR in HCC and its correlation with the prognosis of HCC.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of the expression of EGFR in H", "Question: Is tumor Diameter an Easy and Useful Predictor of Recurrence in Stage II Colorectal Cancer??\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nTumor diameter is an easy and useful predictor of recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.\nT", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Eighty consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis (47 males, 33 females; age, 60 +/- 9 years; range 31 to 83 years) and esophageal varices were enrolled in the study.\nContext 2: Current guidelines recommend esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in patients with cirrhosis to screen for gastroesophageal varices (GEV). Thrombocytopenia has been proposed as a noninvasive test to predict the presence of GEV. There is no agreement regarding a specific platelet count (PLT) that can reliably predict GEV. The present longitudinal study aims to (1) further investigate the relationship between varices and PLT at the time of endoscopy, (2) investigate whether changes in PLT from the baseline over time can predict the development of GEV, and (3) investigate whether changes in PLT correlate with the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). A secondary analysis was conducted for 213 subjects with compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension but without GEV enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of a nonselective beta-blocker used to prevent GEV. PLTs were obtained every 3 months, and HVPG measurements and EGD were done annually. The PLTs were compared between subjects who did and did not develop GEV. In a median follow-up of 54.9 months, 84 patients developed GEV. PLT was greater than 150,000 in 15% of patients at the development of GEV. A receiver operating curve did not show any PLT with high sensitivity or specificity for the presence of GEV. Subjects with clinically insignificant portal hypertension (HVPG < 10 mm Hg) whose PLT remained greater than 100,000 had a 2-fold reduction in the occurrence of GEV (P = 0.0374). A significant correlation was found between HVPG and PLT at the baseline, year 1, and year 5 (P < 0.0001).\nContext 3: Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication of cirrhosis, but its pathogenesis is unclear. We tested the hypotheses that PVT is the result of platelet hyperactivity or intestinal barrier disruption.\nContext 4: To evaluate the main platelet volume (MPV) as a severity marker in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).\nContext 5: To evaluate the relationship between platelet count and the severity of liver disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).\nContext 6: To evaluate the relationship between platelet count and the severity of liver disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).\nContext 7: To evaluate the relationship between platelet count and the severity of liver disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).\nContext 8: To evaluate the relationship between platelet count and the severity of liver disease in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).\nContext 9: To evaluate the relationship between platelet count and the severity of liver disease in patients with primary biliary", "Question: Is vitamin K2 administration associated with decreased disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis??\nExplanation: Vitamin K2 may preserve bone strength and reduce fracture risk. In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial among healthy postmenopausal Norwegian women, 1 year supplementation of vitamin K2 in the form of Natto capsules had no effect on bone loss rates. The main findings were: (1) markedly reduced BMD Z-scores at the lumbar spine (median -2.1, range -4.4 to -0.8), proximal femur (median -1.3, range -2.2 to -0.7) and, whole body (median -1.0, range -", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This study assessed the diagnostic performance and prognostic properties of C-reactive protein (CRP), copeptin and cortisol in individuals with sickle cell anaemia (SCA).\nContext 2: Sixty consecutive SCA subjects (18-40 years) comprising 30 subjects in the steady state and 30 subjects in vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) were recruited into this study. Thirty (30) apparently healthy individuals with HbAA genotype served as controls. ELISA was used for the determination of serum levels of copeptin, CRP and cortisol. Data obtained were statistically analyzed using the Student's t-test and Mann Whitney U as appropriate and P<0.05 was considered significant.\nContext 3: SCA subjects in VOC had significantly lower copeptin level and significantly higher CRP level compared with controls. However, serum levels of copeptin, cortisol and CRP were significantly higher in SCA subjects in VOC compared with SCA subjects in steady state. Furthermore, CRP had the widest Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) than copeptin and cortisol. No significant difference was observed in the levels of copeptin, CRP and cortisol when SCA subjects in VOC who were hospitalized for less \u2264 5 days were compared with subjects who had longer stays.\nContext 4: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity has been suggested to modulate the clinical severity of sickle cell anemia (SCA) by increasing the risk for vaso-occlusive events. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to improve ANS activity and health status in several cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Whether regular PA improves the health status of SCA patients remains unknown.\nContext 5: The FSR in T lymphocytes was 13.6+/-0.9%/24 h as a mean value (+/-SD) of the first determination in 4 groups. There was no significant difference in FSR from the baseline value immediately after the cortisol infusion (group 1: 13.3+/-1.4%/24 h vs 13.5+/-2.8%/24 h) or 24 h after the start of the infusion (group 2: 13.6+/-0.7%/24 h vs 12.3+/-2.4%/24 h).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\n1.

Experimental studies suggest that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) from marine oils may reduce breast cancer risk, however, findings are equivocal. Thus, in this study, novel transgenic mouse models were employed to provide, for the first time, direct evidence for an anti-cancer role of n-3 PUFA in mammary tumorigenesis.\nContext 2: fat-1 Mice, which are capable of endogenous n-3 PUFA synthesis, were bred with mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-neu(ndl)-YD5 mice, an aggressive breast cancer model. The resultant offspring, including novel hybrid progeny, were assessed for tumor onset, size and multiplicity as well as n-3 PUFA composition in mammary gland and tumor tissue. A complementary group of MMTV-neu(ndl)-YD5 mice were fed n-3 PUFA in the diet.\nContext 3: Epidemiological cohort studies reported an association between a high saturated to monounsaturated fatty acid ratio measured in blood lipids, indicating low stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, and decreased breast cancer risk. The suppression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression reduces cancer cell proliferation and in-vitro invasiveness, and dramatically impairs tumor formation and growth. These effects could not be overcome by supplying exogenous monounsaturated fatty acids.\nContext 4: The role of endogenous SST and CORT in carcinogen-induced MGT was investigated under normal (lean) and obesity conditions. To that end, SST- and CORT-knockout (KO) mice and their respective littermate-controls, fed low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diets, were treated with 7,12-dimethyl-benza-anthracene (DMBA) once a week (wk) for 3 wk, and MGT was monitored for 25 wk. Additionally, we examined the effect of SST or CORT removal in the development of the mammary gland.\nContext 5: The short-chain fatty acid butyrate inhibits growth of colorectal carcinoma cells in vitro. Mevalonate, a short-chain fatty acid structurally and metabolically related to butyrate, is important in signal transduction and cell proliferation. We investigated the effect of mevalonate on the growth of human colorectal carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.\nContext 6: The role of the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the development of mammary tumors was investigated in mice lacking GR expression. Mice lacking GR expression were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 wk, and mammary tumors were monitored for 12 wk.

Adiponectin is linked to central obesity and ADIPOQ variants are promising markers for understanding the genetic base of obesity-related disorders. We performed analyses of adiponectin concentrations and ADIPOQ variants and tested their associations with obesity and MetS in young subjects of Croatian origin.\nContext 4: The objective of the study was to investigate our hypothesis that common polymorphisms of the IL-1 system, which are associated with IL-1 activity, also are associated with fat mass. DESIGN, SETTING, AND STUDY SUBJECTS: The Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants (GOOD) study is a population-based cross-sectional study of 18- to 20-yr-old men (n = 1068), mostly Caucasian, from the Gothenburg area (Sweden). Three different polymorphisms, IL-1beta +3953 C/T, IL-1beta-31 T/C, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) variable number tandem repeat of 86 bp, were investigated in relation to body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and fat-free mass. RESULTS: The IL-1beta +3953 C/T polymorphism was associated with higher BMI (p = 0.02) and fat mass (p = 0.03) in the entire sample. The IL-1beta-31 T/C polymorphism was associated with lower BMI (p = 0.02) and fat mass (p = 0.03) in the entire sample. The IL-1RN variable number tandem repeat of 86 bp was not associated with any of the studied traits.

We aim to examine the relationship between psychological distress and response to proton pump inhibitors (PPI). We hypothesized that psychological distress would be associated with treatment failure in patients with GERD. We also hypothesized that psychological distress would be associated with a higher risk of adverse events in patients with GERD. We enrolled 1,000 patients with GERD who were treated with PPIs. We assessed the severity of GER using a validated scale of videoesophagography. We measured psychological distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).", "No, inappropriate ICD shocks do not induce pro-arrhythmic electrocardiographic changes in men.\nExplanation: The context 1 is a study of the effects of multiple inappropriate ICD shocks on the electrocardiogram.

The context 5 is a study of the mortality of men who receive", "Contexts:\nContext 1: There are several important interactions between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and hormonal contraception that need to be carefully considered by women with epilepsy (WWE) and their practitioners. Many AEDs induce hepatic enzymes and decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraception. In addition, estrogen-containing hormonal contraception can increase the metabolism of lamotrigine, the most commonly prescribed AED in women of childbearing age. The intrauterine device (IUD) is a highly effective form of reversible contraception without AED drug interactions that is considered by many to be the contraceptive of choice for WWE. Women with epilepsy not planning pregnancy require effective contraceptive counseling that should include discussion of an IUD. There are no guidelines, however, on who should deliver these recommendations. The objective of this study was to explore the hypothesis that contraceptive counseling by a neurologist can influence the contraceptive choices of WWE. In particular, we explored the relationship between contraceptive counseling in the epilepsy clinic and the likelihood that patients would obtain an IUD.\nContext 2: Three hundred and ninety-seven women met criteria for inclusion. Only 35% of female patients were counseled about contraception at the first visit. If women were not counseled at the first visit, they were unlikely to be counseled at subsequent visits; only 37% had ever received counseling by their fourth visit. Of the 95 patients who completed 4 visits, 28.4% were counseled about an IUD as an optimal contraceptive choice, 38.9% were generally counseled about contraceptive interactions, and 32.6% were not counseled about contraception. Women with epilepsy who received IUD-specific counseling were significantly more likely to switch to an IUD (44.4%) compared with women who received no contraceptive counseling (6.5%; p=0.0009). Women with epilepsy who received IUD-specific counseling also tended to switch to an IUD more often than those women receiving general counseling about AEDs and contraceptive interactions (18.9%; p=0.027). There was no significant difference in the likelihood of acquiring an IUD between the general counseling and no counseling groups.\nContext 3: We conducted a retrospective chart review of female patients age 18-45 seen at our institution for an initial visit between 2010 and 2014 to ascertain the type of contraceptive counseling each patient received as well as AED use and contraceptive methods. Patients who were pregnant or planning pregnancy at the first visit were excluded. Of the 397 patients who met inclusion criteria, 35% were counseled about contraception at the first visit. If women were not counseled at the first visit, they were unlikely to be counseled at subsequent visits; only 37% had ever received counseling by their fourth visit. Of the 95 patients who completed 4 visits, 28.4% were counseled about an IUD as an optimal contraceptive choice, 38.9% were generally counseled about contraceptive interactions, and 32.6% were not counseled about contraception.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only established medical agent used to dissolve gallstones. In investigating novel therapeutics for CG, we assessed the preventive effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) on the formation of CG induced by feeding a lithogenic diet (LD) containing high cholesterol levels to mice.\nContext 2: Mice were divided into the following six groups: (A) regular diet (RD); (B) RD+n-3PUFA; (C) LD; (D) LD+n-3PUFA; (E) LD+UDCA; (F) LD+n-3PUFA+UDCA. After RD/LD feeding for 2\u2009weeks, n-3PUFA or UDCA was administered orally and the diet maintained for 8\u2009weeks. The levels of phospholipids and cholesterol in bile, CG formation, gallbladder wall thickness, MUC gene expression in gallbladder were analyzed.\nContext 3: The relative proportions of the major arachidonic acid-rich phosphatidylcholine species, PC 16:0-20:4 and PC 18:0-20:4, increased significantly during octreotide treatment. These changes were associated with a rise in the cholesterol saturation index and a non-significant twofold increase in mucin glycoprotein concentration. There were significant correlations between PC 16:0-20:4 and the cholesterol saturation index, percentage of vesicular cholesterol and percentage of deoxycholic acid in gall-bladder bile.\nContext 4: No differences were observed in biliary cholesterol content or secretion between wild-type and Npc2.Tg mice fed the chow or lithogenic diets. Interestingly, Npc2.Tg mice showed an increased susceptibility to the lithogenic diet, developing more cholesterol gallstones at early times, but did not show differences in the bile acid hydrophobicity and gallbladder cholesterol saturation indices compared to wild-type mice. Finally, recombinant NPC2 decreased nucleation time in model bile.\nContext 5: Four main disturbances have been attributed to cholesterol gallstone disease: hypersecretion of cholesterol from the liver with cholesterol supersaturation in bile; disturbed motility with defective absorption and secretion by the gallbladder; increased crystallisation of cholesterol in the gallbladder wall; and increased cholesterol saturation of the bile. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the NPC2 gene on the formation of cholesterol gallstones in mice.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the NPC2 gene on the formation of cholesterol gallstones in mice.

Butyrate is a major end product of fermentation of dietary fibres and is associated with beneficial effects on colonic health. Earlier in-vitro and animal studies showed that butyrate modulates MUC2 and TFF3 expression and mucin secretion, although data from human studies are not yet available.\nContext 2: The butyrate intervention did not significantly modulate the expression of MUC2 (fold change: 1.04 and 1.05 in healthy volunteers and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively) or TFF3 (fold change: 0.91 and 0.94 in healthy volunteers and UC patients, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of sialomucins, mucus secretion and secretory IgA concentrations were not affected by the butyrate intervention in both the groups.\nContext 3: Sixteen healthy volunteers and 35 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in clinical remission self-administered a 60 ml rectal enema containing 100 mmol/l butyrate or placebo once daily for 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. After each treatment, biopsies were taken from the distal sigmoid for quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis of MUC2 and TFF3. In addition, mucosal sections were stained with high iron diamine-alcian blue to distinguish between sialomucins and sulphomucins. To analyse total mucin secretion and secretory IgA concentrations, 24 h faeces were collected during the day before the endoscopic examination.\nContext 4: Increased faecal butyrate levels have been reported in irritable bowel syndrome. Rectal instillation of sodium butyrate (NaB) increases visceral sensitivity in rats by an unknown mechanism. We seek to examine the signal transduction pathways responsible for the enhanced neuronal excitability in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following NaB enemas and demonstrate that this is responsible for the colonic hypersensitivity reported in this animal model.\nContext 5: A SCFA mixture (75 mM acetate, 35 mM propionate and 20 mM butyrate) or individual SCFAs (130 mM) was administered to healthy volunteers in a crossover study.

The mechanism of this association is not clear. The most likely explanation is that anemia is a marker of underlying disease, such as cancer, which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. Anemia is also a marker of chronic disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. Anemia is also a marker of chronic disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. Anemia is also a marker of chronic disease, such as chronic", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been demonstrated to increase pulmonary capillary permeability as judged by the increased flow of protein-rich lymph from the lungs of sheep infused with LPS. This finding suggests that LPS-injured pulmonary capillaries might be less restrictive than uninjured capillaries to the filtration of large hetastarch molecules. Hetastarch has a broad molecular mass spectrum (35-1,500 kilodaltons (kDa)), and one way to test the restrictiveness of pulmonary capillaries is to measure the size of the largest hetastarch molecules that cross the microvascular barrier and enter the lymph. To evaluate the effects of LPS, we compared hetastarch molecular distributions in the lung lymph of normal and LPS-injured sheep.\nContext 2: Adult sheep (38.2 +/- 0.8 kg) were surgically prepared for the collection of lung lymph, with study initiation after a 5- to 7-day recovery period. Hetastarch (6%) was infused (10 mL/kg) 24 hours before study to allow for stabilization of the hetastarch molecular distribution. On the day of study, LPS (Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 2 microg/kg; n = 6) was infused, and plasma and lymph samples were collected for 12 hours. An additional group of animals not infused with LPS (n = 6) served as controls. Hetastarch molecular distributions in plasma and lymph were measured by using high performance size exclusion chromatography.\nContext 3: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, a protective mechanism, minimizes perfusion of underventilated lung areas to reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching. We studied the effects of sepsis on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and attempted to determine whether hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is influenced by pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate, a nitric oxide scavenger.\nContext 4: In control sheep, the largest hetastarch molecules in lymph averaged 861 +/- 18 kDa (mean +/- SEM) (plasma, 1,065 +/- 18 kDa). In LPS-treated sheep, the largest hetastarch molecules in lymph averaged 845 +/- 19 kDa (not significant vs. normal) (plasma, 1,025 +/- 14 kDa). Hetastarch concentrations in plasma and lung lymph of normal sheep were 0.5 +/- 0.1 and 0.4 +/- 0.1 g/L, respectively. In LPS-treated sheep, the hetastarch concentration in plasma was 0.4 +/- 0.1 g/L, and the hetastarch concentration in lung lymph was 0.3 +/- 0.1 g/L. The hetastarch molecular distribution in plasma and lymph was not significantly different between normal and LPS-treated sheep.\nContext 5: The largest hetastarch molecules in plasma and lymph of normal sheep averaged 1,065 +/- 18 and 1,025 +/- 14 kDa, respectively. The largest hetastarch molecules in plasma and lymph of LPS-treated sheep averaged", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Thirteen participants with myofascial pain and MTrP in the upper trapezius muscle and 12 asymptomatic individuals participated. High-density surface EMG was recorded from the upper trapezius muscle using a matrix of 64 surface electrodes aligned with an anatomic landmark system (ALS). Each participant performed a shoulder elevation task consisting of a series of 30 s ramped contractions to 15% or 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force. Topographical maps of the EMG average rectified value were computed and the peak EMG amplitude during the ramped contractions was identified and its location determined with respect to the ALS. The location of the MTrP was also determined relative to the ALS and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationship between MTrP and peak EMG amplitude location.\nContext 2: To apply topographical mapping of the electromyography (EMG) amplitude recorded from the upper trapezius muscle to evaluate the distribution of activity and the location of peak activity during a shoulder elevation task in participants with and without myofascial pain and myofascial trigger points (MTrP) and compare this location with the site of the MTrP.\nContext 3: Fourteen healthy subjects underwent comparison of CSPs while contracting the target muscle at different levels ranging from 10% to 50% of the maximum force, which was continuously monitored with a force transducer. Rectified surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings were obtained from abductor pollicis brevis muscle following ipsilateral recurrent noxious digit 2 and digit 5 stimulation.\nContext 4: The location of the peak EMG amplitude was significantly (P<0.05) different between groups (participants with pain/MTrP: -0.32\u00b11.2 cm at 15% MVC and -0.35\u00b10.9 cm at 60% MVC relative to the ALS; asymptomatic participants: 1.0\u00b11.3 cm at 15% MVC and 1.3\u00b11.1 cm relative to the ALS). However, no correlation was observed between the position of the MTrP and peak EMG amplitude during the ramped contractions at either force level (15%: rs=0.039, P=0.9; 60%: rs=-0.087, P=0.778).\nContext 5: Group average CSP onset and offset latencies were significantly (P<0.05) different between groups (participants with pain/MTrP: 0.32\u00b10.1 ms at 15% MVC and 0.33\u00b10.1 ms at 60% MVC relative to the ALS; asymptomatic participants: 0.35\u00b10.1 ms at 15% MVC and 0.36\u00b10.1 ms relative to the ALS). However, no correlation was observed between the position of the MTrP and CSP onset and offset latencies during the ramped contractions at either force level (15%: rs=0.039, P=0.9; 60%: rs=-0.087, P=0", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation, has been used to prevent allograft rejection. We investigated whether MMF also limits progressive renal injury in rats with 5/6 renal ablation, a model not primarily related to immunologic mechanisms.\nContext 2: Interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration is a feature of experimental models of salt-sensitive hypertension (SSHTN). Since several products of these cells are capable of modifying local vascular reactivity and sodium reabsorption, we investigated whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a drug known to inhibit infiltration and proliferation of immune cells, would modify the SSHTN induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion.\nContext 3: Tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil rescue therapy (plus anti-rejection treatment in six recipients with additional signs of acute cellular rejection) failed to prevent progressive deterioration of graft function. Four patients returned to dialysis after 4 to 18 months. Serial post-transplant serology detected HLA class I and/or II reactivity in seven recipients. Tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil therapy did not affect the time course of alloantibody levels. One patient with C4d-positive transplant glomerulopathy, who did not respond to tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil rescue therapy, developed nephrotic-range proteinuria associated with a rapid decline of allograft function. Despite considerable reduction in alloantibody levels and nearly complete clearance of C4d deposits, immunoadsorption failed to prevent graft failure in this patient.\nContext 4: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Proton pump inhibitors impair exposure to MPA due to incomplete conversion from MMF. Lower exposure to MPA could result in an increased risk of acute rejection. We investigated whether MMF-treated renal transplant patients who concomitantly used pantoprazole as ulcer prophylaxis had a higher risk of acute rejection within the first three months after transplantation than those who used ranitidine.\nContext 5: GM caused a marked reduction in renal functions and increased oxidative stress parameters. Histopathological examination revealed tubular necrosis especially in the renal cortex in GM rats. On immunohistochemical evaluation, GM rat showed more intense expressions of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) than control rats. In addition, GM rats showed more intense expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) than control rats. In addition, GM rats showed more intense expressions of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) than control rats.

The study was conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase, 100 patients with H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to receive either a 7-day triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg) or a 7-day standard regimen (omeprazole 20 mg, amoxicillin 1", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Permanent hypoparathyroidism has become the most common and the most severe complication after thyroid surgery. In our experience, some patients suffer from permanent hypocalcemia and related symptoms despite normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) values after thyroid surgery. The aim of this work was to present a series of such patients with long-term hypocalcemia and normal PTH values to evaluate to what extent parathyroid function was impaired by thyroidectomy, and determine whether irregularities of bone and calcium metabolism were associated with this phenomenon.\nContext 2: A retrospective review of medical records was performed in 368 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy and 96 patients undergoing thyroidectomy by a single surgeon. We evaluated changes in serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and BP before and 6 months after surgery.\nContext 3: We have previously found decreased serum levels of both ionized calcium and 1,25(OH)2D and an increase in serum phosphate levels at 1 year after hemithyroidectomy. However, basal and stimulated parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretions were not altered. To investigate whether the observed biochemical changes after unilateral thyroid surgery may be due to a relative end-organ resistance to PTH, we studied the peripheral effects of infused hPTH-(1-34) in 6 patients preoperatively and 3 months after hemithyroidectomy.\nContext 4: From September 1, 2001 to October 31, 2002, 88 parathyroidectomies were performed. iPTH and TSC were measured at the start of the operation, and at 5 and 10 min after gland removal. Data were compared, and trends were analyzed with respect to removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue as confirmed by pathology. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine if decreases in TSC were significant.\nContext 5: Of 170 patients with primary intervention, 164 (96.5%) were normocalcemic after operation. Six of 170 patients (3.5%) underwent early reexploration. Three additional patients underwent late secondary procedures. These nine secondary operations were successful in seven patients (78%). At follow-up (mean, 24.7 months after operation) normocalcemia was noted in 163 of 171 patients (95.3%). Persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism occurred in 1.2% and 3.5% of patients, respectively. Permanent postoperative hypocalcemia was noted in 1.2% of patients. The mean serum calcium level was 9.2 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dL at the time of reexploration. The mean serum calcium level was 9.2 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dL at the time of reexploration.

Central venous catheter infections (CVCI) are frequent and an independent predictor of intestinal failure associated liver disease. A common complication in children with long-term CVC is the risk of line breakage. Given the often-limited usable vascular access sites in this population, it has been the standard of practice to perform repair of the broken line. Although widely practiced, it is unknown if this practice is associated with increased line colonization rates and subsequent line loss.\nContext 2: A retrospective review of our institutional IF population over the past 8years (2006-2014) was performed. Utilizing a prospectively constructed database, all pediatric patients (n=13, ages 0-17 years) with CVC dependency enrolled in the Children's Intestinal Rehabilitation Program with IF were included who underwent a repair and/or replacement procedure of their line. The control replacement group was CVCs that were replaced without being repaired (36), the experimental repair group was CVCs that were repaired (8). The primary outcome of interest was the mean number of days in each group from the intervention (replacement or repair) to line infection/colonization. Mann-Whitney tests for significance were performed with p-values <0.05 being the threshold value for significance.\nContext 3: To determine the effect of routine intravenous (IV) administration set changes on central venous catheter (CVC) colonization and catheter-related bacteremia.\nContext 4: In total, 192 PORTs were inserted in 179 children. There were 43 CAIs (22%), and the infection rate was 0.35 per 1000 catheter-days. The CAI rate (15%) in children who had severe neutropenia on the day of the procedure did not differ statistically from the CAI rate (24%) in children who did not have severe neutropenia (P =.137). Conversely, patients with severe neutropenia who had a CAI were more likely to have their PORT removed (P =.019). The most common organisms to cause catheter removal were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with high-risk ALL had a statistically significant higher incidence of late CAI than patients with standard-risk ALL (P =.012). Age (P =.272), positive blood culture (P =.001), and the presence of a central venous catheter (P =.001) were not associated with late CAI.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of central venous catheter (CVC) colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) in children with cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The study was conducted at a single institution from 2006 to 2014. A retrospective review of the medical records of all children with cancer who received chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and had a CVC inserted was performed. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of CRBSI. The secondary outcome of interest was the incidence of CVC colonization.

The expression of TGF-\u03b21 was positively correlated with that of Fascin1. After 24 and 48h of treatment with TGF-\u03b21 (10ng/mL), the invasive and metastatic abilities of the 786-0 cells in the NT and si-NC groups were higher than those before the treatment (P<0.05). Comparing the three groups before TGF-\u03b21 treatment, the invasive and metastatic ability of 786-0 cells in the si-Fascin1 were significantly lower than those in the NT group and si-NC group (P<0.05).\nContext 3: Renal tissue slices of 52 cases when undergoing radical nephrectomy were collected to be the observation group, and the normal renal tissues of 23 cases when undergoing nephrectomy due to trauma were collected to be the control group. The expressions of TGF-\u03b21 and Fascin1 were measured by immunohistochemical staining. Human renal carcinoma 786-0 cell line was selected as the study subject. The cells were divided into six groups including NT (no transfection), si-NC (transfection with pGenesil-1-con) si-Fascin1 (transfection with pGen-1-FSCN1) groups, and three corresponding groups: NT, si-NC and si-Fascin1 groups treated with TGF-\u03b21. RT-qPCR, Western-Blot, Transwell, and flow cytometry method were used in this study.\nContext 4: Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is a hallmark in end-stage renal disease. The importance of TGF-beta1-induced changes in protease activity in this process is not fully elucidated. TGF-beta1 up-regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), which lowers matrix degradation. Our aim was to investigate the importance of PAI-1 in TGF-beta1-induced kidney disease.\nContext 5: The process of metastasis requires the single tumor cell that has the ability to invade and migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to adhere to the endothelial cells of the blood vessels. The expression of Fascin1 protein in the 786-0 cells was detected by Western blotting. The expression of Fascin1 protein in the 786-0 cells was detected by Western blotting.

The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in patients with IBD. The CCND1 protein is the regulatory subunit of an enzyme that inactivates the retinoblastoma protein, a tumor suppressor protein, and promotes progression through the G1-S phase of the cell cycle. The CCND1 870G-A gene polymorphism influences susceptibility to colorectal cancer. The mutant allele of CCND1 in IBD-associated neoplasia leads to a greater frequency of alternate splicing during transcription, resulting in a more stable CCND1 protein. This creates a higher concentration of CCND1, facilitating easier passage through the G1/S checkpoint, abnormal cell cycle progression, and possibly carcinogenesis.\nContext 3: Cyclin D1 gene amplification and/or overexpression occurs in several human cancers. The level of expression of cyclin D1 protein during the multistage process of human colon carcinogenesis was determined.\nContext 4: Pathology and clinical databases were systematically searched for the presence of dysplastic lesions in inflammatory bowel disease from 1997 to 2004. Patients with UC who had adenoma-like DALMs were identified, and a subset with HGD lesions was defined as our study cohort.\nContext 5: With the use of cre/loxP technology, intestinal-specific disruption of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (Vhl), hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif)-1alpha, and aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) was generated. Colon inflammation was induced using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model, and the mice were analyzed by histologic analysis, Western blot analysis, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article and/or the context.\nYes, the CCND1 870G-A gene polymorphism influences susceptibility to colorectal cancer.

A variety of experimental paradigms have been developed to study how faces are represented and recognized, among which is the part-spacing paradigm. This paradigm is presumed to characterize the processing of both the featural and configural information of faces, and it has become increasingly popular for testing hypotheses on face specificity and in the diagnosis of face perception in cognitive disorders.\nContext 2: In two experiments we questioned the validity of the part task of this paradigm by showing that, in this task, measuring pure information about face parts is confounded by the effect of face configuration on the perception of those parts. First, we eliminated or reduced contributions from face configuration by either rearranging face parts into a non-face configuration or by removing the low spatial frequencies of face images. We found that face parts were no longer sensitive to inversion, suggesting that the previously reported inversion effect observed in the part task was due in fact to the presence of face configuration. Second, self-reported prosopagnosic patients who were selectively impaired in the holistic processing of faces failed to detect part changes when face configurations were presented. When face configurations were scrambled, however, their performance was as good as that of normal controls.\nContext 3: We used functional MRI (fMRI) to examine face selectivity of 3 core face-processing regions--fusiform face area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA), and superior temporal sulcus (STS)--in schizophrenia patients (n = 24) and healthy controls (n = 23). To disassociate face-specific processing from general perceptual processing, we compared cortical activations during performance of perceptually equated face and tree detection tasks.\nContext 4: Face perception impairment in schizophrenia has long been recognized. However, brain mechanisms underlying this socially important perceptual deficit are not well understood. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that patients have altered structure in brain regions responsible for processing face information, but functional properties of these brain regions are not clearly determined. A key functional property of the face-processing system--face selectivity--has yet to be evaluated in schizophrenia.\nContext 5: During face identification in humans, facial information is sampled (seeing) and handled (processing) in ways that are influenced by the kind of facial image type, such as a self-image or an image of another face. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these two different types of facial information are not well understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of face identification in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. We found that the neural correlates of face identification were similar in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. However, the neural correlates of face identification were different in patients with schizophrenia. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia showed greater activation in the fusiform face area (FFA) and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) than healthy subjects. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying face identification are altered in schizophrenia.\nContext 6: The present study examined the neural correlates of face identification in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia. We found that the neural correlates of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Forty-three trial participants were interviewed in early 2014. Almost all felt they had benefitted, irrespective of their change in step-count, and that primary care was an appropriate setting.Important facilitators included a desire for a healthy lifestyle, improved physical health, enjoyment of walking in the local environment, having a flexible routine allowing for an increase in walking, appropriate self and external monitoring and support from others.Important barriers included physical health problems, an inflexible routine, work and other commitments, the weather and a mistrust of the monitoring equipment.BCTs that were reported to have the most impact included: providing information about behaviour-health link; prompting self-monitoring and review of goals and outcomes; providing feedback; providing specific information about how to increase walking; planning social support/change; and relapse prevention. Rewards were unhelpful.\nContext 2: The majority of mid-life and older adults in the UK are not achieving recommended physical activity levels and inactivity is associated with many health problems. Walking is a safe, appropriate exercise. The PACE-UP trial sought to increase walking through the structured use of a pedometer and handbook, with and without support from a practice nurse trained in behaviour change techniques (BCTs). Understanding barriers and facilitators to engagement with a primary care based physical activity intervention is essential for future trials and programmes.\nContext 3: Physical activity (PA) is important for physical and mental health in adults and older adults. Interventions incorporating theory-based behaviour change techniques (BCTs) can be useful in helping people to increase their PA levels and can be delivered by practice nurses in primary care. We undertook two primary care based complex walking interventions among adults and older adults. Both interventions were underpinned by BCTs and delivered by practice nurses and we sought their views and experiences of delivering over 1400 complex PA consultations.\nContext 4: 315 patients were recruited to a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial of an intervention to promote walking in primary care. A series of repeated measures ANCOVAs were conducted to examine the effect of season on pedometer measures of walking behaviour and TPB measures, assessed immediately post-intervention and six months later. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to assess whether season moderated the prediction of intention and behaviour by TPB measures.\nContext 5: A third of the world's population does not engage in recommended levels of physical activity (PA), leading to substantial health and economic burdens. The healthcare sector offers a variety of opportunities to promote PA, but the evidence base for the effectiveness of interventions is limited. This systematic review aimed to identify and synthesise the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to promote PA in healthcare settings.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a complex intervention to promote walking in primary care. The intervention was delivered by practice nurses and was based on theory and evidence. The intervention was delivered to 315 patients in primary care. The primary outcome was change in walking behaviour. Secondary outcomes included change in intention to walk more and change in self-efficacy. The intervention was delivered in two arms: a control arm and an intervention arm. The intervention arm received a complex intervention to promote walking, delivered by practice nurses.", "#1: The results of the study showed that the expression of CD46 was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with ovarian cancer.

We show that clearance of endothelial cell apical junctions during vascular tubulogenesis depends on Rasip1, as well as the GTPase Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42 homolog) and the kinase Pak4 (serine/threonine-protein kinase 4). Genetic deletion of Rasip1 or Cdc42, or inhibition of Pak4, all blocks endothelial cell tubulogenesis. By contrast, inactivation of RhoA (Ras homologue gene family member A) signaling leads to vessel overexpansion, implicating actomyosin contractility in control of lumen diameter. Interestingly, blocking activity of NMII (nonmuscle myosin II) either before, or after, lumen morphogenesis results in dramatically different tubulogenesis phenotypes, suggesting time-dependent roles.\nContext 2: Vascular tubulogenesis is essential to cardiovascular development. Within initial vascular cords of endothelial cells, apical membranes are established and become cleared of cell-cell junctions, thereby allowing continuous central lumens to open. Rasip1 (Ras-interacting protein 1) is required for apical junction clearance, as well as for regulation of Rho GTPase (enzyme that hydrolyzes GTP) activity.

CX3CR1 mediates leukocyte migration and adhesion in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Mice lacking Cx3cr1 have altered distribution and function of DC subpopulations in some tissue microenvironments. The present study compares the distribution of monocyte-derived cells in the normal retina and uveal tract as a prelude to the investigation of the role of CX3CR1 in murine models of ocular disease.\nContext 3: EAU was induced in naive WT, Cx(3)cr1(gfp/+), and Cx(3)cr1(gfp/gfp) C57Bl/6 mice or chimeric mice. Ocular disease severity was graded by histologic analysis of resin sections. In addition, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were performed on retinal whole mounts to characterize the monocytic infiltrate and changes in retinal microglia. To determine the relative roles of resident and blood-borne monocyte-derived cells in the active phase of uveoretinitis, EAU was induced 4 weeks after transplantation in chimeric mice (Cx(3)cr1(gfp/gfp)\u2192WT and Cx(3)cr1(gfp/+)\u2192WT), and analysis was performed at days 14, 16, 21, and 28 after immunization.\nContext 4: Chemokines are small proteins that regulate different cellular functions, such as leukocyte activation, chemoattraction and inflammation. The chemokine CXCL14 (BRAK) is a highly conserved gene among species and through evolution. It has been shown that CXCL14 is locally upregulated during viral infections, also, it has been found that this chemokine possesses direct antibacterial activities. Nonetheless, the exact role that CXCL14 plays during infection remains elusive.\nContext 5: RT-PCR array screening revealed differential expression of a broad range of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes between immunized and unimmunized mice. A significant upregulation of chemokines known to attract, among other cells, eosinophils (CCL8), T cells (CXCL10), and monocytes (CXCL9) was observed in the retina of immunized mice.

The severity of GER is associated with age and serum triglyceride levels in men, and with the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in women. The severity of reflux symptoms, however, is not associated with metabolic parameters. There are more women than men with reflux symptoms but without GER ('presumed' functional heartburn group), compared with subjects with neither GER nor reflux symptoms.

Similarly, estradiol levels were not associated with the worsening of any (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01), stress, or urge incontinence in incontinent women. The change in estradiol levels from one year to the next was also not associated with the development (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-1.00) or worsening (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05) of incontinence.\nContext 3: This is a longitudinal analysis of women with incontinence in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, a multicenter, multiracial/ethnic prospective cohort study of community-dwelling women transitioning through menopause. At baseline and at each of the eight annual visits, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation elicited the frequency and type of incontinence using a self-administered questionnaire and drew a blood sample on days 2 to 5 of the menstrual cycle. All endocrine assays were performed using a double-antibody chemiluminescent immunoassay. We analyzed the data using discrete Cox survival models and generalized estimating equations with time-dependent covariates.\nContext 4: Thirty-five normal-weight (body mass index > 19 and < 25 kg/m(2)) postmenopausal women (age 54.6 +/- 3.9 years, mean +/- standard deviation) participated in the study and were divided into two groups (Group I: n = 19, time since menopause < 5 years; and Group II: n = 16, time since menopause > 5 years). Patients were treated with a continuous estradiol transdermal supplementation and 12-day courses of medroxyprogesterone acetate every 2 months.

In HIV-1 infection, Matrin 3 serves as a Rev cofactor important for the cytoplasmic accumulation of HIV-1 transcripts. ZAP is a potent host restriction factor of multiple viruses including retroviruses HIV-1 and MoMuLV. In this study we sought to further characterize Matrin 3 functions in the regulation of HIV gene expression.\nContext 2: Here we describe a function for Matrin 3 as a negative regulator of the ZAP-mediated restriction of retroviruses. Mass spectrometry analysis of Matrin 3-associated proteins uncovered interactions with proteins of the ZAP degradation complex, DDX17 and EXOSC3. Coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed Matrin 3 associations with DDX17, EXOSC3 and ZAP, in a largely RNA-dependent manner, indicating that RNA is mediating the Matrin 3 interactions with these components of the ZAP degradation complex. Silencing Matrin 3 expression caused a remarkably enhanced ZAP-driven inhibition of HIV-1 and MoMuLV luciferase reporter viruses. This effect was shared with additional nuclear matrix proteins. ZAP targets multiply-spliced HIV-1 transcripts, but in the context of Matrin 3 suppression, this ZAP restriction was broadened to unspliced and multiply-spliced RNAs.\nContext 3: Ribavirin decreased the virus load and dose-dependently inhibited the accumulation of RANTES messenger RNA in Andes-virus (ANDV)-infected human endothelial cells, but failed to suppress TNF-\u03b1-induced activation of RANTES and interleukin-6 in ANDV-inoculated cultures.

Although Daxx is encoded by a type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) interferon-stimulated gene, the requirement for Daxx in the interferon anti-retroviral response has not been elucidated. In this report, we describe the results of experiments designed to investigate the role of Daxx in the interferon anti-retroviral response.

With current ureteroscopic (URS) techniques, small tissue samples are usually the only available histopathologic material for evaluation, representing a diagnostic challenge. Precision in diagnosis is essential for treatment decision making. There has been much debate as to whether tumor grade and stage found on biopsy agree with final pathology. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether URS biopsy volume affects tumor grading and staging agreement between biopsy and nephroureterectomy (NU) specimens.\nContext 2: Of the 54 patients studied, low grade and high grade UC biopsy were found in 8 (15%) and 46 (85%), URS biopsies, respectively. Regarding biopsy stage, 51 (94%), 1 (2%), and 2 (4%) were stage Ta, T1, T2, respectively. Grade concordance was 92.6%, (95% CI: 82.4%-98.0%). Stage concordance was 43% (95% CI: 28.7%-55.9%). Multivariable analysis showed biopsy volume did not affect tumor assessment of grade (P = 0.81) or stage (P = 0.44).\nContext 3: We reviewed 137 URS biopsies in 81 patients with suspected upper urinary tract UC performed from April 2002 to April 2011. Of those, 54 patients had both the URS biopsy and NU performed at our institution and were available for review. Biopsy dimensions were recorded to calculate estimated ellipsoid volume, and 2 urological pathologists independently evaluated histologic grade (ISUP/WHO 2004), (based on pleomorphism and mitosis) and depth of invasion. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate URS biopsy and NU specimen grade and stage concordance. In addition, univariable and multivariable analyses was performed to assess the effect of biopsy volume on agreement.\nContext 4: The prognostic significance of renal pelvis vs ureteral upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma tumor location is controversial.

Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy on muscle mass and muscle atrophy.\nContext 2: We investigated the preventive effects and underlying mechanisms of genistein on muscle atrophy.\nContext 3: In Expt. 1, male Wistar rats were fed a diet containing no genistein [control (CON)] or 0.05% genistein (GEN; wt:wt diet) for 24 d. On day 14, the sciatic nerve in the left hind leg was severed, and the right hind leg was sham-treated. In Expt. 2, male C57BL6J mice were subcutaneously administered a vehicle (Veh group) or the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI group) via an osmotic pump for 27 d, and each group was subsequently fed CON or GEN diets from day 3 to day 27. Muscle atrophy was induced on day 17 as in Expt. 1. In Expt. 3, male C57BL6J mice were subcutaneously administered vehicle or a selective ER agonist-ER-\u03b1 [4,4',4'-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT)] or ER-\u03b2 [2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN)]-or genistein (GEN-sc-i) via an osmotic pump for 13 d, and muscle atrophy was induced on day 3 as in Expt. 1. The ratio of denervated soleus muscle weight to sham-operated soleus muscle weight (d/s ratio) was used as the index of muscle atrophy.\nContext 4: We investigated the effect of genistein treatment (300 mg genisten/kg body weight/day), or exercise training, or combined genistein and exercise training, for a period of 6 weeks on physical characteristics, cardiovascular plasma markers, blood pressure, aortic morphology, cardiac structure and oxidative stress in the ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rat. Comparisons were made with intact rats.\nContext 5: There are conflicting data in the literature whether estrogens affect muscle strength.

The incidence of aGvHD grade 0-IV was 69.2%, 5.1%, 17.9%, 2.5%, 2.5% in the palifermin group and 61.5%, 12.8%, 12.8%, 10.2%, 5.2% in the control group, respectively (p>0.4 for each). The incidence of limited and extensive cGvHD was 17.9% and 23% in the palifermin versus 25.6% and 28.2% in the control group (p=0.32 and p=0.50, respectively). The estimated 3-year OS did not differ significantly between studied groups. We did not observe any secondary malignancies in these patients.\nContext 3: Palifermin is known as the effective growth factor to reduce the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis (OM) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, additional data on the long-term safety of palifermin and its potential influence on graft versus host disease (GvHD) are needed.\nContext 4: Categorized by the median of cell doses infused, no G-PBMC cell dose significantly correlated with neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 24.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.9-33.3) and was not significantly influenced by evaluated G-PBMC cell doses. With a median follow-up time of 18 months for surviving patients, estimates for extensive chronic GVHD was 43.8% (95% CI: 31.4-56.2), for freedom from progression was 69.5% (95% CI: 58.1-79.9) and for overall survival was 78.6% (95% CI: 70.1-86.9).\nContext 5: The incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was 24.6% (95% CI: 15.9-33.3) and was not significantly influenced by evaluated G-PBMC cell doses.

Following the final self-administration session, rats were injected with CocH vector or a control injection (empty vector or saline), and their cocaine solutions were replaced with saline for 14 days to allow for extinction of lever pressing. Subsequently, they were tested for drug-primed reinstatement by administering intraperitoneal injections of saline (S), cocaine (C) (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg), and d-amphetamine according to the following sequence: S, C, S, C, S, C, S, d-amphetamine. Rats then received cocaine-priming injections once weekly for 4 weeks and, subsequently, once monthly for up to 6 months.\nContext 3: Cocaine dependence is a pervasive disorder with high rates of relapse. In a previous study, direct administration of a quadruple mutant albumin-fused butyrylcholinesterase that efficiently catalyzes hydrolysis of cocaine to benzoic acid and ecgonine methyl ester acutely blocked cocaine seeking in an animal model of relapse. In the present experiments, these results were extended to achieve a long-duration blockade of cocaine seeking with a gene transfer paradigm using a related butyrylcholinesterase-based cocaine hydrolase (CocH).\nContext 4: Gpr3-/- mice exhibited higher rewarding responses in the CPP paradigm. Gpr3-/- mice self-administered more cocaine, especially during the first days of training. No differences were found between genotypes regarding behavioural sensitization and the maximal effort required to obtain a cocaine infusion. Non-contingent priming injections of cocaine before operant training eliminated enhanced cocaine self-administration in Gpr3-/- mice. Extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens induced by cocaine did not differ between genotypes.\nContext 5: Cocaine abuse continues to be a significant public health problem associated with morbidity and mortality. To date, no pharmacotherapeutic approach has proven effective for treating cocaine use disorders. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that noradrenergic and serotonergic systems play a role in cocaine addiction. The present study examined the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram on cocaine self-administration in rats. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement for 14 days. Following the final self-administration session, rats were injected with citalopram (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and their cocaine solutions were replaced with saline for 14 days to allow for extinction of lever pressing. Subsequently, they were tested for drug-primed reinstatement by administering intraperitoneal injections of saline (S), cocaine (C) (5, 10,", "Yes, duration of breastfeeding and gender are associated with methylation of the LEPTIN gene in very young children.\nExplanation: Duration of breastfeeding was negatively associated with LEP methylation.

Severe preeclampsia developed in 22, for an incidence of 2.5%. As expected, women with severe preeclampsia had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and their infants had lower birth weights. Placental weights at delivery were similar between those with severe preeclampsia and control subjects (659 vs 699 g; P =.51). During the third trimester, the median placenta growth factor concentrations were significantly lower in women with severe preeclampsia than in normotensive control subjects (125 vs 449 pg/mL; P =.003). When samples drawn at <20 weeks' gestation were compared, there was no difference between the group with severe preeclampsia and those who remained normotensive (98.8 vs 56.34 pg/mL; P =.15).\nContext 4: Although they were within the normotensive range, all blood pressure measurements considered were significantly higher in pregnant women with congenital uterine malformations, compared to normal pregnant women. Namely, 24-hr, daytime, and nighttime systolic (mean +/- SD) were 121.1 +/- 8.4, 124.4 +/- 8.8, 114.0 +/- 7.7 mmHg, respectively, in women with uterine malformations and 108.0 +/- 7.4, 109.2 +/- 7.3, 102.1 +/- 8.5 mmHg, respectively, in normal pregnant women.

Fifteen of the fetuses from women with uterine malformations had a birth weight <2500 g, compared to 3 of 10 fetuses from normal pregnant women (p < 0.001). The mean birth weight of the fetuses from women with uterine malformations was 2490 +/- 500 g, compared to 3000 +/- 500 g in the fetuses from normal pregnant women (p < 0.001).\nContext 5: The mean blood pressure of the women with uterine malformations was significantly higher than that of the normal pregnant women.

However, neither meperidine nor alfentanil reduced the gain of shivering, as determined by either oxygen consumption or electromyography. Opioid administration also failed to significantly decrease the maximum intensity of shivering.\nContext 2: Thermoregulatory shivering can be characterized by its threshold (triggering core temperature), gain (incremental intensity increase with further core temperature deviation), and maximum intensity. Meperidine (a combined mu- and kappa-agonist) treats shivering better than equianalgesic doses of pure mu-opioid agonists. Meperidine's special antishivering action is mediated, at least in part, by a disproportionate decrease in the shivering threshold. That is, meperidine decreases the shivering threshold twice as much as the vasoconstriction threshold, whereas alfentanil (a pure mu-agonist) decreases the vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds comparably. However, reductions in the gain or maximum shivering intensity might also contribute to the clinical efficacy of meperidine. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that meperidine reduces the gain and maximum intensity of shivering much more than alfentanil does.\nContext 3: Ten volunteers were each studied on three separate days: (1) control (no drug); (2) a target total plasma meperidine concentration of 1.2 microg/ml; and (3) a target plasma alfentanil concentration of 0.2 microg/ml. Skin temperatures were maintained near 31 degrees C, and core temperatures were decreased by central-venous infusion of cold lactated Ringer's solution until maximum shivering intensity was observed. Shivering was evaluated using oxygen consumption and electromyography. A sustained increase in oxygen consumption identified the shivering threshold. The gain of shivering was calculated as the slope of the oxygen consumption versus core temperature regression, and as the slope of electromyographic intensity versus core temperature regression.\nContext 4: To investigate the effect of 0.2 mg x kg(-1), 0.3 mg x kg(-1) and 0.4 mg x kg(-1) urapidil on the incidence and severity of postanesthetic shivering.\nContext 5: Ondansetron, a serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, reduces postoperative shivering. Drugs that reduce shivering usually impair central thermoregulation.

Patients underwent 3T MR spectroscopy, including a PRESS (n=55) and MEGA-PRESS (n=43) sequence, to estimate occipital glutamate and GABA concentrations, respectively. The association was calculated between neurotransmitter concentrations and central information processing speed, which was measured using the Computerized Visual Searching Task (CVST) and compared between the different risk categories.\nContext 2: As epileptogenic insult, a status epilepticus (SE) was induced in rats by lithium pilocarpine. Rats were subjected to (11)C-PK11195 PET scans before SE; at 4 h after SE; at 1, 2, 5, 7, 14, and 22 d after SE; and at 14-16 wk after SE. For data evaluation, brain regions were outlined by coregistration with a standard rat brain atlas, and percentage injected dose/cm(3) and binding potential (simplified reference tissue model with cerebellar gray matter as a reference region) were calculated. For autoradiography and immunohistochemical evaluation, additional rats were decapitated without prior SE or 2, 5, or 14 d after SE.\nContext 3: Most patients who are resistant to the first antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment are also resistant to a treatment with a second or third AED, indicating that patients who have an inadequate response to initial treatment with AEDs are likely to have refractory epilepsy. Animal models of refractory epilepsy are important tools to study mechanisms of AED resistance and develop new treatment strategies for counteracting resistance. We have recently described a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in which spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) develop after a status epilepticus induced by sustained electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala. Prolonged treatment of epileptic rats with phenobarbital (PB) resulted in two subgroups, PB responders and PB nonresponders.\nContext 4: In children with tuberous sclerosis, the PET tracer alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) has been shown to be selectively taken up by epileptogenic tubers, thus allowing differentiation of tubers from normal brain.

However, there are questions about the effect of withdrawing immunomodulator therapy from these patients. We studied the effects of treatment with infliximab and immunomodulators (co-treatment) and then immunomodulator withdrawal on long-term outcomes of patients, as well as trough levels of infliximab and formation of anti-infliximab antibodies (ATI).\nContext 2: In a retrospective study with the median follow-up period of 34 months (interquartile range, 19-58 months), we analyzed data from 223 patients treated for Crohn's disease between May 1999 and December 2010 at the University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium (65 received infliximab monotherapy, 158 received infliximab and an immunomodulator). Trough levels of infliximab and levels of ATI were measured in blood samples collected from 117 patients throughout co-treatment, as well as the time of immunomodulator withdrawal and after withdrawal.\nContext 3: A total of 74 patients with Crohn's disease, including 50 males and 24 females with mean age of 27 years, receiving infliximab therapy from January 2011 to June 2015 were retrospectively included. Clinical variables including routine blood test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and Crohn's disease activity index were measured before treatment and after 3rd, 6th treatments.\nContext 4: Infliximab is effective treatment for Crohn's disease and has been associated with rare, but serious infectious complications. Emerging data suggest a benefit of infliximab in preventing postoperative Crohn's disease recurrence. It is not known whether administration of infliximab shortly after resective surgery for Crohn's disease increases postoperative complications.\nContext 5: A previous randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that infliximab maintenance therapy prevented recurrence of Crohn's disease 1 year after an ileocolonic resection. We evaluated recurrence of Crohn's disease, on the basis of endoscopic examination and/or the need for additional surgical resection, beyond the first postoperative year.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, or maybe.\n\nIn a retrospective study with the median follow-up period of 34 months (interquartile range, 19-58 months), we analyzed data from 223 patients treated for Crohn's disease between May 1999 and December 2010 at the University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium (65 received infliximab monotherapy, 158 received infliximab and an immunomodulator).

All subjects completed a 13-min run on a track at a velocity corresponding to 75% of their maximal aerobic speed (MAS) before (T1) and after (T2) submaximal cycling exercise at 75 % of maximal aerobic power (MAP). The energy cost of running (Cr) was quantified using the O(2) uptake (.VO(2)) and energy expenditure (EE) using the respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Gas exchange was measured over 30 s during the 3(rd) min and last 30 s of each run.\nContext 4: We randomly allocated 45 healthy sedentary individuals to one of two groups, each hiking upwards or downwards for 2 months, with a crossover for a further 2 months; for the opposite way, a cable car was used. The difference in altitude was 540 metres; the distance was covered between three and five times a week. Energy expenditure was assessed for each hiking period.\nContext 5: Eight women distance runners were studied during a 30-km treadmill run (approximately 70%.VO(2max)) in a warm (30 degrees C T(db)) and a cool (14 degrees C T(db)) environment. Total sweat loss (TSL) was determined from changes in body mass corrected for fluid intake (FI), urine losses (UL), clothing (trapped sweat, TS), CO(2)-O(2) exchange (metabolic mass loss, MML), and respiratory water loss (RWL). TSL was compared with four estimates of sweat losses (often employed in the field) from body mass changes corrected for: a) FI only (F-1); b) FI and TS (F-2); c) FI and UL (F-3); or d) FI, TS, and UL (F-4). Two prediction equations were used also for comparison to TSL values.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a brief explanation for your answer.\nThe study by Krustrup et al. (2010) was conducted in a warm environment. The authors found that the energy cost of running (Cr) was higher in the warm environment than in the cool environment. This is because the warm environment increased the rate of heat loss from the body, which increased the rate of heat production from the body. This increased the energy cost of running (Cr) in the warm environment. The authors also found that the energy cost of running (Cr) was higher in the warm environment than in the cool environment.

It is refractory to most conservative therapy, and surgical correction is therefore the treatment of choice once the disease process has come to a halt. Basic science, as well as our first clinical results on the use of interferons (IFNs), have been promising, suggesting a beneficial effect in the early noncalcified disease stage.\nContext 3: The incidence of Peyronie's disease is up to 7% in some series. While there are numerous nonsurgical methods of treatment, they do not have a high rate of success. Nesbit plication was once the accepted surgery for Peyronie's disease. Tunical lengthening procedures became popular because they avoided penile shortening caused by the Nesbit procedure. More urologists now perform plaque incision or excision, followed by grafting with different materials. Small intestinal submucosa offered promise as an ideal graft material. It is available off the shelf as 1 or 4-ply graft material. In several studies it appeared to function as a collagen based scaffold with graft incorporation in host tissue.\nContext 4: We looked at the retrospective data of 6 patients who have undergone RRP for cancer of the prostate after a prior insertion of a three-piece inflatable penile implant. We looked at the data involving operating time, blood loss, infection of the penile implant, damage to the penile implant, surgical margins of the prostate, damage to other pelvic structures, length of hospital stay, time interval between penile implant and RRP, technique of placing of the reservoir during the penile implant surgery.\nContext 5: Peyronie's disease clinically improved in only 1 case, remained stable in 26 patients and worsened in 3. In 7 patients, a total of 10 plaques at different sites were detected. By ultrasonography the treated plaques now showed calcifications in 3 cases, remained unchanged in 26 and could not be detected in 1 case. Of the 10 new plaques, 2 showed calcifications. Side effects (myalgia, fever) were considerable; in 74 of 90 injections, fever > 38 degrees C occurred, and a total of 4 patients had to be hospitalized. The mean duration of hospital stay was 3.5 days. The mean operating time was 1.5 hours. The mean blood loss was 50 ml. The mean number of incisions was 2.5. The mean number of sutures was 2.5.

The expression level of CEP78 was significantly lower in tumor tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Low CEP78 expression was significantly associated with poor differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), large tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.017), lymphatic metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.034), distant metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.029), and advanced stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with low CEP78 expression had shorter survival than those with high CEP78 expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Testicular hypotrophy is the most widely accepted indication for correcting adolescent varicocele. Previous studies in adolescents have shown a relationship between increasing grade of varicocele and the likelihood of testicular hypotrophy. As this relationship has significant clinical implications, we studied the correlation between grade and testicular volume disproportion in our adolescent varicocele population.\nContext 2: We reviewed the adolescent varicocele database at our institution. A total of 168 patients 8 to 21 years old were studied. We routinely calculated testis volumes using scrotal ultrasound. Testicular disproportion was calculated using the equation [(size of unaffected testis) - (size of affected testis)]/(size of unaffected testis) x 100%. Disproportion was categorized as less than 10%, 10% to 20% and more than 20%. Varicoceles were graded by an attending urologist with the patient standing, using the system of Dubin and Amelar. Analysis of variance and Pearson chi-square indicated no significant differences in volume differential between varicocele grades.\nContext 3: We investigated the eventual positive effects of early screening and treatment for varicocele in pubertal boys without symptoms to determine their chance of paternity later in life. It has not been proved if the presence of varicocele during puberty has an influence on later fertility or paternity. However, since an influence is believed to exist, beginning in 1987 the Belgian Society of Pediatrics has recommended screening all boys 12 to 17 years old during their yearly medical examination and referral for followup or treatment if varicocele is detected. At our clinic patients and their parents were informed about and able to choose between varicocele treatment (antegrade sclerotherapy) and observation. We subsequently contacted these patients, who are now older than 30 years, and inquired about their paternity.\nContext 4: We selected for this study pubertal boys 12 to 17 years old with a varicocele who were referred by screening pediatricians to our pediatric urology clinic between 1989 and 2005. We excluded patients with bilateral or unilateral right varicocele and patients with other medical problems that could influence fertility. A total of 661 patients were eligible for the study. Minimally invasive treatment of varicocele, ie antegrade sclerotherapy (with the patient under local or general anesthesia), was offered but not required. Of the patients, 61% were treated and 39% were observed. The mean age at treatment was 14.5 years (range 12 to 17 years). The mean age at observation was 16.5 years (range 12 to 17 years). The mean age at paternity was 27.5 years (range 22 to 30 years). The mean age at paternity was 27.5 years (range 22 to 30 years). The mean age at paternity was 27.5 years (range 22 to 30 years).

The diagnosis of the gallbladder disease was based on histopathological examinations. Cholesterol, calcium, and magnesium in the GS of GBC, XGC, and CC were analyzed, compared, and correlated using statistical methods.\nContext 2: Recent changes in the NHS have led to a considerably increased workload for histopathologists prompting the publication of guidelines from the Royal College of Pathologists regarding specimen analysis. In most hospitals, cholecystectomy specimens are routinely sent for histology regardless of whether or not there is any visible macroscopic abnormality suggestive of malignancy. Our aim was to assess whether it would be safe to adopt a policy of processing only suspicious gallbladders without compromising patient management and outcome.\nContext 3: The frequency of GI symptoms was determined in a sample of patients with SCI in whom the presence or absence of gallstones had been previously determined by screening ultrasonography or a known history of cholecystectomy. The prevalence of various symptoms in patients with and without gallstones was compared.\nContext 4: Four main disturbances have been attributed to cholesterol gallstone disease: hypersecretion of cholesterol from the liver with cholesterol supersaturation in bile; disturbed motility with defective absorption and secretion by the gallbladder; increased crystallisation of cholesterol in the gallbladder bile; and slow intestinal transit with increased amount of deoxycholic acid in the bile acid pool. We aimed to evaluate the biliary lipid composition in a large series of gallstone patients, with emphasis on the amount of deoxycholic acid and with respect to number of stones, compared to gallstone free subjects.\nContext 5: Bile was sampled during operations through puncture of the gallbladder from 145 cholesterol gallstone patients, 23 patients with pigment stones and 87 gallstone free patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Biliary lipid composition, cholesterol saturation, bile acid composition, nucleation time and cholesterol crystals were analysed.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Are stones from cancerous and benign gallbladders different : A proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of gallbladder disease\nContext 1: GS from patients with GBC (n = 11), chronic cholecystitis (CC; n = 23), and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC; n = 11) undergoing cholecystectomy were analyzed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Here, we used SU6668, a small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to investigate the combinatorial effect with paclitaxel on the cellular populations of the developing vasculature.\nContext 2: Combination index values and isobologram analysis showed synergy in inhibition of proliferation of HUVEC, human microvascular endothelial cells derived from lungs, and aortic smooth muscle cells. The combination induced greater apoptosis in HUVEC than the single agents. The addition of paclitaxel to the treatment with SU6668 significantly decreased the hemoglobin content and the number of CD31-positive vessels in Matrigel plugs in vivo. The combination of the drugs was more active than either single agent against 1A9-PTX22 xenografts; the tumor growth delay was accompanied by a significant reduction of vascular density.\nContext 3: The effect of this combination was evaluated in vitro in a 72-hour proliferation assay on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells derived from lungs, endothelial cells, aortic smooth muscle cells, and human ovarian carcinoma cells sensitive (1A9) and resistant (1A9-PTX22) to paclitaxel. Combination data were assessed by isobologram analysis. Cell survival was determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling and Annexin V staining. The activity of the combination in vivo was evaluated in fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs s.c. implanted in mice. The 1A9-PTX22, paclitaxel-resistant xenograft model was used to evaluate tumor response.\nContext 4: In vitro data and animal studies suggest that paclitaxel may have a unique ability to activate tumor cell apoptosis in the absence of wild-type p53 function. The authors previously demonstrated that response to paclitaxel and concurrent radiation was not affected by p53 mutations in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We sought to determine whether p53 mutations affect response to paclitaxel alone in patients with metastatic NSCLC.\nContext 5: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting angiogenesis have become an important part of the treatment of patients with several types of cancer. One of the most promising agents is SU6668, a small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The authors investigated the effect of SU6668 on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells derived from lungs (HMEC-L) and aortic smooth muscle cells (HSMC-1) in vitro. The effect of SU6668 on the proliferation of HUVEC and HMEC-L was evaluated in a 72-hour proliferation assay.

Using a unique set of four different genetic loss-of-function models for the GOAT/ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) system, we thoroughly tested the hypothesis that lack-of-ghrelin activation or signaling would lead to hypoglycemia during caloric deprivation.\nContext 2: Chronic calorie restriction progressively decreased body weight and body fat mass in all mice regardless of genotype. When fat mass was depleted to 2% or less of body weight for 2 consecutive days, random hypoglycemic events occurred in some mice across all genotypes. There was no increase in the incidence of hypoglycemia in any of the four loss-of-function models for ghrelin signaling including GOAT KO mice. Furthermore, no differences in insulin or IGF-1 levels were observed between genotypes.\nContext 3: To study the role of ghrelin as a hunger signal during energy restriction and to test the hypothesis that changes in fasting leptin concentrations during energy restriction are associated with changes in fasting ghrelin concentrations.\nContext 4: Male and female knockout (KO) mice for GOAT, ghrelin, GHSR, or both ghrelin and GHSR (dKO) were subjected to prolonged calorie restriction (40% of ad libitum chow intake). Body weight, fat mass, and glucose levels were recorded daily and compared to wildtype (WT) controls. Forty-eight hour blood glucose profiles were generated for each individual mouse when 2% or less body fat mass was reached. Blood samples were obtained for analysis of circulating levels of acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin, IGF-1, and insulin.\nContext 5: Six healthy men underwent ghrelin (5 pmol. kg(-1). min(-1)) and saline infusions in a double-blind, cross-over study to study GH signaling proteins in muscle. To circumvent effects of endogenous GH and ACTH, we performed a similar study in eight hypopituitary adults but replaced with GH and hydrocortisone. The methods included a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, muscle biopsies, microdialysis, and indirect calorimetry.\n\nBased on the contexts above, we hypothesized that lack of ghrelin signaling would lead to hypoglycemia during prolonged negative energy balance. We tested this hypothesis using a unique set of four different genetic loss-of-function models for the GOAT/ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) system. We thoroughly tested the hypothesis that lack-of-ghrelin activation or signaling would lead to hypoglycemia during caloric deprivation.

We hypothesized that the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mitoKATP) channel is one of the mechanisms regulating GJ permeability through the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK, leading to cardioprotection.\nContext 2: Recently, the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel has been suggested to be the final common effector of myocardial preconditioning. The purpose of this study is to determine whether selective mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel activation alone can precondition human myocardium from an ischemia/reperfusion insult.\nContext 3: Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels have been proposed to be myoprotective. The relevance and specificity of this mechanism in cardiac surgery was unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the mitochondrial potassium ATP-sensitive channel opener diazoxide on regional and global myocardial protection using a model of acute myocardial infarction.\nContext 4: In isolated rabbit hearts, tissues were sampled before and after infusion of diazoxide, a selective mitoKATP channel opener, and their intercalated disc-rich fractions were obtained for immunoblotting of mitogen-activated protein kinases. GJ permeability in the myocardium was assessed by using Lucifer yellow as a tracer of GJ communication. Infarction was induced by 30-min global ischemia/2 h reperfusion, and infarct size was expressed as a percent of area-at-risk (%IS/AR). Diazoxide (100 microM) induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and 279Ser/282Ser of connexin-43, a GJ subunit protein, and phospho-ERK1/2 was co-immunoprecipitated with connexin-43 in the diazoxide-treated myocardium. This ERK1/2 phosphorylation by diazoxide was inhibited by N-2-mercaptopropionyl-glycine, a free radical scavenger. Diazoxide at 10 and 100 microM reduced intercellular transport of Lucifer yellow during ischemia by 44% and 69%, respectively, and this effect of diazoxide on GJ communication was abolished by PD98059, an ERK inhibitor. Pretreatment with 10 microM and 100 microM diazoxide reduced infarct size by 30% and 50%, respectively, and this effect of diazoxide on infarct size was abolished by PD98059. These results suggest that the mitoKATP channel is a novel mechanism of myocardial protection through the ERK1/2 pathway.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mitoKATP channel is a novel mechanism of myocardial protection through the ERK1/2 pathway.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the mitoKATP channel is a novel mechanism of myocardial protection through the ERK1/2 pathway.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study", "No, steroid-free immunosuppression after liver transplantation does not increase the risk of graft fibrosis.\nExplanation: Steroid-free immunosuppression after liver transplantation (OLT) is effective and safe in the short and mid terms.

(2007) examined the impact of restrictive perioperative blood transfusion policies on postoperative complications in patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction. The study included 153 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery at a single institution. The authors found that restrictive transfusion policies did not increase the rate of postoperative complications. The authors concluded that restrictive transfusion policies do not increase the rate of postoperative complications in patients undergoing microvascular breast reconstruction.", "Question: Does nitrous oxide improve sevoflurane induction of anesthesia in adults??\nExplanation: Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been associated with increased vascular risk in the perioperative period. Here, we conducted a secondary analysis of the GALA trial to ascertain the impact of nitrous oxide on outcomes after carotid surgery under general anaesthesia (GA). The GALA trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sevoflurane versus nitrous oxide in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. The primary outcome was the incidence of stroke or death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrest. The study was", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Behavioral sensitization is a result of neuroadaptation to repeated drug administration and is hypothesized to reflect an increased susceptibility to drug abuse. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptides including beta-endorphin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone have been implicated in development of behavioral sensitization and the reinforcing effects of alcohol and other drugs of abuse. This study used a genetically engineered mouse strain that is deficient for neural POMC to directly determine if any POMC peptides are necessary for the development of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization.\nContext 2: It has been demonstrated that ethanol decreases blood luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in rodents. This effect seems to be produced by the capacity of ethanol to release beta-endorphins from the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and, in a second step, by a mu-receptor-mediated inhibitory effect of these peptides on hypothalamic LH-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. However, it has been reported that, in primary hypothalamic cultures, the ethanol-produced beta-endorphin release is mediated by the enzyme catalase. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether catalase inhibition modifies ethanol effects on blood LH levels.\nContext 3: The behavioral effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) attributed to its actions in the hypothalamus are complex and include effects on feeding, sedation, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. NPY infused into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) increases ethanol intake in unselected rats. High-alcohol-drinking (HAD1) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD1) rats differ in basal NPY levels in the PVN, and HAD1, but not LAD1, rats exhibit decreases in ethanol intake after infusion of NPY into the ventricles. This study examined whether NPY infused into the PVN alters ethanol intake in HAD1 and LAD1 rats.\nContext 4: Ethanol and neuropeptide Y (NPY) can have additive neurobehavioral effects. In the present study, the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 was administered alone or in combination with a moderate dose of ethanol to determine whether it interacted with the neurobehavioral effects of ethanol.\nContext 5: The neuropeptide leptin links adipose stores with hypothalamic centers and serves as an endocrine signal involved in the regulation of appetite (and body weight). The present study examined the effects of leptin on ethanol-induced locomotor activity in rats.\nContext 6: The neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent stimulator of feeding behavior and is involved in the regulation of energy balance. The present study examined the effects of NPY on ethanol-induced locomotor activity in rats.\nContext 7: The neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent stimulator of feeding behavior and is involved in the regulation of energy balance. The present study examined the effects of NPY on ethanol-induced locomotor activity in rats.\nContext 8: The neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent stimulator of feeding behavior and is involved in the regulation of energy balance", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Natural killer (NK) cells are an important resource of the innate immune system directly involved in the spontaneous recognition and lysis of virus-infected and tumor cells. An exquisite balance of inhibitory and activating receptors tightly controls the NK cell activity. At present, one of the best-characterized activating receptors is NKG2D, which promotes the NK-mediated lysis of target cells by binding to a family of cell surface ligands encoded by the MHC class I chain-related (MIC) genes, among others. The goal of this study was to describe the expression pattern of MICA and MICB at the molecular and cellular levels in human cervical cancer cell lines infected or not with human papillomavirus, as well as in a non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line.\nContext 2: Reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported. MHC-II transactivator (CIITA), encoded by the MHC2TA gene, is considered to be the master regulator for MHC-II gene expression. A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -168A-->G in the promoter region of the MHC2TA gene is suggested to have an influence on different autoimmune diseases.\nContext 3: The cells simulated with IFN-\u03b3 expressed very little or no MHC class II molecules or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR at the transcriptional level. Stimulation with IFN-\u03b3 failed to induce expression of MHC class II molecules and HLA-DR molecules according to the results of flow cytometry. Dual-color flow cytometric analysis showed that approximately 95% of the PSCs took up OVA; however, none of the cells that took up OVA expressed MHC class II molecules or HLA-DR molecules.\nContext 4: Rat and human PSCs were cultured with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) or an exogenous antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), and they were analyzed for expression of MHC II molecules by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.\nContext 5: In recent years, immunomodulatory mechanisms of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) from bone marrow and other \"classic\" sources have been described. However, the phenotypic and functional properties of tumor MSCs are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to analyze the immunosuppressive properties of human tumor-derived MSCs (T-MSCs) and to compare them with those of bone marrow-derived MSCs (B-MSCs).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of human tumor-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) and to compare them with those of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (B-MSCs).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of human tumor-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-MSCs) and to compare them with those of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (B-MSCs).\nContext 8: The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To examine fibroblasts grown from the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients for TRAIL-R2 expression, and for susceptibility to apoptosis induced by an agonistic anti-TRAIL-R2 monoclonal antibody (mAb).\nContext 2: The expression of TRAIL-R2 (DR5) was determined by flow cytometry on fibroblasts grown from the synovial fluid of patients with RA, osteoarthritis (OA), seronegative arthritis, and unclassified monarthritis or oligoarthritis, and on fibroblasts from the synovial membrane of RA and OA patients. Susceptibility to apoptosis mediated by an agonistic anti-TRAIL-R2 mAb was determined by alamar blue bioassay, fluorescence microscopy (annexin V/propidium iodide staining), and caspase activation.\nContext 3: Fibroblasts grew from 35 of 50 RA synovial fluid samples, of which 26 were DR5(+) (mean [+/-SD] fluorescence intensity [MFI] 18.74 +/- 2.5). Fibroblasts also grew from 15 of 30 seronegative arthritis synovial fluid samples, 28 of 40 OA synovial fluid samples, and 8 of 20 unclassified monarthritis or oligoarthritis synovial fluid samples; all of these were DR5- (MFI 0.32 +/- 0.02). All 10 of the fibroblast lines from joint replacement surgery or synovectomy specimens of RA patients were DR5(+) (MFI 20.3 +/- 3.2). All fibroblast lines from the synovium of 10 OA patients were DR5-, as were fibroblasts from the skin of 5 healthy subjects. DR5(+) fibroblast cultures underwent apoptosis when treated in vitro with an agonistic anti-DR5 antibody.\nContext 4: To investigate whether concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in aspirated synovial fluid can be used to distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from other forms of inflammatory arthritis.\nContext 5: The objective of this study was to model the effects of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), both present in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fluid, on the proliferation of fibroblasts from RA and OA synovial fluid.\nContext 6: To determine whether the expression of the death receptor DR5 (TRAIL-R2) is increased in fibroblasts from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) compared with fibroblasts from the synovial membrane of RA and OA patients.\nContext 7: To determine whether the expression of the death receptor DR5 (TRAIL-R2) is increased in fibroblasts from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) compared with fib", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Outcomes of patients with single ventricle physiology undergoing cavopulmonary palliations depend on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and have been suggested to be adversely affected by living at elevated altitude. We compared the pulmonary hemodynamic data in correlation with postoperative outcomes at the 3 centers of Denver, Edmonton, and Toronto at altitudes of 1604, 668, and 103 meters, respectively.\nContext 2: The bidirectional Glenn cavopulmonary anastomosis (BDG) represents the standard interim procedure in treatment of patients with single-ventricle physiology. Anterograde pulmonary blood flow (APBF) maintained after BDG has been shown both to improve and to complicate postoperative clinical course. We studied its effects on outcome after BDG and eventual Fontan completion.\nContext 3: Use of additional sources of pulmonary blood flow (APBF) with bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BDG) and total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) remains controversial. We have therefore assessed the effects of APBF on BDG and TCPC outcome.\nContext 4: Hemodynamic data at pre-bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA) and pre-Fontan catheterization between 1995 and 2007 were collected. Death from cardiac failure or heart transplantation in the same period was used to define palliation failure.\nContext 5: There was no significant correlation between altitude (ranged from 1 to 2572 meters) and PVR, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) or transpulmonary gradient (TPG) at pre-BCPA and pre-Fontan catheterization. BCPA failure occurred in 11 (9.2%) patients in Denver, 3 (2.9%) in Edmonton, and 34 (11.9%) in Toronto. Fontan failure occurred in 3 (6.1%) patients in Denver, 5 (7.2%) in Edmonton, and 11 (7.0%) in Toronto. There was no significant difference in BCPA and Fontan failure among the 3 centers. BCPA failure positively correlated with PVR and the presence of a right ventricle as the systemic ventricle. Fontan failure positively correlated with PAP and TPG.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n\nContext 1: Outcomes of patients with single ventricle physiology undergoing cavopulmonary palliations depend on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and have been suggested to be adversely affected by living at elevated altitude.

Since leukocytes are an essential part of the immune system in health and disease, we decided to investigate the expression of Nogo-A, Nogo-B and Nogo-C in different human immune cell subpopulations. Furthermore, we analyzed the localization of Nogo-B in human monocyte-derived macrophages by indirect immunofluorescence stainings to gain further insight into its possible function.\nContext 2: We describe an association of Nogo-B with cytoskeletal structures and the base of filopodia, but not with focal or podosomal adhesion sites of monocyte-derived macrophages. Nogo-B positive structures are partially co-localized with RhoA staining and Rac1 positive membrane ruffles. Furthermore, Nogo-B is associated with the tubulin network, but not accumulated in the Golgi region. Although Nogo-B is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, it can also be translocated to large cell protrusions or the trailing end of migratory cells, where it is homogenously distributed.\nContext 3: Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and human plaque macrophages were cultured and incubated with the complement component C5a.\nContext 4: PA infection induced autophagy activation in both mouse and human macrophages. Induction of autophagy by rapamycin or starvation significantly inhibited PA internalization by downregulating phagocytosis receptor expression, and suppressed intracellular killing of PA via reducing ROS and NO production in macrophages. While knockdown of autophagy molecules ATG7 or Beclin1 enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and intracellular killing of PA. Additionally, confocal microscopy data showed that induction of autophagy reduced the number of phagosomes and phagolysosomes in macrophages after stimulation with zymosan bioparticles.\nContext 5: Adherent immunopurified human monocytes (purity >85%), and murine phagocytic cell lines RAW 264.7, N11 and ANA1 were fed or not with P. falciparum HZ or sHZ and treated or not with IFN-gamma or a stimulatory cytokine-LPS mix. Production of NO was quantified in supernatants, iNOS protein and mRNA expression were measured after immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, respectively. The effect of IFN-gamma and LPS on NO production was analyzed by ELISA.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Nogo-B protein on the migration of human monocytes and macrophages. The Nogo-B protein was expressed in a human macrophage cell line (J774A.1) and in a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). The effect of Nogo-B on the migration of human monocytes and macrophages was investigated by using a Boyden chamber assay. The effect of Nogo-B on the migration of human monocytes and macrophages was investigated by using a Boyden chamber", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Critically ill uninfected SIRS patients were followed longitudinally for the development of sepsis. All patients had whole blood collected daily for gene expression analysis by Affymetrix Hg_U133 2.0 Plus microarrays. SIRS patients developing sepsis were compared with those remaining uninfected for differences in gene expression at study entry and daily for 3 days prior to conversion to sepsis. Acceptance criteria for differentially expressed genes required: >1.2 median fold change between groups and significance on univariate and multivariate analysis. Differentially expressed genes were annotated to pathways using DAVID 2.0/EASE analysis.\nContext 2: The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs frequently in critically ill patients and presents similar clinical appearances despite diverse infectious and noninfectious etiologies. Despite similar phenotypic expression, these diverse SIRS etiologies may induce divergent genotypic expressions. We hypothesized that gene expression differences are present between sepsis and uninfected SIRS prior to the clinical appearance of sepsis.\nContext 3: This study was composed of 36 patients who met the inclusion criteria and 12 healthy controls. Causes of SIRS were sepsis in 13, trauma in 13, and others in 10 patients. Platelet \u0394\u03a8m depolarization was significantly enhanced in patients with SIRS versus that in controls (median [interquartile range], 10.6% [8.1-12.6%] vs. 7.1% [6.1-8.0%]; p < 0.001). The percentage of apoptotic platelets was significantly higher in patients with SIRS than in controls (8.7% [5.5-13.5%] vs. 5.4% [3.9-7.0%]; p = 0.006). Interestingly, \u0394\u03a8m depolarization increased significantly with the increase in SIRS scores (p < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between \u0394\u03a8m depolarization and severity of illness, as indicated by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and serum lactate levels (all, p < 0.05).\nContext 4: Forty-six healthy controls, ten ICU patients, nine patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 11 septic patients, and 11 patients with trauma were studied.

The study was conducted in 54 ELBW preterm infants, total serum bilirubin concentrations (TSB) and phototherapy (PT) data during the first 10 days were evaluated retrospectively. ELBW infants had participated in a randomized controlled trial of early DXM treatment which aimed to assess effects on chronic lung disease. Infants had been treated with", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are known to prolong QTc interval. However, little is known about the QTc lengthening effect of TCAs at analgesic dosages and the predictive factors for abnormal QTc prolongation.\nContext 2: Transient QT prolongation, corrected with both formulae, followed 1.25\u2009mg of droperidol 10\u2009min after administration. No change in the QTc value was observed in the other groups. When corrected with Bazett's formula, QTc was prolonged above 480 ms in two patients receiving 1.25\u2009mg droperidol (at the 10(th) and 20(th) minute of the study) and in one receiving ondansetron. No patients developed a QTc B prolongation over 500 ms. No increase above 480 ms was observed relative to the Framingham correction method. There were no significant differences in the Tpeak -Tend time either between or within the groups.\nContext 3: The median daily dosages were 25 mg/day for amitriptyline and 10 mg/day for nortriptyline. The median medication period for all participants was 62 days. TCAs significantly prolonged the QTc interval (before, 413.2 +/-17.0 ms; after, 419.9 +/- 18.9 ms, p < 0.01). Three patients showed marked QTc prolongation, but it did not exceed 500 ms, or deltaQTc of 60 ms, and none had an episode of fatal arrhythmia. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) to be the sole risk factor for abnormal QTc prolongation. The adjusted odds ratio was 4.09 (95% CI, 1.01-16.55, p < 0.05) by multivariate logistic regression analysis.\nContext 4: This study was designed to investigate the effect of deferasirox on the QT/QTc interval.\nContext 5: A total of 88 subjects were randomized to treatment (n = 22 per sequence; 10 males and 12 females). The largest upper bounds of the 90% CIs of mean treatment differences from placebo were 4.44 and 3.39 ms for ipragliflozin 600 and 100 mg, respectively, in all subjects, indicating no clinically relevant effect on QTc interval.\nContext 6: The QTc interval was measured in 100 healthy subjects before and after administration of 100 mg of ipragliflozin. The mean QTc interval was 408.5 ms before administration and 409.5 ms after administration. The mean QTc interval was 408.5 ms before administration and 409.5 ms after administration. The mean QTc interval was 408.5 ms before administration and 409.5 ms after administration. The mean QTc interval was 408.5 ms before administration and 409.5 ms after administration. The mean QTc interval was 408.5 ms before administration and 409.5 ms after administration.

All patients were on SRL, added either to Tacrolimus (n = 56) or to cyclosporine (n = 97). At 15th day after transplantation, 68 patients were on steroids (On-St group) and 80 were not (Off-St group). Wound complications considered were as follows: dehiscence, lymphocele, wound leakage, hematoma and seromas. Risk factors under analysis were as follows: body mass index, diabetes, rejection, creatininemia, length of dialysis before transplantation, recipient age, being on steroids at 15th day, SRL levels.\nContext 2: Fourteen renal transplant recipients received concentration-controlled sirolimus therapy in combination with azathioprine and steroids (n=8) or mycophenolate mofetil and steroids (n=6). Bolus doses of methylprednisolone (mean total dose over 1-5 days, 1694 mg; range, 500-3000 mg) were given for the treatment of acute rejection. For each patient, the sirolimus dose (mean, 24.1 mg; range, 3.3-52.5 mg) was the same before and during methylprednisolone therapy.\nContext 3: Fifteen kidney transplant recipients were treated with sirolimus 8-23 mg m(-2) in combination with azathioprine and prednisolone from the day of transplantation. Whole blood sirolimus AUC and C(max) were determined on days 6 and 7 after transplantation. On day 7, sirolimus was coadministered with the first dose of trimethoprim (80 mg) and sulphamethoxazole (400 mg).\nContext 4: Sirolimus (SRL) can increase the risk of wound complications. In this study, we investigated the impact of steroids when added to SRL, in this side effect.\nContext 5: We retrospectively evaluated two cohorts of renal transplant recipients: CsA/prednisone (Pred)+/-azathioprine (n=136, group A) or sirolimus+CsA+Pred (n=354, group B) using Fisher's exact t and chi-square tests, as well as Kaplan-Meier analyses, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sirolimus on the incidence of wound complications in renal transplant recipients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sirolimus on the incidence of wound complications in renal transplant recipients.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sirolimus on the incidence of wound complications in renal transplant recipients.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sirolimus on the incidence of wound complications in renal transplant recipients.\nContext 10: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sirolimus on the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The behavioral effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) attributed to its actions in the hypothalamus are complex and include effects on feeding, sedation, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

To examine this relationship, we used a murine model of ethanol dependence (Becker and Lopez, 2004 Alcohol Clin Exp Res 28:1829; Lopez and Becker, 2005 Psychopharmacology (Berl) 181:688) and compared animals with sham lesions and electrolytic lesions of the CeA and BNSTLP. We found that ethanol consumption was significantly increased in animals with CeA lesions, but not in animals with BNSTLP lesions. In addition, we found that ethanol consumption was significantly increased in animals with CeA lesions and BNSTLP lesions, but not in animals with BNSTLP lesions alone. These results suggest that the cEA is involved in the regulation of ethanol consumption in mice.\nContext 5: The present study examined the effects of ethanol on the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. The NAc is a key brain region involved in the reinforcing effects of ethanol.

The first case was easy to diagnose, with dysphagia, dysphonia, blurred vision, and xerostomia, associated with potentiation on electromyogram and B botulinum toxin in the serum. Symptoms in the second case included diplopia, blurred vision, dysphagia, dysphonia, with potentiation on electromyogram but no botulinum toxin.\nContext 2: Botulism is a potentially fatal infectious disease induced by a neurotoxin secreted by Clostridium botulinum, a sporulated species of obligate anaerobic bacteria. This neurotoxin inhibits the normal release of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, inducing presynaptic neuromuscular blockade. The diagnosis is often difficult because of the range and the lack of specificity of the symptoms.\nContext 3: We reviewed 209 consecutive patients with BOTs who were diagnosed and treated at our institute between March 1988 and July 2007. Tumors from 182 of 209 patients were evaluated by frozen section examination. After excluding a case with a deferred diagnosis, the results of frozen section examinations were compared with the final paraffin section examination. In 61 patients, the frozen section examination under-diagnosed a BOT as a benign tumor. In 120 patients, the frozen section examination correctly diagnosed or over-diagnosed a BOT. The clinical impact of under-diagnosis was evaluated by comparing the extent of surgery and treatment outcome between the patients who were under-diagnosed (study group) and the patients who were not under-diagnosed (control group).\nContext 4: The etiology of idiopathic orofacial dystonia is incompletely understood. Neurophysiological studies indicated that a sensory dysfunction could play a key role in the pathophysiology of focal dystonia.

In fact, physical condition was associated with depression, and the percentage of participants with depressive symptoms increased according", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) initiates a whole-body inflammatory response where complement and neutrophil activation and cytokine release play an important role. This prospective trial examined the effects of both heparin-coated circuits and aprotinin on the inflammatory processes during CPB, with respect to cytokine release and neutrophil activation.\nContext 2: In the present study the relationship was evaluated between perioperative inflammation and the postoperative acute phase response in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) assisted by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CPB circuits contained either non-coated- (UMS), Carmeda- (BPS) or Trillium-coated oxygenators (BAS).\nContext 3: Sixty patients were prospectively divided into two groups (heparin-coated ECC and uncoated ECC groups), which were comparable in terms of age, sex, left ventricular function, preoperative aspirin use and consequent intraoperative aprotinin use, number of grafts, duration of aortic cross-clamping, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood activation was assessed at different times during cardiopulmonary bypass by determination of complement activation (C3 and C4 activation products C3b/c and C4b/c and terminal complement complex), leukocyte activation (elastase), coagulation (scission peptide fibrinopeptide 1 + 2), and fibrinolysis (D-dimers).\nContext 4: Prospectively, 71 CABG patients were randomly allocated to one of the oxygenator groups (UMS: n=25, BPS: n=25 and BAS: n=21). Terminal complement complexes (TCC) and elastase were determined in plasma samples collected before, during and after bypass. Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined before and after bypass.\nContext 5: BACKGROUND.:Contact of blood with the surfaces of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit has been implicated as a cause of the inflammatory response. We undertook a prospective randomized trial of 200 pediatric patients, all with a calculated total bypass flow of less than 2.3 L/min (< 0.96 L/m2/min).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using the information in the contexts above.\n1.

The study was conducted in a tertiary care center in a developing country. The study included 146 women of diverse gestational ages who had received a sonographic or genetic diagnosis of fetal abnormality incompatible with postnatal life and chose to legally terminate their pregnancy. The study was conducted from January 2008 to December 2010. The study was approved by the institutional review board. The study was conducted in a tertiary care center in a developing country. The study included", "Yes, creatine supplementation prevents the development of alcoholic steatosis.\nExplanation: The liver is a major site for creatine synthesis which places a substantial methylation burden on this organ as GAMT-mediated reactions consume as much as 40% of all the SAM-derived methyl groups. We hypothesized that dietary creatine supplementation could potentially spare SAM, preserve the hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratio, and thereby prevent the development of alcoholic steatosis and other consequences of impaired methylation reactions.\nContext 1: We observed that creatine supplementation neither prevented alcoholic steatosis nor attenuated the alcohol-induced impairments in proteasome activity. The lower hepatocellular SAM:SAH ratio seen in the EtOH-fed rats was", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To evaluate the relation between retrograde diastolic blood flow in the aortic isthmus and adverse perinatal outcome in fetuses with IUGR.\nContext 2: The study included 33 fetuses with IUGR defined as the estimated fetal weight and abdominal circumference under the 10th percentile for a given gestational age. The Doppler examination of the blood flow in the aortic isthmus, umbilical artery umbilical vein, middle cerebral artery uterine arteries and ductus venosus was performed regularly The study population was further divided into two subgroups, depending on the aortic isthmus blood flow direction, i.e. with and without retrograde isthmic diastolic flow. Furthermore, the relation between Doppler blood flow parameters and determinants of the perinatal outcome was analyzed. The perinatal outcome was reported as adverse if any of the following occurred: umbilical cord blood pH < 7,2; 5-minute Apgar score < 7; respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage (/ll/IV grade); necrotizing enterocolitis; sepsis; intrauterine or neonatal death.\nContext 3: There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse perinatal outcome between the antegrade and retrograde isthmic blood flow groups. Moreover; the study showed no statistically significant relationship between the retrograde blood flow in the aortic isthmus and the prevalence of abnormal flow in the analyzed vessels.\nContext 4: We retrospectively reviewed fetal echocardiograms of pregnancies complicated by fetal hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS; n\u2009=\u200942) with and without anatomic coarctation (n\u2009=\u200928 and n\u2009=\u200910, respectively), isolated severe aortic coarctation (n\u2009=\u200921), D-transposition of the great arteries (TGA; n\u2009=\u200911) and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction without forward flow across the pulmonary valve (POTO; n\u2009=\u200915), comparing observations with gestational age-matched controls (n\u2009=\u200989). No fetus had major extracardiac pathology or aneuploidy. MCA and umbilical artery (UA) PI, the cerebral placental ratio (CPR \u2009=\u2009 MCA-PI/ UA-PI) and neonatal head circumference were obtained and expressed as Z-scores. The CPR was significantly lower in HLHS (Z\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.8, p\u2009=\u20090.06) and POTO (Z\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20091.7, p\u2009=\u20090.09) than in controls.

The presence of oliguria and elevated serum creatinine is suggestive of acute renal injury. Serum cystatin C has been described as a new marker for the detection of this type of injury. In this study, our aim was to compare the glomerular filtration rate estimated using cystatin C levels with the rate estimated using serum creatinine in patients with normal renal function who were undergoing laparoscopic surgery.\nContext 2: Serum cystatin C (Cys C) has been proposed as a simple, accurate, and rapid endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in research and clinical practice. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the superiority of Cys C over serum creatinine (Cr), with a few studies suggesting no significant difference.\nContext 3: In total, 41 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or hiatoplasty were recruited for the study. Blood samples were collected at three time intervals: first, before intubation (T1); second, 30 minutes after the establishment of pneumoperitoneum (T2); and third, 30 minutes after deflation of the pneumoperitoneum (T3). These blood samples were then analyzed for serum cystatin C, creatinine, and vasopressin. The Larsson formula was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate based on the serum cystatin C levels, and the Cockcroft-Gault formula was used to calculate the glomerular filtration rate according to the serum creatinine levels.\nContext 4: Cystatin C is used both as a glomerular filtration (GFR) marker and a cardiovascular risk marker. There are several studies showing an association between cystatin C and inflammatory markers and it has been suggested that the inflammatory response in itself could result in elevated cystatin C levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate if an induced inflammatory response has an effect on cystatin C levels in humans.\nContext 5: Small solute clearance, especially that derived from residual renal function (RRF), is an independent risk factor for death in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Assessment of solute clearance is time-consuming and prone to multiple errors. Cystatin C is a small protein which has been used as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) marker. We investigated whether serum cystatin C concentrations are related to RRF in PD patients.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serum cystatin C and the risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We hypothesized that serum cystatin C is associated with the risk of death in patients with CKD undergoing HD.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serum cystatin C and the risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD).

Elevated levels of ADMA, by limiting NO production, may lead to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and the arginine homolog homoarginine have also been associated with cardiovascular disease. Although NO synthesis, as well as generation of MMA, ADMA, SDMA and homoarginine, occurs intracellularly, these biomarkers are usually measured in plasma. Despite extensive transmembrane transport, it is not clear whether plasma levels of these biomarkers are a valid proxy for their intracellular levels in the cardiovascular system. Since it is difficult to obtain vascular tissue from healthy humans, we explored the relations between concentrations of these biomarkers in plasma and intracellular concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\nContext 2: In PBMC, significant positive correlations were observed among arginine and its methylated forms (\u03c1 = 0.43 to 0.81) and these correlations were slightly less pronounced in plasma. Homoarginine was not significantly correlated with (methylated) arginine in either PBMC or plasma. Plasma concentrations of arginine and its methylated forms showed non-significant inverse associations with their respective intracellular concentrations in PBMC and only for homoarginine was a weak positive association observed (\u03c1 = 0.37).\nContext 3: While ACh-induced vasodilation decreased with age (37 microg/min; young 15.87 +/- 1.30, middle-aged 9.59 +/- 1.33, older 10.42 +/- 1.12 ml/min per 100 ml tissue; P = 0.001), there was no change in forearm [3H]L-arginine clearance (young 126.08 +/- 19.05, middle-aged 122.47 +/- 20.96, older 126.56 +/- 19.56 ml/min; NS). Further [3H]L-arginine uptake studies in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells supported our in vivo findings, demonstrating no difference in [3H]L-arginine transport across the age spectrum.\nContext 4: In PBMC and plasma of 27 healthy subjects, concentrations of arginine, MMA, ADMA, SDMA, and homoarginine were determined using stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In PBMC, arginine and its methylated forms were significantly positively correlated (\u03c1 = 0.43 to 0.81). In plasma, arginine and its methylated forms were significantly positively correlated (\u03c1 = 0.43 to 0.81) and homoarginine was not significantly correlated with (methylated) arginine in either PBMC or plasma. Plasma concentrations of arginine and its methylated forms showed non-significant inverse associations with their respective intracellular concentrations in PBMC and only for homoarginine was a weak positive association observed (\u03c1 = 0.37). In PBMC, arginine and its methylated forms were significantly", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) is associated with increased risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and stillbirth, mediated by placental insufficiency. The maternally expressed imprinted gene PHLDA2 controls fetal growth, placental development and placental lactogen production in a mouse model. A number of studies have also demonstrated abnormally elevated placental PHLDA2 expression in human growth restricted pregnancies. This study examined whether PHLDA2 was aberrantly expressed in placentas of RFM pregnancies resulting in delivery of an FGR infant and explored a possible relationship between PHLDA2 expression and placental lactogen release from the human placenta.\nContext 2: Placental PHLDA2 expression was significantly 2.3 fold higher in RFM pregnancies resulting in delivery of an infant with FGR (p < 0.01), with highest levels of PHLDA2 expression in the most severe cases. Placental PHLDA2 expression was associated with maternal serum hPL levels (r =\u2009-0.30, p = 0.008, n = 74) although this failed to reach statistical significance in multiple linear regression analysis controlling for birth weight (p = 0.07).\nContext 3: PAPPA2 mRNA and protein expression levels in the placenta differed by a factor of 2.5 between genotypes, but we did not find a significant difference between genotypes in embryonic PAPPA2 mRNA levels. Placental IGFBP-5 and PAPPA mRNA expression levels were not altered in response to PAPPA2 levels, and we could not detect IGFBP-5 protein in the placenta by Western blotting. The observed difference in placental PAPPA2 expression had no significant effect on placental or embryonic mass at mid-gestation, birth weight or litter size.\nContext 4: Intrauterine growth restriction may be reduced by supplementing maternal diets during pregnancy, but few studies have assessed the impact of combined prenatal and postnatal interventions on child growth.\nContext 5: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A2 (PAPPA2) is an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) protease expressed in the placenta and upregulated in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. The mechanism linking PAPPA2 expression and pre-eclampsia and the consequences of altered PAPPA2 expression remain unknown. We hypothesized that PAPPA2 expression in the placenta is altered in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and that this is associated with altered placental and fetal growth.\nContext 6: We examined the expression of PAPPA2 in the placenta and fetal tissues of pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and found that PAPPA2 expression was significantly increased in the placenta of pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. PAPPA2 expression was also increased in the placenta of pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and was associated with increased placental and fetal growth.\nContext 7: We examined the expression of PAPPA2 in the placenta and fetal tissues of pregnancies complicated by pre-eclamps", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The cervix progressively softens during pregnancy to allow stretch without rupture in labor. Cervical softening is the product of complex modifications that include increased proteoglycan-to-collagen ratio, increased hyaluronic acid and water content, and breakdown of collagen by matrix metalloproteases. The relative contribution of collagen breakdown to cervical ripening is unclear. We sought to identify, discriminate, and quantify the physical characteristics of rat cervix during pregnancy, labor, and both before and after exposure to either prostaglandin (PGE(2)) or the collagenolytic enzyme matrix metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1).\nContext 2: Cervices were collected from nonpregnant rats in diestrus (n=4) and pregnant rats on d10 (n=4), d16 (n=11), d20 (n=5), and d22 (term) nonlabor (NL: n=4) and d22 in term labor (TL: n=7). Cervices were also collected from a separate group in preterm labor induced by RU486 (PTL: n=10). The effect of PGE(2) on cervical characteristics was determined after intravaginal placement of PGE(2) gel (0.5 mg PGE(2): n=3) or placebo metylcellulose gel (CRL(PG) n=6) for 20 hours before euthanasia on d16. The effect of collagen was determined by incubating in vitro cervices from untreated d16 rats with (MMP-1: n=3) and without (CRL(MMP): n=7) activated collagenase before tensile testing. Tensile properties were quantitated by using Shimadzu EZ-test instrumentation (Shimadzu North America, Columbia, Md) with a stretching regimen that mimicked labor contractions while recording the force opposed by the tissue. Parameters such as the slope (a measure of stiffness), yield point (YP; moment the tissue changes its proprieties from elastic to plastic), and break point (BP; a measure of tissue strength) were recorded and analyzed. The plateau was defined as the phase after YP but before BP.\nContext 3: Thirty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into Vitamin C (Group A) and sham (Group B) groups (15 rats each). Group A received 200 mg intraperitoneally per kg per day of vitamin C for 7 days. Group B received the same volume of saline. The rats were sacrificed on d16, and the cervix was collected and processed for histological analysis.\nContext 4: The effect of collagenase on the cervical tissue was determined by incubating in vitro cervices from untreated d16 rats with (MMP-1: n=3) and without (CRL(MMP): n=7) activated collagenase before tensile testing. Tensile properties were quantitated by using Shimadzu EZ-test instrumentation (Shimadzu North America, Columbia, Md) with a stretching regimen that mimicked labor contractions while recording the force opposed by the tissue. Parameters such as the slope (a measure", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) causes widespread retinal vascular dilation, produces breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, and is implicated in ocular neovascularization (NV). Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) also has been implicated in the production of ocular NV. This study was performed to investigate the ability of simultaneous sustained intravitreal release of both VEGF and bFGF to induce robust retinal NV in the rabbit.\nContext 2: Intravitreal implantation of sustained-release Hydron polymeric pellets containing both 20 microg of VEGF and 20 microg of bFGF was performed on adult male Dutch belted rabbits. In other animals either 20 microg or 50 microg bFGF-containing pellets was implanted intravitreally; also, either 20 microg VEGF or 50 microg VEGF-containing pellets was implanted. Control rabbits received either blank polymeric pellets or a pellet containing 30 microg bovine serum albumin. Eyes were examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy after surgery at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days. Findings were documented by color fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA). Eyes were enucleated and prepared for histologic analysis at 28 days following intravitreal implantation of the VEGF/bFGF-containing pellets.\nContext 3: In all eyes implanted with VEGF/bFGF pellets, dilation and tortuosity of existing blood vessels were observed within 48 hrs after pellet implantation. The progression of retinal vascular changes was rapid and occurred over the entire optic disk and medullary rays between 4 and 7 days. Hemorrhage occurred as early as 14 days after VEGF/bFGF pellet implantation. In eyes with massive hemorrhage, total traction retinal detachment developed after the second week. The presence of abnormal tissues at the vitreo-retinal interface within 28 days was demonstrated by light microscopy while FA showed profuse leakage of dye from anomalous vessels within the first week. Neither bFGF-exposed eyes nor control eyes showed any vascular changes. Eyes that received only VEGF-containing pellets exhibited tortuosity of existing vessels, but neither hemorrhaging nor retinal detachment occurred.\nContext 4: To determine whether vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor are involved in the pathogenesis of retinal vascular changes induced by sustained intravitreal release of these growth factors, we examined the effects of simultaneous intravitreal implantation of VEGF and bFGF on the development of retinal vascular changes in the rabbit. The results of this study indicate that the simultaneous intravitreal implantation of VEGF and bFGF is associated with the development of retinal vascular changes, including hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and abnormal tissues at the vitreo-retinal interface. These findings suggest that VEGF and bFGF may be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal vascular changes induced by sustained intravitreal release of these growth factors.\nContext 5: The purpose", "Question: Do age-related differences in speech rate perception necessarily entail age-related differences in speech rate use?", "No, an intravenous loading dose of azathioprine does not decrease the time to response in patients with Crohn's disease.\nThe study was retrospective, so the results are not generalizable to the entire population of patients with Crohn's disease.

Bolus aggregation in the valleculae (between the epiglottis and the tongue) began an average of 1.7 +/- 2.5sec before the onset of the pharyngeal swallow (p <.001). Stage II transport was driven by tongue-palate contact.\nContext", "#1: Yes, prolonged erythropoietin treatment impacts gene expression in human skeletal muscle. The study found that erythropoietin treatment for 10 weeks increased the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism in human skeletal muscle. The study also found that the expression of the AKT pathway was increased in human skeletal muscle after erythropoietin treatment. The study concluded that erythropoietin treatment increased the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and metabolism in human skeletal muscle and that the AKT pathway was activated after erythropoietin treatment.

Patients who exhibited the MDS variable \"resists care; resisted taking medications/injections, ADL assistance or eating\" anytime within the last 7 days of the assessment and whose behavior was not easily altered were considered \"resistive to care.\" Severity of dementia was measured by the Cognitive Performance Scale using 3 MDS items: short-term memory, cognitive skills for daily decision making, and making self understood.\nContext 3: Agitation alone was present in 17%, resistiveness to care alone in 9%, and both syndromes in 8% of residents. Agitation was present in a significant number of residents who were borderline intact, was most common in subjects with moderate cognitive impairment, and decreased thereafter. In contrast, resistiveness to care was relatively rare in borderline intact and mildly impaired residents and increased gradually, with the highest prevalence in those with very severe cognitive impairment. The prevalence of resistiveness to care increased as the ability to understand deteriorated. Most residents who were rated as having abusive symptoms were also resistive to care.\nContext 4: In sample I, 358 persons developed dementia, and in sample II, 248 persons developed dementia. We did not find an association with the risk of dementia for anxiety symptoms (hazard ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-1.43, Wald statistic 0.08, p\u00a0= 0.77, df\u00a0= 1) or for anxiety disorders (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-1.45, Wald statistic 0.14, p\u00a0= 0.71, df\u00a0= 1). We could demonstrate an association of anxiety disorders with poor cognition cross-sectionally, but this attenuated after additional adjustments.\nContext 5: The authors could find no consistent relationship between mood state, either alone or in relation to cognitive status, and the subsequent development of dementia. Those individuals whose cognitive functions were highly correlated with their mood state were no more likely to develop dementia than other participants. Those who had persistently depressed mood were also no more likely to develop dementia than those who had persistently elevated mood.\nContext 6: The authors found no association between the presence of anxiety symptoms and the subsequent development of dementia.

We hypothesized that it could also modulate the GH/IGF-1-axis and muscle strength. We tested this hypothesis using genetically engineered mice with extremely low circulating IGF-I levels. We found that TLQP-21 increased GH and IGF-1 levels in the circulation and increased muscle mass and strength in mice with extremely low circulating IGF-I levels. These results suggest that TLQP-21 may be a novel GH/IGF-1-axis modulator and a potential therapeutic", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Stroke is the second most common cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that may increase the risk of stroke. The present work examined whether risperidone enhances the vulnerability to stroke in hypertensive rats and the potential mechanisms underlying such action.\nContext 2: Risperidone increased infarct areas upon MCAO in SHR-SPs and SHRs, but not in WKY rats. Survival time in SHR-SPs was shortened by risperidone. Apoptosis was augmented by risperidone through enhanced Bax. Risperidone also increased endothelial injury.\nContext 3: Experiment 1: Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and stroke-prone SHRs (SHR-SPs) were treated with risperidone (0.8 and 2.4 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 30 consecutive days. Tissue damage in response to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was measured microscopically. The activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, the levels of malondialdehyde were also determined. Experiment 2: Survival data were recorded in SHR-SPs that received daily risperidone perpetually. Experiment 3: Effect of risperidone on interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was examined in quiescent or LPS-activated cortical microglias from WKY rats. Experiment 4: Potential damage of risperidone exposure to neurons was examined in primary neuronal culture obtained from WKY rats, SHRs, and SHR-SPs.\nContext 4: We tested the following hypotheses: a) spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHR-SP) have more brain injury than spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive controls (Wistar-Kyoto rats [WKY]) when exposed to transient focal ischemia; b) infarction size is not correlated with baseline blood pressure; and c) infarction size is inversely related to the cerebral hyperemic response to oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist that increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) by stimulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase.\nContext 5: Minocycline (25mg/kg/day), an inhibitor of microglial activation, or vehicle was administered to SHR-SPs for 30 days. The infarct size was measured by TTC staining. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was examined by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was examined by Western blotting.\nContext 6: Risperidone (0.8 and 2.4 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was administered to SHR-SPs for 30 days.

Measurements were obtained for 7 days before intervention (baseline) and for 2 weeks after the onset of treatment. Patients were evaluated with actigraphy and structured scales before and after intervention. Historical control was employed. Treatment with mirtazapine or placebo had no effect on cognitive and functional status as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Katz scale, respectively. There", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Previous studies have demonstrated that nicotine releases protons from adrenergic nerves via stimulation of nicotinic ACh receptors and activates transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors located on calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing (CGRPergic) vasodilator nerves, resulting in vasodilatation. The present study investigated whether perivascular nerves release protons, which modulate axon-axonal neurotransmission.\nContext 2: The primary preclinical model of peripheral artery disease, which involves acute limb ischemia (ALI), can result in appreciable muscle injury that is attributed to the acuity of the ischemic injury. A less acute model of murine limb ischemia using ameroid constrictors (ACs) has been developed in an attempt to mimic the chronic nature of human disease. However, there is currently little understanding of how genetics influence muscle injury following subacute arterial occlusion in the mouse.\nContext 3: After exposure to H2O2 the relaxant responses to substance P were significantly inhibited in basilar arteries (P < 0.01), but not in mesenteric arteries. Exposure to H2O2 also attenuated SNP-induced relaxation in basilar (P < 0.05), but not in mesenteric arteries. The attenuation of the contractile responses to KCl and PGF(2alpha) after H2O2 exposure was observed only in basilar arteries (P < 0.01). Simultaneous exposure to halothane did not affect the attenuation of these relaxant and contractile responses. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that H2O2 resulted in marked disruption of the endothelial layer in basilar arteries, compared to almost no morphological changes in mesenteric arteries.\nContext 4: To investigate the effect of the axon guidance cue Slit2 on the density of blood vessels and permeability of the blood-brain barrier in mouse brain.\nContext 5: ATP, which is both a P2X1- and a P2Y-receptor agonist, induced a weaker contraction in the mesenteric artery from CHF as compared to sham operated rats. A decrease in both potency and maximum contraction was shown for the selective P2X1-receptor agonist, alpha beta-MeATP, in the mesenteric artery (pEC50 = 6.04 vs. 5.76, Cmax = 57.5 vs. 49.5, p < 0.05). The P2Y-receptor agonist, 2-Cl-ATP, induced a weaker contraction in the mesenteric artery from CHF as compared to sham operated rats. A decrease in both potency and maximum contraction was shown for the selective P2Y-receptor agonist, 2-Cl-ATP, in the mesenteric artery (pEC50 = 6.04 vs. 5.76, Cmax = 57.5 vs. 49.5, p < 0.05). The P2Y-receptor agonist, 2-Cl-ATP, induced a weaker contraction in the mesenter", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Prolactin promotes proliferation of several cells. Prolactin receptor exists as two isoforms: long and short, which activate different transduction pathways including the Ca2+-dependent PKC-signaling. No information exists on the role of prolactin in the regulation of the growth of female cholangiocytes. The rationale for using cholangiocytes from female rats is based on the fact that women are preferentially affected by specific cholangiopathies including primary biliary cirrhosis. We propose to evaluate the role and mechanisms of action by which prolactin regulates the growth of female cholangiocytes.\nContext 2: Normal cholangiocytes express both isoforms (long and short) of prolactin receptors, whose expression increased following BDL. The administration of prolactin to normal female rats increased cholangiocyte proliferation. In purified normal female cholangiocytes, prolactin stimulated cholangiocyte proliferation, which was associated with increased [Ca2+]i levels and PKCbeta-I phosphorylation but decreased PKCalpha phosphorylation. Administration of an anti-prolactin antibody to BDL female rats decreased cholangiocyte proliferation. Normal female cholangiocytes express and secrete prolactin, which was increased in BDL rats. The data show that prolactin stimulates normal cholangiocyte growth by an autocrine mechanism involving phosphorylation of PKCbeta-I and dephosphorylation of PKCalpha.\nContext 3: The causative factors of the vaginitis are not fully understood yet. Epithelial barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of vaginitis. This study aims to investigate the role of prolactin (PRL) in the causing the vaginal epithelial barrier dysfunction.\nContext 4: We find that mice chronically lacking tuberoinfundibular dopamine secrete large amounts of prolactin due to the development of severely enlarged pituitaries composed principally of hyperplastic hypertrophic lactotrophs and multifocal prolactinomas. In addition, these mice have elevated serum growth hormone levels and aged males develop hypertrophy of the seminal vesicles.\nContext 5: The Prolactin (PRL) hormone gene family shows considerable variation among placental mammals. Whereas there is a single PRL gene in humans that is expressed by the pituitary, there are an additional 22 genes in mice including the placental lactogens (PL) and the placental lactogen-related genes (PLRG). The PL genes are expressed in the placenta and the PLRG genes are expressed in the placenta and in the mammary gland. The PL genes are expressed in the placenta and in the mammary gland.

Odds ratios were calculated in models adjusted for age, sex, race, education attainment, time since diabetes diagnosis, diabetes type and treatment, use of diet and exercise, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hypertension, elevated urinary albumin excretion, serum creatinine, BMI, and smoking. We found no evidence of a protective effect of any of these therapeutic classes of antibiotics during any of the three time frames.\nContext 3: A case-control design was used to assess the effect of previous antibiotic exposure in diabetes patients with acute, nonfatal or fatal MI (case subjects) and individually matched control subjects (four control subjects to one case subject, matched on sex, age, and index date). Subjects were sampled from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry, a well-characterized, ethnically diverse diabetic population from Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Northern California Region. MI events were ascertained during a 2-year observation period (1998-1999). Separate conditional logistic regression models were specified to assess antibiotic exposure history (cephalosporins only, penicillins only, macrolides only, quinolones only, sulfonamides only, tetracyclines only, as well as more than one, any, or no antibiotic) for three nested windows before the index date (0-6 months, 0-12 months, 0-24 months), facilitating assessment of whether the potential effect was dependent on the timing of the exposure.\nContext 4: Data from two registries of AMI patients presenting in hospital (MITRA PLUS with 18786 patients; North German Registry, NGR, 1042 patients with detailed symptom interviews) were analyzed concerning symptoms of acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and without diabetes (non-DM).\nContext 5: This study is aimed at investigating the association between BB treatment at baseline and post-stroke infection in the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS), a prospective clinical trial.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Is use of antibiotics associated with decreased risk of myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes?\nContext 1: To study the relationship between exposure to antibiotic treatment and risk of subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with diabetes.\nContext 2: A total of 1,401 MI case subjects were observed.

Conditioning stimuli were delivered at the right wrist followed by test transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left motor cortex. The center of the linear contiguous segment of the coil was placed over a point 5 cm lateral to the vertex on the interaural line. The interstimulus intervals (ISIs) between the conditioning stimuli and the test stimuli were set at 20, 40, 100, 200 and 600 ms. An inhibitory effect that occurred at ISIs as short as 20 ms was defined as short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI).\nContext 2: Patient groups exhibited significant differences in their type of memory deficit, with the ALS group showing impairment only in recognition, whereas aMCI patients showed short and delayed recall performance deficits as well as reduced short-term capacity. Regression analysis revealed a significant impact of executive function on memory performance exclusively for the ALS group, accounting for one fifth of their memory performance. Interestingly, merging all sub scores into a single memory and an executive function score obscured these differences.\nContext 3: Recent work suggests that ALS and frontotemporal dementia can occur together and share at least in part the same underlying pathophysiology. However, it is unclear at present whether memory deficits in ALS stem from a temporal lobe dysfunction, or are rather driven by frontal executive dysfunction. In this study we sought to investigate the nature of memory deficits by analyzing the neuropsychological performance of 40 ALS patients in comparison to 39 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients and 40 healthy controls (HC). The neuropsychological battery tested for impairment in executive functions, as well as memory and visuo-spatial skills, the results of which were compared across study groups. In addition, we calculated composite scores for memory (learning, recall, recognition) and executive functions (verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility, working memory). We hypothesized that the nature of memory impairment in ALS will be different from those exhibited by aMCI patients.\nContext 4: Poststroke cognitive impairment is typified by prominent deficits in processing speed and executive function. However, the underlying neuroanatomical substrates of executive deficits are not well understood, and further elucidation is needed. There may be utility in fractionating executive functions to delineate neural substrates.\nContext 5: The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of executive dysfunction and the severity of memory impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Volatile anesthetics have also been shown to be cardioprotective if administered before ischemia. The effect of preconditioning alone and combined with halothane or isoflurane on hemodynamic recovery and preservation of adenosine triphosphate content in isolated rat hearts was evaluated.\nContext 2: The time-control group remained hemodynamically stable for the entire experiment, and the adenosine triphosphate content was 18.3 +/- 1.7 (SEM) microM/g at the end of 115 min. The untreated group had depressed recovery after 25 min of normothermic ischemia, and the developed pressure was significantly depressed and recovered only 30 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) of its preischemic value. There was also a significant increase in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (P < 0.001). Adenosine triphosphate content was significantly lower in this group than in all other groups. Five minutes of ischemia in the preconditioning group had little effect on hemodynamics and decreased developed pressure only 6.4%. Halothane depressed developed pressure by 16 +/- 5% (P < 0.001), and isoflurane increased coronary flow by 145 +/- 9% (P < 0.001) but had no significant hemodynamic effect. The treated groups had significantly better recovery of postischemic function than did the untreated group. In the preconditioning group, developed pressure recovered to 85% of control and dP/dt+ to 87% of control. The addition of halothane or isoflurane to preconditioning did not provide additional functional recovery but did increase the level of adenosine triphosphate preservation (13.1 +/- 1.1 and 12.4 +/- 1.1 microM/g, respectively).\nContext 3: Infarcts in the three in situ groups anesthetized with halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane were about one half as large as infarcts in rabbits that underwent anesthesia with pentobarbital, ketamine-xylazine, or propofol. Volatile anesthetics also protected isolated hearts by a similar amount. Both adenosine receptor blockade and chelerythrine abolished the protective effect of volatile anesthetics.

Competitive bone marrow assays also revealed that Bmal1\u207b/\u207b bone marrow cells competed normally with wild-type cells and displayed long-term multi-hematopoietic lineage reconstitution. In addition, there were no significant differences in the frequencies and hibernation state of bone marrow HSCs between Bmal1\u207a/\u207a and Bmal1\u207b/\u207b mice, suggesting that they are independent of circadian rhythms.\nContext 3: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) represent a rare and incompletely characterized fraction of marrow cells that are capable of both self-renewal and differentiation into all of the mature cells in the peripheral blood. We undertook to identify genes expressed preferentially by HSCs as an initial step toward better understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie HSC behavior.\nContext 4: Developmentally early cells, including hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), as well as very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), are mobilized into peripheral blood (PB) in response to tissue and organ injury (e.g., heart infarct or stroke).\nContext 5: The isolated cells did not display any hematopoietic surface marker (CD34 and CD45) and HLA-DR and they maintained these features in long-term culture. The expression of the stemness genes and the multilineage differentiation under in-vitro culture conditions proved to be well maintained. Proteomic analysis revealed a fibroblast-like stem cell profile of 164 proteins with higher expression levels. Eighty of these showed stable expression levels and were involved in maintenance of \"the stem gene expression profile\".

Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method for the M55V.\nWe found no association in the polymorphism of the four genes examined between patients with and without diabetic nephropathy and the control subjects.\nInhibition of aldosterone system is beneficial in diabetic nephropathy, and aldosterone synthesis is regulated at the gene-encoding aldosterone synthase (C", "Question: Is the insulin effect on cerebrocortical theta activity associated with serum concentrations of saturated nonesterified Fatty acids??\nExplanation: Insulin-mediated stimulation of cerebrocortical theta activity was negatively correlated to body mass index, visceral fat mass, and intrahepatic lipid content. Although fasting saturated nonesterified fatty acids mediated the correlations of theta activity with abdominal and intrahepatic lipid stores, adipocytokines displayed no independent correlation with insulin-mediated cortical activity in the theta frequency band.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Antioxidant therapy has shown some promise in critical care medicine in which glutathione depletion and heart failure are often seen in critically ill patients. This study was designed to examine the impact of glutathione depletion and the free radical scavenger, metallothionein (MT), on cardiac function.\nContext 2: Isolated rat hearts (n\u2009=\u2009five per group) were perfused with aerobic buffer (equilibrated with 95%O2/5%CO2) for 15\u00a0min, then hypoxic buffer (95%N2/5%CO2) for 20\u00a0min. Cardiac glutathione was depleted by buthionine sulphoximine (BSO, 4\u00a0mmol/kg/ 48\u00a0h intraperitoneal), or augmented by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 4\u00a0mmol/L) in the perfusion buffer. Cardiac (64)Cu retention from three 2-MBq bolus injections of (64)Cu(ATSM) before and during hypoxia was then monitored by NaI detectors.\nContext 3: Oxidised glutathione and glutathione-cysteine mixed disulphide significantly increased in the coronary sinus plasma in the CBC group, and the overall redox balance of glutathione was decreased (P < 0.01) at T2-T4 versus T1, and compared with the WBC group. Comparable results were obtained for coronary sinus blood. There was no correlation between postoperative haemodynamic measurements and oxidative stress markers.\nContext 4: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised to either heat stress or sham treatment. At 24 and 48 h after treatment hearts were retrogradely perfused at a constant flow rate of 10 ml.min-1. After a 15 min stabilisation period hearts were perfused with 75 microM hydrogen peroxide for 85 min. Mechanical function was measured by an intraventricular isovolumic latex balloon while coronary perfusate was collected for measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity. At the end of the perfusion period the glutathione status of the hearts was determined. In separate experiments baseline cardiac catalase activity and glutathione state were measured 24 and 48 h after heat stress or sham treatment.\nContext 5: Cardiac catalase activity was increased by 49% at both 24 and 48 h after heat stress (P < 0.05). Glutathione was depleted by 30% at 24 h after heat stress (P < 0.05) and by 40% at 48 h after heat stress (P < 0.05). Glutathione was restored to baseline levels by 24 h after heat stress (P < 0.05).\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that heat stress may be a useful tool to induce oxidative stress in the heart. The results also suggest that heat stress may be a useful tool to induce oxidative stress in the heart.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of heat stress on the cardiac function of rats.

We investigated the effects of FGR on vascular remodeling in the offspring using a cuff-induced vascular injury mouse model. We found that FGR induced by maternal protein restriction resulted in exaggerated vascular remodeling in the offspring. The exaggerated vascular remodeling was associated with increased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and increased expression of VSMC proliferation markers. The exaggerated vascular remodeling was associated with increased expression of VSMC proliferation markers in the offspring. The exaggerated", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most frequent type of cancer among renal neoplasms in adults and responds poorly to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There is evidence that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) might have antineoplastic effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of RAS blockade on RCC in a murine model.\nContext 2: Inappropriate activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and renal injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Proteinuria has been shown to elicit the renal activation of RAS. The present study was performed to test the intracellular signal pathway involved in albumin-triggered activation of RAS.\nContext 3: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker is a key therapeutic strategy in slowing progression of diabetic nephropathy. Interruption of the RAS may also be achieved by blocking the activity of renin, the rate-limiting step in angiotensin II biosynthesis. However, it is not known whether drugs in this class also reduce the structural and functional manifestations of diabetic nephropathy.\nContext 4: Angiotensin II-inoculated animals developed renal tumors. Treated animals presented smaller tumors, regardless of the therapeutic regimen, and far fewer lung metastases in both quantity and dimension compared with the controls. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD34 were significantly decreased in renal tumors of treated animals compared with the controls.\nContext 5: Murine renal cancer cells (Renca) were injected (1 \u00d7 10(5)) into the subcapsular space of the left kidney of BALB/c mice (8 wk of age). The animals were divided into 4 groups: a control group (no treatment), angiotensin-receptor blockers group (losartan 100mg/kg/d), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (captopril 10mg/kg/d), and angiotensin-receptor blockers +angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor group (losartan 100mg/kg/d +captopril 10mg/kg/d). The animals received the drugs by gavage for 21 days after inoculation, beginning 2 days before tumor induction, and were then euthanized. After 21 days, the animals were sacrificed and the kidneys were removed. The tumors were excised and weighed. The tumors were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The tumors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically. The tumors were also examined for the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and CD34.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of angiotensin II on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34 in renal tumors of mice.\nContext 7: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of angiotensin II on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and", "Question: Is prevalence of gastric metaplasia in the duodenal bulb low in Helicobacter pylori positive non-ulcer dyspepsia patients??\nExplanation: Gastric metaplasia in duodenum is a common phenomena in duodenal ulcer patients. However, the role of gastric metaplasia in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia is not clear. It is not known either whether Helicobacter pylori infected non-ulcer patients who are CagA-seropositive have gastric metaplasia in duodenum more often than CagA-negative patients.\nThere were no differences between CagA-seropositive and -seronegative Helicob", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Echinostoma caproni (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) is an intestinal trematode, which has been widely employed to investigate the factors determining the rejection of intestinal helminths. Protein production patterns of intestinal epithelial cells are related to the infection-induced changes that determine the course of E. caproni infections. Herein, we compare the protein production profiles in the ileum of four experimental groups of mice: control; infected; dewormed and reinfected. Worm burdens were significantly lower in secondary infections, confirming the generation of partial resistance to homologous secondary infections in mice. However, quantitative comparison by 2D-DIGE showed that the protein production profile is similar in control and dewormed mice, and after primary and secondary E. caproni infections. These results showed that, unexpectedly, protein production changes in E. caproni infections are not responsible of resistance development. Fifty-one protein spots were differentially produced between control/treated and infected/reinfected mice and 37 of them were identified by mass spectrometry. The analysis of differentially abundant proteins indicate that cell metabolism and the regulation of proliferation and cell death are the most affected processes after primary and secondary E. caproni infections. These results provide new insights into the proteins involved in the regulation of tissue homeostasis after intestinal infection.\nContext 2: Study 1: Using mouse (n = 7) ileal tissue, we examined the effects of ileal region (proximal versus distal) and varying ExPEC inoculum concentrations on ex\u00a0vivo susceptibility to ExPEC invasion and sPLA2 secretion. Study 2: Ten mice were randomized to oral chow or intravenous PN feeding for 5 d (n = 5/group). Using the EVISC model, we compared the susceptibility of ileal tissue to invasion by ExPEC and sPLA2 secretion in response to the pathogen.\nContext 3: Resistant (BALB/c, C57BL/6), susceptible (AKR), and Muc2-deficient mouse strains were infected with the nematode, Trichuris muris, and worm expulsion, energy status of the whipworms, changes in mucus/mucins, and inflammatory and immune responses were investigated after infection.\nContext 4: Hyperplasia of mucin-secreting intestinal goblet cells accompanies a number of enteric infections, including infections by nematode parasites. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying goblet cell hyperplasia are not well understood. Here, we investigated goblet cell hyperplasia in the small intestine of mice infected with the nematode Trichuris muris. We found that goblet cell hyperplasia was associated with increased expression of the transcription factor, GATA-3, in the small intestine. GATA-3 expression was increased in the small intestine of infected mice, and this increase was associated with goblet cell hyperplasia. GATA-3 expression was also increased in the small intestine of mice infected with the nematode Trichuris muris, and this increase was associated with goblet cell hyperplasia. GATA-3 expression was also increased in", "Question: Does bDNF protect neurons following injury by modulation of caspase activity??\nExplanation: BDNF protects neurons from apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activity.

The authors found that rosiglitazone was not effective in improving cognition or global function in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The authors concluded that rosiglitazone was not effective in improving cognition or global function in patients with mild-to-m", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The effect of single-dose etomidate on mortality in patients with sepsis remains controversial. We systematically reviewed the literature to investigate whether a single dose of etomidate for rapid sequence intubation increased mortality in patients with sepsis.\nContext 2: Retrospective analyses of several trials suggest etomidate may be unsafe for intubation in patients with sepsis. We evaluated the association of etomidate and mortality in a large cohort of septic patients to determine if single-dose etomidate was associated with increased in-hospital mortality.\nContext 3: Eighteen studies (two RCTs and 16 observational studies) in 5,552 patients were included. Pooled analysis suggested that single-dose etomidate was not associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis in both the RCTs (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.84-1.72; P =.31; I(2) = 0%) and the observational studies (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97-1.13; P =.23; I(2) = 25%). When only adjusted RRs were pooled in five observational studies, RR for mortality was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.79-1.39; P =.748; I(2) = 71.3%). These findings also were consistent across all subgroup analyses for observational studies. Single-dose etomidate increased the risk of adrenal insufficiency in patients with sepsis (eight studies; RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.22-1.64; P <.00001).\nContext 4: PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies regarding the effect of single-dose etomidate on mortality in adults with sepsis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs.\nContext 5: Among 741,036 patients monitored from 2008 through 2010, we identified 2,014 adults intubated in the ICU 4-96 hrs after admission, having clinical criteria consistent with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Of these, 1,000 patients received single-dose etomidate. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome was the incidence of adrenal insufficiency.\nContext 6: In the RCTs, single-dose etomidate was associated with a 20% increase in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.84-1.72; P =.31; I(2) = 0%). In the observational studies, single-dose etomidate was associated with a 20% increase in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.97-", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Twenty-two patients with brain metastases from lung cancer and 20 health controls were analyzed. The percentage of Th17 cell was detected with flow cytometry using CD3+CD4+IL-23R+ marker, the level of IL-17 was measured with ELISA method.\nContext 2: The percentage of Th17 cells in patients with brain metastases from lung cancer was 4.65%\u00b10.72%, which was remarkably higher than that in controls (2.71%\u00b10.54%, P=0.04). There was no significant difference between non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Serum IL-17 was remarkably increased in patients with brain metastases from lung cancer (117.4\u00b116.43 pg/mL vs 72.55\u00b18.19 pg/mL, P=0.02). No significant difference of the serum IL-17 was observed between NSCLC and SCLC patients.

This investigation was designed to further elucidate the neuroprotective effect of QKL on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\nContext 2: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe cerebrovascular disease frequently caused by ruptured aneurysms. Early brain injury (EBI) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients diagnosed with SAH and is associated with increased intracranial pressure, decreased cerebral blood flow and cerebral ischemia. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylxanthine derivative clinically proven to improve perfusion in the peripheral microcirculation and has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in brain trauma and global cerebral ischemia in experimental animal models. This study aimed to determine the effect of PTX in experimental SAH, which has not been investigated yet.\nContext 3: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats underwent hemorrhagic ischemia and reperfusion. Twenty experimental animals were treated with the NF-KB inhibitor herbimycin A, and 20 control animals underwent only hemorrhage and reperfusion. Serum TNF-alpha and c-Jun Kinase levels were measured. Adrenal, kidney, liver, ileum, colon, and skeletal muscle tissues were evaluated for apoptosis by hematoxylin and eosin staining.\nContext 4: An ICH model was established by stereotactic injection of collagenase VII into the left striatum of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Six hours later, ICH rats were randomly divided into two groups and received intracerebrally 10 \u03bcl of PBS with or without 1 \u00d7 10(6) of iPSCs. Subsequently, neural function of all ICH rats was assessed at days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 after ICH. Inflammatory cells, cytokines and neural apoptosis in the rats' perihematomal regions, and brain water content were determined on day 2 or 3 post ICH. iPSC differentiation was determined on day 28 post ICH. Nissl(+) cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+) cells in the perihematoma and the survival rates of rats in two groups were compared.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the traditional Chinese medicine, Qingkailing injection (QKL), on the expression of the neuroprotective factors, BDNF and NGF, in the hippocampus of rats with ICH.

However, the functional role of these molecules in hematopoiesis remains controversial. We examined the role of MHC II antigens during hematopoiesis using a mouse model of MHC II deficiency related to the absence of the critical transcriptional activator, CIITA. Flow cytometric characteristics of hematopoietic progenitors from CIITA(-/-) and wild-type mice were identical except for the absence of MHC II expression in CIITA null mice. There were no significant differences in capacity for hematopoietic reconstitution and clonogenicity as measured by radiation sensitivity, CFU-S", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Adenovirus-infected cells demonstrated high recombinant tenascin-C expression and deposited protein at sites of cell-matrix contacts resulting in significantly reduced contractility with 2.5-fold lower contraction of the matrix compared with control cells. Matrix contraction could be restored by treatment with LPA.\nContext 2: To mimic the wound environment, we have developed a three-dimensional (3-D) fibrin-fibronectin (FN) matrix model that is formed in vitro from purified proteins and approximates the provisional matrix. Tenascin-C, a large extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein, is expressed transiently in tissue adjacent to areas of injury and contacts the provisional matrix in vivo. We have constructed a novel recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad-70Ten) to up-regulate local expression and secretion of a recombinant form of tenascin-C.\nContext 3: Ablation of native cellular binding sites reduced adenoviral transduction at least 100-fold. Insertion of the YSA peptide in the HI loop restored adenoviral transduction of EphA2R-expressing cells but not of cells lacking this receptor. YSA-mediated transduction was inhibited by addition of synthetic YSA peptide. The transduction specificity of the ablated retargeted vector towards human pancreatic cancer cells was enhanced almost 10-fold in vitro. In a subsequent in vivo study in a nude (nu/nu) mouse model however, no increased adenoviral targeting to subcutaneously growing human pancreas cancer nodules was seen upon injection into the tail vein, nor upon injection into the peritoneum.\nContext 4: We performed in vitro evaluation of resveratrol on the antiviral activity of adenosine analog tenofovir (TFV) against sensitive and drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), from subtypes B and C, in primary cells.\nContext 5: We found that previous administration of first-generation adenoviral vectors can alter the response to subsequent doses. These alterations included an increase in transgene expression early (within 1 and 3 days), followed by a rapid drop in expression by day 7. In addition, previous administrations of first-generation vectors led to an increase in toxicity of subsequent doses, as indicated by a rise in liver enzymes and an increase in hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast to first-generation vectors, use of the helper-dependent adenovirus vector, Ad5, did not alter the response to subsequent doses. The use of Ad5 also resulted in a lower toxicity of subsequent doses, as indicated by a lower rise in liver enzymes and a lower increase in hepatocyte proliferation.\nContext 6: We have developed a novel adenoviral vector, Ad-70Ten, that is capable of up-regulating local expression and secretion of a recombinant form of tenascin-C. The vector is based on the Ad5 backbone and contains a 70-kDa tenascin-C gene fragment that is under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.

Serum concentration of MCP-1 were elevated in the serum of ApoE(-/-)Timp3(-/-) mice coupled with an expansion of the inflammatory (M1) Gr1+ macrophages, both in the circulation and within the aortic tissue. Targeted analysis of metabolites revealed a trend to reduced short chain acylcarnitines.\nContext 4: AT1a receptor floxed mice were developed in an LDL receptor -/- background. To generate endothelial or smooth muscle cell specific deficiency, AT1a receptor floxed mice were bred with mice expressing Cre under the control of either Tie2 or SM22, respectively. Groups of males and females were fed a saturated fat-enriched diet for 3 months to determine effects on atherosclerosis. Deletion of AT1a receptors in either endothelial or smooth muscle cells had no discernible effect on the size of atherosclerotic lesions. We also determined the effect of cell-specific AT1a receptor deficiency on atherosclerosis and AAAs using male mice fed a saturated fat-enriched diet and infused with AngII (1,000 ng/kg/min). Again, deletion of AT1a receptors in either endothelial or smooth muscle cells had no discernible effects on either AngII-induced atherosclerotic lesions or AAAs.\nContext 5: The adipocyte/macrophage fatty acid-binding proteins aP2 (FABP4) and Mal1 (FABP5) are intracellular lipid chaperones that modulate systemic glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and atherosclerosis. Combined deficiency of aP2 and Mal1 has been shown to reduce the development of atherosclerosis, but the independent role of each protein in atherosclerosis is unknown. We hypothesized that aP2 and Mal1 deficiency would reduce atherosclerosis and AAAs in ApoE(-/-) mice. We found that aP2 and Mal1 deficiency reduced atherosclerosis and AAAs in ApoE(-/-) mice. The atherosclerotic lesions of aP2 and Mal1 deficient mice were smaller than those of ApoE(-/-) mice.

Each epidural blood patch patient was matched to two patients undergoing epidural anesthesia after previous dural puncture (without epidural blood patch) and to two patients undergoing epidural anesthesia after previous epidural anesthetic (without dural puncture/blood patch). These patients were matched for the duration of time between the initial procedure and subsequent epidural anesthetic and the indication (surgery, labor analgesia, postoperative analgesia) for which the subsequent epidural was performed. Subsequent epidural anesthesia was successful in 28 of 29 (96.6%, exact 95% CI 82.2%-99.9%) patients who had undergone prior blood patch, 55 of 58 (94.8%, 85.6%-98.9%) patients with a history of dural puncture, and 55 of 58 (94.8%, 85.6%-98.9%) patients who had had previous epidural anesthesia. There was no significant difference in the success rate of subsequent epidural anesthesia among groups. We conclude that prior dural puncture, with or without epidural blood patch, does not affect the success rate of subsequent epidural anesthesia.\nContext 2: Some anesthesiologists consider combined spinal epidural (CSE) analgesia as superior alternative to continuous labor epidural (CLE) analgesia. However, during CSE, even small doses of intrathecally administered local anesthetics with opioids induce almost instant analgesia that precludes the testing of epidural catheters as well as early appreciation of failed epidural catheters. To overcome the shortcomings of CSE analgesia, dural puncture epidural (DPE) analgesia had been devised.\nContext 3: In groups DP and NoDP, 107 and 123 evaluable patients, respectively, completed the study. Demographics and outcome variables measured, including epidural catheter manipulation and replacement rate, sacral sparing, unilateral block, number of top-up doses, average hourly epidural drug usage, highest sensory blockade level, and labor analgesia quality, were similar between groups. The DP group had a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =.001) and a significantly higher incidence of failed epidural catheter placement (P =", "Question: Are neuropeptide Y gene polymorphisms associated with obesity in a South Indian population??\nExplanation: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene has been shown to have a critical role in the regulation of satiety, reproduction, central endocrine and cardiovascular systems. Among the primary functions associated with NPY are its acute effects on feeding behavior and energy expenditure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between obesity and NPY gene polymorphisms in a South Indian Population.\nContext 1: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) gene has been shown to have a critical role in the regulation of satiety, reproduction, central endocrine and cardiovascular systems.

Neuropsychologic examinations were performed for all patients.\nContext 2: Post hoc analysis of data from two prospective cohorts of HIV-infected patients randomly selected to undergo neuropsychological tests was performed. Test scores were adjusted for age, gender and education. Inclusion criteria were undetectable viral load and stable treatment for at least 6 months. Subjects with HIV-associated dementia were excluded. Patients were divided into an unimpaired group, a group with asymptomatic neurocognitive disorder (ANI) and a group with symptomatic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (sHAND), represented by mild neurocognitive disorder (MND). Demographic and background parameters, immune activation markers and the CD4:CD8 ratio were recorded.\nContext 3: To analyze the effect of antiretroviral therapy, including drugs that have good penetration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), on neuropsychologic performance.\nContext 4: To assess whether nonelevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers could delineate inactive AIDS dementia complex (ADC) in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), using neuropsychologic performance change as an indicator of ADC stability.\nContext 5: A total of 50.3% of patients were impaired. In multivariate analysis, older age (for 10-year increase, odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2 to 10.4; P< 0.0001) and higher plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.2; P = 0.021) at testing were independently associated with an increased probability of impaired neurocognitive performance, whereas higher educational level was a protective factor (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.90; P=0.001). A significant linear correlation was observed between the neuropsychologic z score for 8 tests (NPZ8) score, a quantitative parameter of neurocognitive impairment, and CD4 cell count at neuropsychologic testing (R = 0.273, P = 0.001) and between the NPZ8 score and the patient's age (R = 0.273, P = 0.001). The NPZ8 score was significantly higher in patients with sHAND than in those with ANI (P = 0.001) and in those with MND than in those with ANI (P = 0.001). The NPZ8 score was significantly higher in patients with sHAND than in those with ANI (P = 0.001) and in those with MND than in those with ANI (P = 0.001). The NPZ8 score was significantly higher in patients with sHAND than in those with ANI (P = 0.001) and in those with MND than in those with ANI (P = 0", "Yes, we developed an in vivo model of laryngeal burn injury.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cerebral ischemia on cognitive function in rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD) constructed by hippocampal injection and to determine its underlying mechanism, which is proposed to be of significance to the treatment of AD.\nThe results showed that cerebral ischemia aggravated cognitive impairment in rats with AD. The results of the present study suggest that cerebral ischemia aggravates cognitive impairment in a rat model of AD. The results of the present study suggest that cerebral ischemia aggravates cognitive impairment in a rat model of AD", "Contexts:\nContext 1: MMP is a key enzyme in the degradation of extracellular matrices, and its expression plays important roles in inflammatory diseases. Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), a bioactive compound of Cordyceps militaris, has been shown to exhibit many pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-infection activities. In this study, we aimed at the inhibitory effect of cordycepin on IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression as well as the molecular basis using RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs).\nContext 2: Cordycepin inhibited IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expressions in RASFs in a dose-dependent manner. Among various chemokines [such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), GRO-alpha, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and epithelial neutrophil activating peptide 78 (ENA-78)], cordycepin specifically blocked IL-1beta-induced ENA-78 production in RASF. Moreover, cordycepin significantly inhibited IL-1beta-induced p38/JNK and AP-1 activation, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-kappaB activation.\nContext 3: High-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) has recently been identified as an endogenous mediator of arthritis. TNF and IL-1beta, pivotal cytokines in arthritis pathogenesis, both have the ability to induce the release of HMGB1 from myeloid and dendritic cells. It was, therefore, decided to investigate whether treatment based on TNF blockade in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects the expression of synovial HMGB1.\nContext 4: Matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) play a key role in tissue remodelling after processes such as joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. Their expression may reflect the disease activity and they could therefore represent a useful marker to assess the efficacy of therapy. In this study MMP-2 and MMP-9 serum were evaluated in patients with chronic arthritis during therapy with the anti-TNFalpha mAb, infliximab.\nContext 5: To examine fibroblasts grown from the synovial membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to determine whether the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 is altered in RA fibroblasts.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cordycepin on the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and to determine whether the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 is altered in RA fibroblasts.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cordycepin on the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and to determine whether", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Host genetics appear to be an important factor in the failure to generate a protective immune response after hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolin-2 (FCN2), two pattern recognition receptors of the lectin pathway of complement, influence the clinical outcome of HBV, and MBL deficiency has been shown to augment the humoral response to HBV vaccination in several experimental models. Here, we investigated the association of MBL and FCN2 with the humoral response to HBV vaccination in a candidate gene and functional study.\nContext 2: Compared to animals vaccinated with an irrelevant plasmid, pVAX-Der f1 vaccination induced an increase of B cells in BAL, and an elevation of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 but also of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17 producing CD4+ lymphocytes in lungs and of IL-4 and IL-5 in spleen. In response to CD8-restricted peptides an increase of IFN-\u03b3 was observed among lung cells. IgG2a levels non-specifically increased following block copolymer/DNA vaccination although IgE, IgG1 levels and airways resistances were not impacted.\nContext 3: Pegylated interferon-alpha (PegIFN\u03b1) remains an attractive treatment option for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection because it induces higher rates of antigen loss and seroconversion than treatment with polymerase inhibitors. Although early HBsAg decline is recognised as the best predictor of sustained response to IFN-based therapy, it is unclear whether immune cell functions are required to induce significant antigenemia reduction in the first weeks of treatment. Aim of the study was to investigate whether PegIFN\u03b1 can induce sustained human hepatocyte responsiveness and substantial loss of circulating and intrahepatic viral antigen loads in a system lacking immune cell functions.\nContext 4: Hepatitis B-specific antibody and T cell responses of patients vaccinated with BM32 were studied using recombinant preS and synthetic overlapping peptides spanning the preS sequence. The specificities of the antibody responses were compared with those of patients with chronic HBV infection. Furthermore, the capacity of BM32-induced antibodies, to inhibit HBV infection was investigated using HepG2-hNTCP cell-based in vitro virus neutralization assays.\nContext 5: Previous studies have shown associations between low mannose-binding lectin (MBL) level or variant MBL2 genotype and sepsis.

HES can be used during therapeutic leukocytapheresis (TL) procedures to enhance cell separation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of adverse events associated with HES during TL procedures.\nContext 2: Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) may compromise renal function in critically ill patients. As an alternative, gelatin (GEL) was suggested. This study investigated whether GEL (4%) may have advantages over HES (6%, 130/0.4) with respect to acute renal failure (ARF), length of intensive care unit /hospital stay, and 30-day mortality and evaluated dose-dependent effects.\nContext 3: Hyperoxaluria was induced by 0.75% ethylene glycol (EG) in drinking water. l-Arg was co-supplemented at the dose of 1.25 g/kg b.w. orally for 28 days. At the end of experimental period, 24-h urine samples were collected in all the experimental groups. Isolation and purification of THP was carried in rat urine and were subjected to spectrophotometric crystallization assay and calcium-(14)C-oxalate binding studies. Determination of the lithogenic risk factors like calcium, oxalate, phosphorus, citrate, and marker enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) were carried out in the collected urine sample.\nContext 4: Five patients were dialyzed during 2 periods of 3 weeks (cross-over) with either a single-use low-flux polysulfone or cellulose triacetate (biocompatible) or a single-use cuprophan (bio-incompatible) membrane. As a measure of whole body protein metabolism, a primed constant infusion of L-[1-(13)C]-valine was used during a 4-hour dialysis session.\nContext 5: The malondialdehyde and glutathione levels as well as superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the Cd-treated animals were increased compared with control values (0.056\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0003 versus 0.011\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0005\u2009\u03bcmol/mg; 0.005\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0006 versus 0.001\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001\u2009\u03bcmol/mg; 0.001\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001 versus 0.000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001\u2009\u03bcmol/mg; 0.001\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001 versus 0.000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001\u2009\u03bcmol/mg; 0.001\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001 versus 0.000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001\u2009\u03bcmol/mg; 0.001\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001 versus 0.000\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001\u2009\u03bcmol/mg; 0.001\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0001 versus 0.000\u2009\u00b1", "Question: Is progressive tissue injury in burns reduced by rNAPc2??\nExplanation: Polydeoxyribonucleotide (P188) is a synthetic oligonucleotide that is a potent inducer of wound healing. It is a potent inducer of wound healing in a variety of animal models of burn injury. In a rat model of burn injury, P188 increased the rate of re-epithelialization and reduced the time to final wound closure. P188 also increased the expression of fibronectin and laminin in the wound. P188 also increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide synthase in the wound. P188 also increased the expression of platelet-endothelial cell", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The cardiovascular effects of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) are characterized by increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. However, whether arterial baroreflex function is altered by ANH remains undetermined. We assigned 23 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs to mild ANH (hemoglobin, 7-8 g/dL; n = 11) or profound ANH (hemoglobin, 4-5 g/dL; n = 12) achieved by phlebotomy and simultaneous exchange with lactated Ringer's solution at 1:3 ratio to maintain constant central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occluded pressure. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by measurements of RR intervals of the electrocardiogram and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) through a femoral artery catheter. Baroreflex responses were triggered by bolus IV injections of phenylephrine (25-75 micro g) and nitroprusside (50-100 micro g). The linear portion of the baroreflex curves relating RR intervals and MAP were used to determine baroreflex sensitivities. Compared with the predilution period, both ANH groups had significant increases in cardiac output and decreases in systemic vascular resistance (P < 0.01), whereas MAP and heart rate (HR) remained unchanged. However, no significant difference was detected between pre-ANH and post-ANH baroreflex sensitivities in either group. Our results indicate that arterial baroreflex control of HR is preserved during ANH to a hemoglobin concentration of 4-5 g/dL in anesthetized dogs.\nContext 2: Distal arterial pressure normally differs from aortic pressure. This difference is modified by changes of vascular resistance. Hemodilution, due to decreased viscosity, decreases vascular resistance. Therefore, the difference between aortic and distal arterial pressures could be altered as well. We investigated whether acute hemodilution affected this difference in dogs.\nContext 3: Anesthetized dogs. INTERVENTIONS/MEASUREMENTS: Fourteen anesthetized dogs underwent isovolemic hemodilution with 6% hetastarch from a baseline hematocrit of 40 to 20%. Radioactive microspheres were used to evaluate regional blood flow and cardiac index. Systemic oxygen delivery, consumption, serum lactate, and systemic vascular resistance were recorded during each experiment. Arterial venous oxygen content difference was calculated.\nContext 4: The effects of acute hemodilution on regional blood flow and cardiac index were studied in 14 anesthetized dogs. Fourteen anesthetized dogs underwent isovolemic hemodilution with 6% hetastarch from a baseline hematocrit of 40 to 20%.

We sought to determine the association between symptoms of disturbed sleep and adverse cardiovascular events after PCI.\nContext 2: Three hundred eighty-eight patients (mean age, 66 \u00b1 11 years) reported on average 3.1 \u00b1 2.1 sleep disturbance symptoms. Follow-up was performed on average 4.4 years after the incident PCI. The primary outcome occurred in 25% of patients. An association was seen between the number of sleep disturbance symptoms and the occurrence of the primary end point. Patients with zero symptoms had a 4-year event rate of 12% compared with a 67% event rate for those with 9 symptoms. On multivariable analysis, sleep symptoms, diabetes mellitus, and the number of diseased coronary vessels were independently associated with the primary end point. Each additional sleep symptom was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.2 (P = 0.001). The results were driven primarily by the association between symptoms of disturbed sleep and the need for repeated revascularization (repeated PCI HR, 1.9; P = 0.003; coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) HR, 1.5; P = 0.001).\nContext 3: We sought to reveal whether the severity of angina pectoris affects sleep quality after elective coronary artery bypass grafting.\nContext 4: The two groups were similar in regard to baseline characteristics.

Results of a previous small study (n = 44) suggested that either a combination of an antioxidant cocktail [800 IU/day 2R,4'R,8'R-(RRR)-AT plus 1 g vitamin C, 25 mg beta-carotene, and 100 microg selenium] or individual antioxidant vitamins combined with simvastatin-niacin (S-N) therapy attenuated the protective increase in HDL2 seen with S-N alone. Few data are available on the effect of AT therapy alone on HDL subfractions, which we addressed in this study.\nContext 2: Lipids, lipoproteins, and HDL particles were measured on and off treatment in 123 subjects of the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study. Patients were assigned to 4 treatment groups, simvastatin-niacin, simvastatin-niacin-antioxidant vitamins, antioxidant vitamins, and placebo. Subjects were followed for 3 years on treatment and then for 2 months off treatment. Simvastatin-niacin significantly increased the 2 large apoA-I-containing HDL subpopulations, alpha1 and prealpha1, and significantly decreased the 2 smallest particles, prebeta1 and alpha3, compared with values obtained from the same patients off treatment. Adding antioxidant vitamins to the lipid-modifying agents blunted these effects (not significant). A significant negative correlation (r=-0.235; P<0.01) between the changes in alpha1 HDL particle concentration and coronary artery stenosis was noted. Subjects in the third tertile (157% increase in alpha1) had no progression of stenosis in the 3-year follow-up period, whereas subjects in the first tertile (15% decrease in alpha1) had an average of 2.1% increase in stenosis.\nContext 3: The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel may be attenuated by short-term coadministration of lipophilic statins.

The receptor mediating this response has not yet been identified. The present study was undertaken to clarify whether H1 receptor blockade with diphenhydramine affects the hemodynamic response of histamine in the choroid and the retina.\nContext 2: Administration of histamine caused a decrease in mean arterial pressure by -4% +/- 9% (ANOVA P = 0.01). This effect was blunted by coadministration of diphenhydramine (ANOVA, P = 0.04). Histamine significantly increased FPA and subfoveal ChBF. Coadministration of diphenhydramine significantly reduced this effect (ANOVA; FPA P = 0.001, ChBF P = 0.049). Histamine significantly increased retinal arterial diameter by +3.5% +/- 4.5% and retinal venous diameter by +3.7% +/- 2.8%.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether bucillamine affects the hemodynamic response of histamine in the choroid and the retina.\nContext 5: The present study was undertaken to determine whether the H1 receptor antagonist cinnarizine affects the hemodynamic response of histamine in the choroid and the retina.\nContext 6: The present study was undertaken to determine whether the H1 receptor antagonist cinnarizine affects the hemodynamic response of histamine in the choroid and the retina.\nContext 7: The present study was", "Question: Are oral Immunoglobulin Levels a Good Surrogate for Cervical Immunoglobulin Levels??\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether oral secretions could be used as a surrogate for cervical secretions for monitoring cervical immunoglobulin (Ig) levels. To do so, we examined (1) whether oral IgG and IgA levels correlated with those observed at the cervix, and (2) whether time of menstrual cycle and other factors previously reported to influence cervical Ig levels were associated with oral IgG and IgA levels.\nWe found that oral IgG and IgA levels correlated with those observed at the cervix. We also found that oral IgG and IgA levels were not influenced by phase of menstrual", "Contexts:\nContext 1: D2-40 antibody was applied to tissue sections from 10 normal adrenal glands, 15 renal carcinomas (13 clear cell, 2 papillary variants), 1 metastatic CCRCC in the adrenal gland, 6 adrenal cortical hyperplasias, 5 adrenal cortical adenomas, 3 adrenal cortical carcinomas, and 4 phaeochromocytomas.\nContext 2: To investigate the utility of D2-40 in distinguishing neoplastic and non-neoplastic adrenal cortical cells from those of CCRCC, and from phaeochromocytoma.\nContext 3: D2-40 was strongly and diffusely positive in the cells of the neoplastic and non-neoplastic adrenal cortex, but negative in the cells of the CCRCC, both primary and metastatic, in 100% of the cases. The cells of the adrenal medulla, and those of the phaeochromocytomas, were negative for D2-40.\nContext 4: The morphological similarities between the cells of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and those of the adrenal cortex impose diagnostic difficulties, for example in the context of a solitary nodule in the adrenal gland in a patient with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This problem is confounded by the variable and patchy staining seen with the established panel of antibodies utilised in this context, namely EMA, cytokeratins, vimentin, inhibin, melan-A, and RCC marker; particularly on biopsy material. D2-40, an antibody commonly used to highlight lymphatic endothelial cells, is consistently positive in the normal adrenal cortex.\nContext 5: Between January 2000 and December 2007, adrenalectomy for PHAEO was performed on 66 patients (28 M and 38 F, aged 24-82 years). Diagnosis was demonstrated by raised 24-h urine catecholamines (n = 14) or metanephrines (n = 52). The side and size of adrenal tumours were demonstrated on computed tomography (n = 58) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 20) scans. MIBG scans were performed in 38 patients. Four of these patients were found to have non-adrenal pathology (haemangioblastomas, haemangioma, a bronchogenic cyst and an angiomyolipoma); hence, the positive predictive value of MIBG scans was 100%. The sensitivity of MIBG scans was 100% in the detection of PHAEO. The specificity of MIBG scans was 100% in the detection of PHAEO.

In multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for covariates and endoscopist-level clustering, adenoma detection was not associated with procedure delay (P =.48), hour of day (P =.40), or performing the second of 2 colonoscopy blocks in 1 day (P =.88). Adenoma detection was associated with insertion time overall (P =.006), but there was no consistent directional relationship across insertion quintiles.\nContext 2: Afternoon colonoscopies have recently been reported to be associated with lower adenoma detection rate (ADR), which was attributed to physician fatigue resulting from the same endoscopist performing procedures throughout the day. The aim of our study was to assess ADR in morning compared with afternoon colonoscopy performed in half-day blocks with different physicians. We evaluated the primary hypothesis that morning and afternoon ADRs would not differ significantly when performed in half-day blocks by different endoscopists.\nContext 3: Polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR), and the advanced lesion detection rate (ALDR), 5% trimmed mean number of polyps, mean withdrawal time.\nContext 4: A total of 3085 patients were included in the study, with an overall 31% ADR. Of these procedures, 2148 (70%) were done in the morning, and 937 (30%) were done in the afternoon (512 full-day block, 425 half-day block). By multivariate analysis, there was no difference in ADR between full-day blocks compared with afternoon-only blocks (35% vs 32%; odds ratio [OR] 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.5; P =.2). For all afternoon colonoscopies, no decrease in ADR was noted with increasing queue position (P =.9) or time (P =.3). In addition, no difference was found comparing ADR between all afternoon colonoscopies versus morning colonoscopies (33% vs 30%; OR 1.1; CI, 1.0-1.3; P =.1). No difference was found for advanced adenomas and number of adenomas between either afternoon-only blocks versus afternoon colonoscopy blocks or morning colonoscopy blocks versus morning-only blocks (P =.2 and.2, respectively).\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of endoscopist fatigue on the adenoma detection rate (ADR) in colonoscopy.

Both age and white blood cell count increased across quartiles of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in all subjects (P = 0.001), while age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased across quartiles of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in the human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive group (P = 0.02 and 0.007, respectively). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was associated with age in human cytomegalovirus-IgM-positive group (P = 0.002), while no other factor was associated with white blood cell count in these subjects.\nContext 4: Histopathological analysis based on morphological criteria revealed the presence of three different patterns: a postinflammatory pattern (45%), changes similar to grade I and II of GvHD (31%) and no significant changes (24%). Statistical analysis revealed that only the presence of peaks of cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the blood within 100 days from BMT was significantly associated with the pattern of GvHD-like changes.\nContext 5: We found that the frequencies of na\u00efve B-cells within the CD19+ population were not significantly different in younger and older CMV-seronegative people. This was also true in CMV-seropositive subjects. The frequencies of late-differentiated B-cells were also not different in CMV-negative elderly and young. However, in marked contrast to the T-cell compartment, this was also true for late differentiated B-cells. Within age groups, the most marked differences in the distribution of B-cells were found in the CD19+CD27+ population. The frequencies of CD27+ B-cells were significantly higher in CMV-seropositive than in CMV-seronegative subjects in all age groups. The frequencies of CD27+ B-cells were also significantly higher in the elderly than in the young. The frequencies of CD27+ B-cells were also significantly higher in CMV-seropositive than in CMV-seronegative subjects in all age groups.

Their mean urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and 24-hour proteinuria were determined during hospitalization. Blood samples were also analyzed. Follow-up data were recorded for 44 patients. A cross-sectional study was then conducted to test the correlation between these parameters and their associations with chronic kidney disease complications. Subsequently, a canonical correlation analysis was employed to assess the correlation between baseline proteinuria and parameters of the Oxford classification. Finally, a prospective observational study was performed to evaluate the association between proteinuria and clinical outcomes. Our study is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, and the registration number is ChiCTR-OCH-14005137.\nContext 3: A strong correlation (r=0.81, p<0.001) was found between the ratio and 24-hour proteinuria except in chronic kidney disease stage 5. First-morning urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios of \u2265125.15, 154.44 and 760.31 mg/g reliably predicted equivalent 24-hour proteinuria 'thresholds' of \u22650.15, 0.3 and 1.0 g/24 h, respectively. In continuous analyses, the albumin-to-creatinine ratio was significantly associated with anemia, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, hypercholesterolemia and higher serum cystatin C. However, higher 24-hour proteinuria was only associated with hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia. Higher tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis scores were also associated with a greater albumin-to-creatinine ratio, as observed in the canonical correlation analysis. Finally, the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and 24-hour proteinuria were associated with renal outcomes in univariate analyses.\nContext 4: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent complication in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is associated with in-hospital and long-term morbidity and mortality.

On initial analysis, there was a significant median difference of 2.0 cm3 (95% CI, 1.2 cm3 to 2.7 cm3) (2-sided P <.0001). However multiple regression analysis of perinatal variables showed that only infants with supratentorial lesions (P =.003) were significantly associated with the reduction in cerebellar volumes. The median cerebellar volumes were the following: supratentorial lesions, 18.9 cm3; no supratentorial lesions, 26.1 cm3; and term infants, 26.9 cm3 (analysis of variance, P <.0001). Hence, there was no significant difference in cerebellar volumes of preterm infants at term-equivalent age in the absence of supratentorial lesions. The median vermal volumes were 0.7 cm3 and were significantly related to cerebellar volumes both in preterm infants with and without lesions and in term-control infants.\nContext 2: The study compared the MR imaging cerebellar volume by using a manual quantification program of 113 preterm infants at term-equivalent age and 15 term-born control infants.\nContext 3: The objective of this study was to determine whether absolute cerebellar volumes differ between term-equivalent preterm infants and term-born control infants and to assess whether cerebellar volume is influenced by any possible antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors.\nContext 4: Traditionally cerebellar functions are thought to be related to control of tone, posture, gait, and coordination of skilled motor activity. However, there is an increasing body of evidence implicating the cerebellum in cognition, language, memory, and motor learning. Preterm infants are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral and emotional disturbances. The role of the cerebellum in these adverse outcomes is unclear.\nContext 5: We evaluated the MR images of 160 preterm infants at term-equivalent age. The presence of DEHSI was evaluated in separate regions and classified into 5 grades based on the extent of DEHSI. We also examined within those infants with DEHSI, whether typical signal-intensity characteristics of the posterior periventricular white matter (PVWM) were present. The cerebellar volumes were measured by using a manual quantification program. The cerebellar volumes were significantly smaller in infants with DEHSI than in those without DEHSI (P <.0001). The cerebellar volumes were significantly smaller in infants with DEHSI than in those without DEHSI in the absence of supratentorial lesions (P =.003). The cerebellar volumes were significantly smaller in infants with DEHSI than in those without DEHSI in the presence of supratentorial lesions (P =.003).

DNA purified from various commercially available dry-state stabilization matrices has been used successfully in downstream molecular applications (e.g., quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], microarray, and sequence-based genotyping). However, standard DNA storage conditions still include freezing of DNA eluted in aqueous buffers or nuclease-free water. Broad implementation of dry-state, long-term DNA storage requires enhancement of such dry-state DNA stabilization products to control for temperature fluctuations at specimen collection, transit, and storage. This study tested the integrity of genomic DNA subjected to long-term storage on GenTegra(\u2122) DNA stabilization matrices (GenTegra LLC, Pleasanton, CA) at extreme conditions, as defined by a 4-year storage period at ambient temperature with an initial incubation for 7 months at 37\u00b0C, 56\u00b0C, or ambient temperature. Subsequently, purified DNA performance and integrity were measured by qPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based human leokocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping.\nContext 2: Does storage time have any impact on the transcriptome of slowly frozen cryopreserved human metaphase II (MII) oocytes?\nContext 3: Fresh blood samples (n = 80) were collected and either processed immediately or after storage for 24 h. The samples were either stored as liquid blood at 4 degrees C or as dried blood spots at ambient temperature on three types of paper-based storage media. The quality of the DNA extracted from the samples was measured.\nContext 4: High molecular weight genomic DNA samples were recovered from the GenTegra product matrix and exhibited integrity comparable to a highly characterized commercial standard under assessment by qPCR. Samples were genotyped for classical HLA loci using next generation sequencing-based methodolgy on the Roche 454 GS Junior instrument. Amplification efficiency, sequence coverage, and sequence quality were all comparable with those produced from a cell line DNA sequenced as a control. No significant differences were observed in the mean, median, or mode quality scores between samples and controls (p\u22650.4).\nContext 5: A consistent and stable source of DNA is an essential requirement for many Biobanks.

Tissue warming during this procedure requires adequate perfusion within the isolated extremity. At our institution, spinal or epidural anesthesia was used to produce sympathetic blockade and vasodilation for lower extremity procedures. More recently, we began using mild systemic hyperthermia to produce active thermoregulatory vasodilation. In the presence of heat stress, sympathetic blockade may actually decrease skin blood flow because active cutaneous vasodilation, which is associated with sweating, is dependent on intact sympathetic innervation. We therefore investigated whether the continued use of neuraxial blockade was justified. Twenty patients undergoing lower extremity perfusions were alternately assigned to receive either combined general and spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia alone. All were aggressively warmed using forced air and circulating water. There were no significant differences in tissue temperatures (measured at four sites in the isolated limb) between groups at any time before or after the start of perfusion. Similarly, pump flow (715 +/- 211 mL/min versus 965 +/- 514 mL/min) and the time required to achieve an average tissue temperature of 39 degrees C (43 +/- 16 vs 34 +/- 13 min) were not different between groups (spinal versus no spinal). Sweating was observed in all but three patients at esophageal temperatures of 37.9 +/- 0.6 degrees C. We conclude that sympathetic blockade confers no added benefit for tissue warming during isolated limb perfusions in the presence of induced mild systemic hyperthermia.\nContext 2: Although forced-air warming rapidly increases intraoperative core temperatures, it is reportedly ineffective postoperatively. A major difference between these two periods is that arteriovenous shunts are usually dilated during surgery, whereas vasoconstriction is uniform in hypothermic postoperative patients. Vasoconstriction may decrease efficacy of warming because its major physiologic purposes are to reduce cutaneous heat transfer and restrict heat transfer between the two thermal compartments. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that thermoregulatory vasoconstriction decreases cutaneous transfer of applied heat and restricts peripheral-to-core flow of heat, thereby delaying and reducing the increase in core temperature.\nContext 3: Cutaneous heat transfer was similar during vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Forced-air warming increased peripheral tissue heat content comparably when the volunteers were vasodilated or vasoconstricted. However, the increase in core temperature was significantly greater during vasoconstriction than during vasodilation. The increase in core temperature was also significantly greater during forced-air warming than during forced-air cooling. These results suggest that vasoconstriction delays and reduces the increase in core temperature during forced-air warming.\nContext 4: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of forced-air warming during lower extremity perfusion would increase the core temperature of the isolated limb. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that forced-air warming would increase the core temperature of the isolated limb.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of forced-air warming during lower extremity perfusion", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Melanoma cases may exist in pancreatic cancer kindreds, whereas there is increased risk of pancreatic cancer in familial melanoma. The two cancers may share genetic susceptibility variants in common.\nContext 2: Three dbGaP (datasets in Genotypes and Phenotypes)-deposited GWAS (genome-wide association study) datasets (MD Anderson melanoma, PanScan 1, and PanScan 2 for pancreatic cancer) were used. Thirty-seven melanoma susceptibility variants in 22 genomic regions from published GWAS, plus melanoma-related genes and pathways were examined for pancreatic cancer risk in the PanScan datasets. Conversely, nine known pancreatic cancer susceptibility variants were examined for melanoma risk in the MD Anderson dataset.\nContext 3: In the PanScan data, initial associations were found with melanoma susceptibility variants in NCOA6 [rs4911442; OR, 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.70; P = 0.03], YWHAZP5 (rs17119461; OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.08-6.35; P = 0.03), and YWHAZP5 (rs17119490; OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.08-6.34; P = 0.03), TYRP1 (P = 0.04), and IFNA13 (P = 0.04). In the melanoma dataset, two pancreatic cancer susceptibility variants were associated: NR5A2 (rs12029406; OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.92; P = 0.04) and CLPTM1L-TERT (rs401681; OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34; P = 0.04). None of these associations remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.\nContext 4: BRCA2 mutations are the well-known cause of inherited susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. However, the true association of BRCA2 mutations with pancreatic cancer may vary among different ethnic groups. As such, we aimed to determine the role of BRCA2 mutations as a risk factor for sporadic and familial pancreatic cancer in Korean patients.\nContext 5: To investigate whether UGT1A7 polymorphisms contribute to the risk of pancreatitis in patients with chronic pancreatitis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs1048943 polymorphism of the UGT1A7 gene and the risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs1048943 polymorphism of the UGT1A7 gene and the risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs1048943 polymorphism of the UGT1A7 gene and the risk of pancreatic cancer in a Chinese population.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs1048943", "Question: Does insertion of laryngeal mask airway increase the intraocular pressure in children with glaucoma??\nExplanation: The insertion of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a safe and effective method of providing anesthesia in children with glaucoma.

In contrast, Skp2 expression was detected in 47.3% (43 of 91) of adenocarcinomas. Positive Skp2 expression was detected significantly more often in adenocarcinomas than in LMP tumors (P < 0.0001) or in adenomas (P < 0.0001). A significantly higher detection rate of Skp2 expression was observed in advanced-stage diseases compared with early-stage diseases (P = 0.010). Log-rank testing showed that Skp2 overexpression was significantly correlated with poor patient survival (P = 0.0035). Older age (P = 0.0026), advanced clinical stage (P < 0.0001), and high histological grades of the tumors (P = 0.0018) were also significantly associated with poor prognoses. In multivariate analysis, Skp2 overexpression (P = 0.0069) and clinical stage (P < 0.0001) remained significantly associated with overall survival, whereas age and histological grade lost their significance. Considerable levels of Skp2 mRNA expression were detected in all ovarian adenocarcinomas examined by semiquantitative PCR.\nContext 3: Skp2 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 134 epithelial ovarian tumors [20 adenomas, 23 low malignant potential (LMP) tumors, and 91 adenocarcinomas]. Results of immunostaining were correlated with clinicopathological variables and overall survival. Skp2 mRNA expression was examined by semiquantitative PCR in 32 ovarian adenocarcinomas and in 3 ovarian cancer cell lines.\nContext 4: The clinical significance of p53 overexpression in patients with ovarian carcinoma is uncertain. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results and have been hampered by small patient populations, failure to account for other well-known prognostic variables in multivariate analysis, and failure to account for the grade of p53 overexpression. The aim of this study was to investigate the independent prognostic significance of p53 overexpression in patients with primary ovarian epithelial cancer (POEC).\nContext 5: KLK4 was found to be overexpressed in 20% of ovarian carcinomas. The expression of KLK4 was significantly higher in advanced stage tumors than in early stage tumors (P = 0.0001). The expression of KLK4 was significantly higher in patients with poor prognosis than in patients with good prognosis (P = 0.0001). The expression of KLK4 was significantly higher in patients with advanced stage tumors than in patients with early stage tumors (P = 0.0001).

Prostate-specific antigen mass density in the metabolic syndrome group was still significantly lower than that in the metabolic syndrome group (0.124 \u00b1 0.084 vs 0.115 \u00b1 0.071 \u03bcg/mL, P = 0.001). After adjusting for age, prostate volume and plasma volume using linear regression model, the presence of metabolic syndrome was a significant independent factor for lower prostate-specific antigen (prostate-specific antigen decrease by 4.1%, P = 0.046).\nContext 3: We retrospectively analyzed 4111 men who underwent routine check-ups including prostate-specific antigen and transrectal ultrasonography. The definition of metabolic syndrome was based on the modified Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Prostate-specific antigen mass density (prostate-specific antigen \u00d7 plasma volume / prostate volume) was calculated for adjusting plasma volume and prostate volume. We compared prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific antigen mass density levels of participants with metabolic syndrome (metabolic syndrome group, n = 1242) and without metabolic syndrome (non-prostate-specific antigen metabolic syndrome group, n = 2869). To evaluate the impact of metabolic syndrome on prostate-specific antigen, linear regression analysis for the natural logarithm of prostate-specific antigen was used.\nContext 4: Patients with prostate cancer had significantly lower plasma adiponectin levels compared with the other two groups, that is BPH patients and healthy controls (7.4 \u00b1 5 ng/mL vs. 11.5 \u00b1 6.4 ng/mL and 12.8 \u00b1 8 ng/mL, respectively). On the other hand, no statistically significant differences were found between patients with prostate cancer and the other two groups for both HOMA-IR and QUICKI (P-value = 0.551). As expected, in all three groups, the levels of adiponectin correlated negatively with HOMA-IR (rho = -0.214, P-value = 0.001) and QUICKI (rho = -0.202, P-value = 0.001). In addition, the levels of adiponectin correlated positively with plasma volume (rho = 0.202, P-value = 0.001) and negatively with prostate volume (rho = -0.202, P-value = 0.001).\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between plasma adiponectin levels and prostate volume in a large cohort of men.

In this randomized controlled trial, we sought to determine whether partner presence during the initiation of epidural analgesia", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Miltefosine inhibited T-cell proliferation in vitro. In the transfer model, miltefosine significantly ameliorated the severity of colitis as measured by clinical, (immuno)histochemical, and biochemical parameters.\nContext 2: The repertoire of immunomodulators that can be used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is limited. The use of these drugs is further restricted by the occurrence of side effects in a proportion of patients. Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) is a lipid drug developed in the 1980s for the treatment of cancer but is nowadays best known for its application in the oral treatment of leishmaniasis. Although the exact mechanism of action of miltefosine has yet to be elucidated, the drug has previously been shown to inhibit phospholipases and protein kinase C, both key components of proproliferative signal transduction in T cells.\nContext 3: Stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte were treated with miltefosine, and proliferation was measured. We use the CD45RB T-cell transfer colitis model to investigate the effect of miltefosine treatment on intestinal inflammation. Effects on the severity of colitis were studied by histochemical and immunohistochemical staining, and cytokine levels were determined using a cytokine bead array.\nContext 4: Mif deficient (Mif(-/-)) and wild-type mice in the C57Bl/6 background were orally infected with T. gondii strain ME49. Mif(-/-) mice had reduced lethality, ileal inflammation and tissue damage despite of an increased intestinal parasite load compared to wt mice. Lack of MIF caused a reduction of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-23 and an increased expression of IL-22 in ileal mucosa. Moreover, suppressed pro-inflammatory responses at the ileal mucosa observed in Mif(-/-) mice was not due to upregulation of IL-4, IL-10 or TGF-\u03b2. MIF also affected the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) but not MMP-2 in the intestine of infected mice. Signs of systemic inflammation including the increased concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and liver damage were less pronounced in Mif(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice.\nContext 5: To determine whether methotrexate has anti-inflammatory activity in refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we treated mice with methotrexate (MTX) and compared the effects of MTX with those of miltefosine (MTX-miltefosine) in a model of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). We found that MTX-miltefosine was more effective than MTX in reducing the severity of colitis and in reducing the number of inflammatory cells in the colon. MTX-miltefosine also reduced the number of CD4+ T cells in the colon. In addition, MTX-miltefosine reduced the number of CD4+ T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. We also found that MTX-milte", "No, pre-bisection of a single skin biopsy does not increase the risk of compromising the specimen for direct immunofluorescence testing.\nThe study by Kato et al.

The binding of GO to the CD33 antigen on leukemic cells results in internalization and subsequent release of calicheamicin, thereby inducing DNA strand breaks. We hypothesized that the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib might inhibit DNA repair initiated by GO-induced DNA strand breaks, thereby increasing cytotoxicity.\nContext 2: We have recently shown that fenretinide preferentially targets CD34(+) cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and here, we test whether this agent exerts the effect on CD34(+) cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which are refractory to imatinib.\nContext 3: The 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were 24 ng/ml for HL-60 cells and 550 ng/ml for GO-resistant variant HL/GO20 cells. HL/GO20 cells were also refractory to GO-induced apoptosis. CD33 positivity was reduced in HL/GO20 cells. Olaparib-alone did not inhibit the cell growth and did not induce apoptosis in either HL-60 cells or HL/GO20 cells at concentrations of up to 10 \u03bcM. When cells were treated with different concentrations of GO in the presence of 10 \u03bcM olaparib, the IC50 of GO for HL-60 cells was 13 ng/ml. The combination index was 0.86, indicating synergistic cytotoxicity of GO and olaparib in combination. Such a combination was ineffective for HL/GO20 cells.\nContext 4: Eight (47%) of the 17 patients with AML had complete hematologic remissions (four after the initial course of 2-CDA), and two (12%) had partial remissions, for a total response rate of 59%. Only one child with ALL achieved remission. Seven of the responding patients underwent allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation, with six remaining free of leukemia for a median of 7 months (range, 1 to 11 months). The major form of drug-induced toxicity was hematologic, with severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (National Cancer Institute [NCI] grade 3 or 4) developing in 34 of the 36 courses of 2-CDA. The median duration of neutropenia was 5 days (range, 1 to 14 days). The median duration of thrombocytopenia was 7 days (range, 1 to 14 days). The median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 5 days (range, 1 to 14 days). The median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 5 days (range, 1 to 14 days). The median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 5 days (range, 1 to 14 days).

However, the role of M2-polarized macrophages in the growth and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma remains enigmatic. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of M2 macrophages on the proliferation and migration of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells and tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis.\nContext 2: In the co-culture Transwell system, the proliferation and migration of Lewis cells were promoted by M2 macrophages. Moreover, the co-culture significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C by Lewis cells and reduced the secretion of nitric oxide from M2 macrophages, which subsequently led to the capillary morphogenesis of lymphatic endothelial cells. Interestingly, following co-culture with Lewis cells, the function of RAW264.7 cells was polarized toward that of the M2 macrophage phenotype.\nContext 3: Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and its receptor, VEGFR-3, have been implicated as important factors in the formation of lymphatic vessels and recent evidence suggests that tumor lymphangiogenesis promotes lymphatic metastasis.\nContext 4: Clinical data showed that compared with the baseline MLR before rhES treatment, patients with progressive disease had higher MLRs than those of patients with partial response. Experimental results showed that more macrophages were recruited in the LLC tumors after rhES treatment and the majority of them displayed an M2-like phenotype. rhES aggravated hypoxia and the inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia promoted the expression of CCL2 by endothelial and fibroblast cells, which could induce macrophages recruitment, and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-4 [IL-4], IL-6, and IL-10) skewed macrophage polarization toward the M2-like phenotype. Hypoxia or inflammation cytokine-treated macrophages enhanced the progression of LLC in vitro and in vivo.\nContext 5: Angiogenesis is essential for tumors to grow and metastasize. Lymphatic metastasis is also an important means of tumor spread. In non-small cell lung carcinoma, the relationship of lymphangiogenesis with lymph node metastasis and, ultimately, patient prognosis is unknown.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a clear and concise answer to the question.

Various doses of the substances administered intraperitoneally were characterized for their ability to elevate the threshold for clonic seizures induced by intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and for protection against tonic seizures induced by subcutaneous bolus administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The inverted-screen test was used to assess acute neurological toxicity.\nContext 5: Acetone (1-32 mmol/kg, i.p.), in a dose-dependent fashion, elevated the PTZ threshold and conferred protection against 4-AP seizures (ED(50), 26.3 mmol/kg). Effective doses of acetone (10-32 mmol/kg) did not cause motor impairment in the inverted-screen test (TD(50), 45.7 mmol/kg). In doses 10-fold greater than the minimally effective dose of acetone (3.2 mmol/kg), the metabolites acetol, 1,2-propanediol, and pyruvic acid were inactive in the PTZ model. At higher doses that produced motor impairment, acetol and 1,2-propanediol (but not pyruvic acid) did elevate the PTZ threshold. Methylglyoxal had both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant actions, and had substantial toxicity, producing respiratory distress, motor impairment, and death. None of the acetone metabolites protected against 4-AP seizures.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\nContext 1: To investigate whether pre- and post-drug magnetic field (MF) exposure of 50 Hz, 0.2 mT has any significant effect on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice.\nContext 2: The aim of this work was to study the effects of prolonged exposure to lead on the threshold of experimental seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ).\nContext 3: Neither pre- nor post-drug exposure to a 50 Hz, 0.2 mT MF was found to have any effect on PTZ-induced epileptic seizures or mortality rates in mice.\nContext 4: Acetone and its major metabolites", "Question: Does alcohol seeking by rats become habitual after prolonged training??\nExplanation: The results of this study suggest that alcohol seeking by rats becomes habitual after prolonged training.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in mediating cardiac fibroblast (CF) function and cardiac fibrosis. Recent data suggested that microRNA-101a (miR-101a) exerted anti-fibrotic effects in post-infarct cardiac remodeling and improved cardiac function. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between hypoxia, miR-101a and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in CFs.\nContext 2: Two weeks following coronary artery occlusion in rats, the expression levels of both TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b2RI were increased, but the expression of miR-101a was decreased at the site of the infarct and along its border. Cultured rat neonatal CFs treated with hypoxia were characterized by the up-regulation of TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b2RI and the down-regulation of miR-101a. Delivery of miR-101a mimics significantly suppressed the expression of TGF\u03b2RI and p-Smad 3, CF differentiation and collagen content of CFs. These anti-fibrotic effects were abrogated by co-transfection with AMO-miR-101a, an antisense inhibitor of miR-101a. The repression of TGF\u03b2RI, a target of miR-101a, was validated by luciferase reporter assays targeting the 3'UTR of TGF\u03b2RI. Additionally, we found that overexpression of miR-101a reversed the improved migration ability of CFs and further reduced CF proliferation caused by hypoxia.\nContext 3: Cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Altered expression of several genes and their regulation by microRNAs has been reported in hypertrophied failing hearts. This study aims to examine the role of Cdc42, Pak1, and miR-30c in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy in DCM.\nContext 4: MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally control gene expression. Small-animal studies suggest that miRs might offer novel therapeutic targets in cardiovascular diseases such as cardioprotection of murine hearts after myocardial infarction via miR-92a inhibitors. However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-92a in cardiac hypertrophy remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-92a in cardiac hypertrophy.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-30c in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in a mouse model of chronic heart failure (CHF). We found that miR-30c was downregulated in the failing hearts of CHF mice. In vitro, miR-30c inhibited the expression of cardiac hypertrophy-related genes, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and collagen I. In vivo, miR-30", "Yes, the direction of the Whitacre needle affects the spread of hyperbaric bupivacaine in parturients undergoing elective caesarean section.

Here, we demonstrated that long-term exposure to fractionated radiation conferred acquired radioresistance to tumor cells due to AKT-mediated enhanced aerobic glycolysis.\nContext 2: Enhanced aerobic glycolysis was shown by increased glucose transporter Glut1 expression and a high lactate production rate in acquired radioresistant cells compared with parental cells. Inhibiting the AKT pathway using the AKT inhibitor API-2 abrogated these phenomena. Moreover, we found that inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxy", "Question: Does carbohydrate supplementation blunt the prolonged exercise-induced reduction of in vivo immunity??\nExplanation: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of carbohydrate supplementation on differentiated and undifferentiated ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during prolonged intermittent exercise and recovery.\nThe study was conducted in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Twenty-four healthy male subjects (age 22.5 \u00b1 1.5 years, body mass index 23.5 \u00b1 1.5 kg/m2) were recruited.

The AR is expressed in prostate cancer cells and is upregulated in response to androgen stimulation. The AR is also expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The AR is a member of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The trend of bronchoprotection was wavy in drug interventional groups, which initially increased and then decreased. Chronic treatment with formoterol significantly impaired bronchoprotection. According to the morphometric analysis and \u03b1-actin expression, no significant difference was detected in smooth muscle mass in all groups.\nContext 2: Inhaling \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist is first-line asthma treatment, which is used for both acute relief of and prevention of bronchoconstriction. However, chronic use of \u03b2-agonists results in impaired bronchoprotection and increasing occurrences of severe asthma exacerbation, even death in clinical practice. The mechanism of \u03b2-adrenoceptor hyposensitivity has not been thoroughly elucidated thus far. Bronchial smooth muscle contraction induces airway narrowing and also mediates airway inflammation. Moreover, bronchial smooth muscle mass significantly increases in asthmatics. We aim to establish an asthmatic model that demonstrated that formoterol induced impaired bronchoprotection and to see whether increased smooth muscle mass play a role in it.\nContext 3: We combined routine allergen challenging (seven weeks) with repeated application of formoterol, formoterol plus budesonide or physiological saline in allergen-sensitized BALB/c mouse. The bronchoprotection mediated by \u03b2-agonist was measured in five consecutive weeks. Smooth muscle mass was shown by morphometric analysis, and \u03b1-actin expression was detected by western blot.\nContext 4: Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) cells from asthmatic patients maintain in vitro a distinct hyper-reactive (\"primed\") phenotype, characterized by increased release of pro-inflammatory factors and mediators, as well as hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy. This \"primed\" phenotype helps to understand pathogenesis of asthma, as changes in BSM function are essential for manifestation of allergic and inflammatory responses and airway wall remodelling.\nContext 5: Spacers and valved holding chambers (VHCs) were developed to facilitate using pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) by patients who could not coordinate the actions required for successful pMDI use. There is little in vivo evidence about how VHC may affect the bronchodilation from combination drugs in pMDI. This study was to determine the effect, if any, of VHC on the bronchodilating actions of the pMDI budesonide/formoterol combination.\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that the combination of budesonide/formoterol in pMDI is not inferior to the combination of budesonide/formoterol in VHC in terms of bronchodilation. However, the combination of budesonide/formoterol in pMDI is inferior to the combination of budesonide/formoterol in VHC in terms of bronchial smooth muscle mass.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: A total of 3050 participants were randomized into three treatment groups: intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin and placebo. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 autoantibodies and insulinoma-associated-2 autoantibodies were measured at baseline and participants were followed for 3.2 years for the development of diabetes.\nContext 2: Among patients not classified as Type 1 diabetes, 52 (47%) of Type 2 and 42 (59%) of unclassified patients were positive for islet cell antibodies (ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) or tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA-2A). These patients (n=94) had lower body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001) and lower C-peptide (p<0.001) compared to the autoantibody negative patients (n=87). Compared to clinically classified Type 1 diabetes patients positive for autoantibodies (n=477), they have higher BMI (p<0.001), higher C-peptide (p<0.001) and the same levels of ICA, GADA and IA-2A. After 3 years, 93% of autoantibody positive patients initially not classified as Type 1 were on insulin. When ICA, GADA, IA-2A, BMI and C-peptide were tested in a multiple logistic regression, only GADA was significant for insulin treatment within 3 years (OR=18.8; 95% CI 1.8-191) in patients treated with diet or oral drugs at diagnosis.\nContext 3: This investigation was based on a nationwide study (Diabetes Incidence Study in Sweden) of 15-34-year-old newly diagnosed diabetic subjects. During 1992-1993, all diabetic subjects (excluding secondary and gestational diabetes) were reported on standardized forms, with information about clinical characteristics at diagnosis. The study examined islet cell antibodies (ICA) by indirect immunofluorescence, and autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), tyrosine phosphatase-like antigen (IA-2A) and insulin (IAA) as well as C-peptide by radioimmunoassay.\nContext 4: The role of glucokinase (GCK) in the pathogenesis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young is well established. However, the role of GCK autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes is less clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of GCK autoantibodies in patients with Type 1 diabetes and to compare the prevalence of GCK autoantibodies in patients with Type 1 diabetes with and without islet cell antibodies (ICA).\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of GCK autoantibodies in patients with Type 1 diabetes and to compare the prevalence of GCK autoantibodies in patients with Type 1 diabetes with and without islet cell antibodies (ICA).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Previous studies have suggested that the sum of Attention, Aggression, and Anxious/Depressed subscales of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-PBD; pediatric bipolar disorder phenotype) may be specific to pediatric bipolar disorder (BP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the CBCL and CBCL-PBD to identify BP in children <12 years old.\nContext 2: A sample of children with BP I, II, and not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 157) ascertained through the Course and Outcome for Bipolar Disorder in Youth (COBY) study were compared with a group of children with major depressive/anxiety disorders (MDD/ANX; n = 101), disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) (n = 127), and healthy control (HC) (n = 128). The CBCL T-scores and area under the curve (AUC) scores were calculated and compared among the above-noted groups.\nContext 3: Prepubertal children and early adolescents with bipolar disorders (PEA-BP) who participate in the ongoing study \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" have a high prevalence of ultradian (within 24-hour periods) rapid cycling. Based on a case-control finding reported in bipolar (BP) adults of an association between rapid and ultradian rapid cycling with the low-activity allele of catechol-O-methyltransferase (l-COMT), study of linkage and linkage disequilibrium of l-COMT in the PEA-BP population seemed warranted.\nContext 4: As part of an ongoing, larger study, \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolarity\", a subset of prepubertal and early adolescent onset bipolar (PEA-BP) probands, on whom trio blood collection was complete, were used to study genetic transmission of the serotonin transporter linked promoter region (HTTLPR) short and long alleles using the transmission disequilibrium test(TDT). The HTTLPR alleles were selected based on postulated serotonergic mechanisms for PEA-BP and on the burgeoning number of HTTLPR allele studies in bipolar (BP) adults.\nContext 5: Children and adolescents were assessed by the K-SADS-PL and a clinical evaluation for BD and comorbid conditions. Manic and depressive symptoms were assessed with the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Children Depression Rating Scale - Reviewed. The Val66Met polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and bipolar disorder (BD) in a sample of 1,000 children and adolescents. The 5-HTTLPR was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and bipolar disorder (BD) in a sample of 1,000 children and adolescents. The 5-HTTLPR was genot", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Biliary pain is generally treated with NSAIDs and spasmolytics, but some patients do not tolerate them. Nifedipine has been suggested to have some analgesic effect and it has been used successfully in many painful smooth muscle disorders. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of nifedipine for biliary colics and gallbladder volume.\nContext 2: Twenty-seven patients suffering from uncomplicated symptomatic gallbladder stones were prospectively randomized to receive either oral nifedipine (10 mg 3 times daily) or placebo in a double-blind manner. Liver chemistry and ultrasonography were examined before and after the 8-week study period. The patients completed each day a diary of their pain, headache, palpitation, burning feeling in skin, dizziness, and their use of painkillers.\nContext 3: Biliary pain seemed to be less intensive and shorter in duration, but without statistical significance, whereas headache tended to be more common (p = 0.077) in nifedipine group than that in placebo group. This difference would have reached statistical significance with over 155 patients randomized. Overall additional drug use was similar in both groups, and was increased in nifedipine group for headache (p = 0.05). The fasting gallbladder volume tended to decrease (p = 0.085) during the nifedipine treatment but not with placebo. Serum liver chemistry remained within normal range.\nContext 4: Chronic acalculous gallbladder disease (CAGD) falls within the spectrum of diseases associated with gallbladder dysmotility. Cholecystokinin-cholescintigraphy (CCK-CS) has been used to evaluate for CAGD, with a gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) of <35\u00a0% being indicative of gallbladder dysfunction. The reproduction of biliary colic upon administration of CCK has been cited as indicative of CAGD. Our purpose was to determine whether low GBEF or reproduction of pain during CCK-CS was predictor of surgical outcomes related to resolution of symptoms or as a correlate to gallbladder pathology.\nContext 5: Bile was sampled during operations through puncture of the gallbladder from 145 cholesterol gallstone patients, 23 patients with pigment stones and 87 gallstone free patients undergoing cholecystectomy. Biliary lipid composition, cholesterol saturation, bile acid composition, nucleic acid content and bile flow were determined.

In the retina, a common underlying mechanism involves mitochondrial dysfunction since photoreceptor homeostasis and survival are highly susceptible to altered aerobic energy metabolism. We sought to develop an assay to directly measure oxygen consumption in intact retina with the goal of identifying alterations in respiration during photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration.\nContext 2: We show that glucose is an essential substrate for retinal mitochondria. At baseline, mitochondria respiration in the intact wild-type retina was close to maximal, with limited reserve capacity. Similar OCR and limited mitochondrial reserve capacity was also observed in cone-only Nrl-/- retina. However, the retina of Pde6brd1/rd1, Cep290rd16/rd16 and Rpgrip1-/- mice, all with dysfunctional or no photoreceptors, had reduced OCR and higher mitochondrial reserve capacity.\nContext 3: Circular punches of freshly isolated mouse retina, adjacent to the optic nerve head, were used in the microplate-based Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer to measure oxygen consumption. Tissue integrity was evaluated by propidium iodide staining and live imaging. Different substrates were tested for mitochondrial respiration. Basal and maximal respiration were expressed as oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and respectively measured in Ames' medium before and after the addition of mitochondrial uncoupler, BAM15.\nContext 4: To test this hypothesis, we prepared experimental animal models in which oxidative stress could be applied to the retina. In the present study, we examined ADF expression in the rat retina using temporary ischemia and reperfusion, and photodynamic retinal vascular thrombosis by immunohistochemical and Western blotting methods.\nContext 5: Two mouse lines were generated harboring a cyclization recombinase (CRE)-mediated knockdown of EpoR in rod photoreceptors (EpoR(flox/flox);Opn-Cre) or in a heterogeneous cell population of the retinal periphery (EpoR(flox/flox);\u03b1-Cre). The function of the retina was measured with electroretinography. Retinal morphology was analyzed in tissue sections. The vasculature of the retina was investigated on flatmount preparations, cryosections, and fluorescein angiography. Retinal nuclear layers were isolated by laser capture microdissection to test for EpoR expression. Gene expression analysis was performed with semiquantitative real-time PCR.\nContext 6: We show that the retinal vasculature is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the retina. We demonstrate that the retinal vasculature is a major source of ROS in the retina. We show that the retinal vasculature is a major source of ROS in the retina.

Regression model analysis controlling for demographic differences revealed that breastfeeding was significantly associated with a higher perception of severity of illness and higher confidence in the ability of health care to prevent illness. Breastfeeding mothers were less likely to reverse parent-child roles and had a lower perception of hassle from their infant's behavior. When comparing mothers who breastfed longer than 8 weeks to those who did not breastfeed, breastfeeding mothers had high scores related to empathy toward infants on the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory as well as a low perception of hassle on the Parenting Daily Hassle. The perception of existing formal or informal social support did not influence breastfeeding behavior.\nContext 3: A total of 1798 mothers were eligible for analysis, (n=250 re-admitted, 1548 non-re-admitted). Seventy three per cent (n=1315) reported predominant breastfeeding at 2 months. Infant re-admission (adjusted OR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.55) and late preterm birth were not associated with discontinuation of predominant breastfeeding. The odds of predominantly breastfeeding were two times greater, if mothers' perceptions of talking about breastfeeding with a healthcare provider were positive versus negative. Whereas the odds were decreased for primiparous women (adjusted OR 0.61 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78) and not impacted for multiparous women (OR 0.60 95% CI 0.32 to 1.13) with a negative versus neutral perception of the breastfeeding talk experience.\nContext 4: To evaluate the impact of promotion of exclusive breastfeeding on infant health in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, where mortality rates are high, breastfeeding is widely practiced but exclusive breastfeeding is rare.\nContext 5: In a previous study, an intervention that included a process-oriented program on breastfeeding counseling for health professionals and continuity in family classes through childbirth was conducted. The 10 largest municipalities were classified in pairs that were similar in size and had similar figures of breastfeeding duration. The municipalities were randomized pairwise to either an intervention or a control group. The present study is a follow-up study on women's feelings for their infants in relation to the kind of care that they had had and was undertaken between April 2008 and March 2009.\nContext 6: The study was conducted in 2008 in the city of Dakar, Senegal.

The authors concluded that the decreased EPCs in SLE patients might be associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in SLE patients.\nContext 1: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to vascular regeneration and repair, thereby protecting against atherosclerotic disease. EPCs are derived from CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSC", "Question: Do titanium dioxide nanoparticles promote arrhythmias via a direct interaction with rat cardiac tissue??\nExplanation: The answer is no.

Further, using macrophage-selective LXR-deficient mice created by bone marrow transplantation, we provide the first evidence that macrophage LXR expression is necessary for the atheroprotective actions of an LXR agonist.\nContext 2: Complications of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to elevated blood cholesterol levels are the major cause of death in the Western world. The liver X receptors, LXRalpha and LXRbeta (LXRs), are ligand-dependent transcription factors that act as cholesterol sensors and coordinately control transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis as well as macrophage inflammatory gene expression. LXRs regulate cholesterol balance through activation of ATP-binding cassette transporters that promote cholesterol transport and excretion from the liver, intestine, and macrophage. Although LXR agonists are known to delay progression of atherosclerosis in mouse models, their ability to abrogate preexisting cardiovascular disease by inducing regression and stabilization of established atherosclerotic lesions has not been addressed.\nContext 3: The activated pregnane X receptor is antifibrogenic in rodent chronic liver injury in vivo models. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of human pregnane X receptor activators on human hepatic stellate cell transdifferentiation to a profibrogenic phenotype in vitro.\nContext 4: Liver X receptors (LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2) are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate expression of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. LXR expression has been identified in human and rodent cardiac tissue, however, its role in this tissue remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of in vivo LXR activation on lipid metabolism in the rat myocardium under the conditions of low and high lipid intake.\nContext 5: Liver X receptor (LXR) agonists slow atherogenesis, but cause hepatic steatosis and dysfunction in part by increasing expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1-c (SREBP1-c), a transcription factor that upregulates fatty acid (FA) synthesis. n-3 FAs decrease hepatic FA synthesis by down-regulating SREBP1-c. To test the hypothesis that n-3 FAs decrease hepatic SREBP1-c expression by inhibiting LXR activation, we examined the effects of n-3 FAs on LXR activation and SREBP1-c expression in cultured human hepatocytes.\nContext 6: The liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates cholesterol and lipid metabolism. LXR activation by its ligands, such as 9-cis retinoic acid, induces the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LXR activation on the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism in human hepatocytes.\nContext 7: The liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates cholesterol and lipid", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Recent studies have demonstrated that stimulating autoantibodies against the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R-AA) are frequently detected in the sera from women with preeclampsia, suggesting that they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Nevertheless, the real clinical significance of AT1R-AA in preeclampsia is still controversial due to the paucity of appropriate large comparative studies that require cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive bioassays to detect AT1R-AA. At present, the prevalence of AT1R-AA in large populations of preeclamptic women is unknown. In an attempt to clarify this issue, we assessed the presence and potential clinical significance of AT1R-AA in a large population of Mexican-Mestizo women with preeclampsia.\nContext 2: We found that IgG obtained from sera of healthy pregnant women and patients with preeclampsia were unable to induce luciferase activity in both HEK-293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing functional angiotensin II receptor type 1. Therefore, the frequency of patients with AT1R-AA was zero.\nContext 3: Urotensin-II (UTS-II) may be associated with preeclampsia. We therefore assessed whether the UTS-II 143 G/A polymorphism is associated with preeclampsia in Korean women.\nContext 4: Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is a common vascular pregnancy disorder associated with high maternal and infant mortality and morbidity worldwide. The role of Activin A and more recently type 2 Activin A receptor (ACVR2A) in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia has been the subject of genetic and biochemical research with controversial results.\nContext 5: 1258 women were included (233 with insulin-dependent diabetes, 387 with chronic hypertension, 315 with a multiple gestation, 323 with previous preeclampsia). Multiple early pregnancy serum biomarkers differed between women who did and did not develop preeclampsia. Each high-risk group had a unique and largely nonoverlapping pattern of biomarker abnormality. Differences between those who did and did not develop preeclampsia were noted in vascular cell adhesion molecule in the diabetes group; human chorionic gonadotropin, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, selectin and angiogenin in the hypertension group; and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-2, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, soluble interleukin-6, soluble interleukin-8 receptor, soluble interleukin-10 receptor, soluble interleukin-12 receptor, soluble interleukin-13 receptor, soluble interleukin-15 receptor, soluble interleukin-17 receptor, soluble interleukin-18 receptor, soluble interleukin-21 receptor, soluble interleukin-22 receptor, soluble interleukin-23 receptor, soluble interleukin-24 receptor, soluble interleukin-25 receptor, soluble interleukin-26 receptor, soluble interleukin-27 receptor", "#1: Yes, remote ischaemic preconditioning of the hind limb reduces experimental liver warm ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n#2: No, remote ischaemic preconditioning of the hind limb does not reduce experimental liver warm ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n#3: Maybe, remote ischaemic preconditioning of the hind limb does not reduce experimental liver warm ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n#4: No, remote ischaemic preconditioning of the hind limb does not reduce experimental liver warm ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n#5: Yes, remote ischaemic preconditioning of the hind limb reduces experimental liver warm ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n#6: No, remote ischa", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In a double-blind, randomized phase III study, breast cancer patients suffering from hot flashes at least twice a day, who were not taking any medication against hypertension and depression received either clonidine 0.075 mg twice a day or venlafaxine 37.5 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. The primary end point was defined as the frequency of hot flashes after 4 weeks of treatment. A self-reported 1-week hot flash and other symptom questionnaire were kept before the start of treatment until the end of treatment course.\nContext 2: From April 2002 to October 2004, 80 patients were recruited of whom 64 were assessable for efficacy analyses. Thirty-three received clonidine and 31 venlafaxine, nine patients stopped early because of side-effects and seven withdrew consent. At the end of treatment week 4, the median hot flash frequency dropped by 7.6 hot flashes per day for patients receiving venlafaxine and 4.85 hot flashes per day for those receiving clonidine (P = 0.025).\nContext 3: Classical hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes is contraindicated in breast cancer especially in endocrine responsive disease.\nContext 4: Tamoxifen has dramatically reduced the recurrence and mortality rate of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. However, the efficacy of tamoxifen varies between individuals and 40% of patients will have a recurrence despite adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Factors that predict tamoxifen efficacy would be helpful for optimizing treatment. Serum concentrations of the active metabolite, endoxifen, may be positively related to treatment outcome. In addition, hot flashes are suggested to be positively associated with tamoxifen treatment outcome.\nContext 5: After the test dose injections, HR and SBP increased with or without clonidine premedication. The 95% confidence intervals for the maximum HR increases with and without clonidine were 49-61 and 44-54 beats/min, respectively, indicating that one could not be absolutely certain that everyone would develop a positive HR response. The HR increase was > or = 20 beats/min in 18 of 18 volunteers given epinephrine with or without clonidine and in 0 of 18 volunteers given saline. Calculated sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values were all 100% based on the conventional HR criterion and were unaltered by clonidine. Subjective ratings of HR increase were 100% sensitive and 100% specific. The HR increase was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a HR increase > or = 20 beats/min. The HR increase was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a HR increase > or = 30 beats/min. The HR increase was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a HR increase > or = 40 beats/min. The HR increase was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a HR increase > or = 50 beats/min. The HR increase was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a HR increase > or = 60 beats/min. The HR increase was 100% sensitive and", "Yes, tasks of attention augment rigidity in mild Parkinson disease.\nExplanation: Rigidity is a common motor feature of Parkinson disease (PD). Rigidity is thought to be due to a loss of inhibitory control of the basal ganglia, which is responsible for well-learned movements.

In addition, rigidity is thought to be due to a loss of inhibitory control of the frontal lobes, which is responsible for well-learned movements. Rigidity is also thought to be due to a loss of inhibitory control of the cerebellum, which is", "Contexts:\nContext 1: A novel approach to gene selection is proposed based on kernel similarities and kernel weights. We do not assume uniformity for subject contribution. Weights are calculated via regularized least squares support vector regression (RLS-SVR) of class levels on kernel similarities and are used to weight subject contribution. The cumulative sum of weighted expression levels are next ranked to select responsible genes. These procedures also work for multiclass classification. We demonstrate this algorithm on acute leukemia, colon cancer, small, round blue cell tumors of childhood, breast cancer, and lung cancer studies, using kernel Fisher discriminant analysis and support vector machines as classifiers. Other procedures are compared as well.\nContext 2: In this study, we built a model that uses support vector machine (SVM) to classify cancer and normal samples using Affymetrix exon microarray data obtained from 90 samples of 48 patients diagnosed with CRC. From the 22,011 genes, we selected the 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 genes most relevant to CRC using the minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRMR) technique. With these gene sets, an SVM model was designed using four different kernel types (linear, polynomial, radial basis function [RBF], and sigmoid).\nContext 3: We present systematic feature selection methods that assess the contribution of genome-wide data sets to predict protein functions and then investigate the relationship between genomic data sources and protein functions. In this study, we use ten different genomic data sources in Mus musculus, including: protein-domains, protein-protein interactions, gene expressions, phenotype ontology, phylogenetic profiles and disease data sources to predict protein functions that are labelled with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. We then apply two approaches to feature selection: exhaustive search feature selection using a kernel based logistic regression (KLR), and a kernel based L1-norm regularized logistic regression (KL1LR). In the first approach, we exhaustively measure the contribution of each data set for each function based on its prediction quality. In the second approach, we use the estimated coefficients of features as measures of contribution of data sources. Our results show that the proposed methods improve the prediction quality compared to the full integration of all data sources and other filter-based feature selection methods. We also show that contributing data sources can differ depending on the protein function. Furthermore, we observe that highly contributing data sets can be similar among a group of protein functions that have similar biological processes.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Both intrathecal sufentanil (ITS) and intrathecal morphine (ITM) improve analgesia in obstetrical or cardiac procedures. From a pharmacokinetic standpoint, combining these two opioids may improve perioperative analgesia. We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study to compare the analgesic efficacy of ITM alone vs a mixture of a low dose of ITS plus ITM for perioperative pain relief in colorectal surgery.\nContext 2: Sixty adult patients undergoing open colorectal surgery were randomly assigned to receive either remifentanil or 70% nitrous oxide along with isoflurane anesthesia. After morphine analgesia titration in the postanesthesia care unit, patient-controlled analgesia was commenced. Morphine consumption and pain were scored at rest and during cough or movement for 24 h.\nContext 3: Eighty adult patients undergoing colorectal surgery were randomly allocated to receive either 0.4 mg ITM alone or 10 microg ITS plus 0.4 mg ITM before general anesthesia. Intraoperative intravenous sufentanil consumption, postoperative morphine consumption delivered with a patient controlled analgesia device, pain scores, patient satisfaction and adverse effects were recorded for the first 48 hr postoperatively.\nContext 4: Remifentanil is commonly used to replace nitrous oxide in general anesthesia to avoid the side effects of the latter. However, there are reports that intraoperative remifentanil infusion can lead to acute opioid tolerance. In this study, the authors tried to determine the dose of remifentanil comparable in efficacy to 70% nitrous oxide and to evaluate its effect on postoperative pain and morphine consumption after colorectal surgery using isoflurane anesthesia.\nContext 5: Forty-three male patients undergoing radical prostectomy were randomized to receive either 3 microg x kg(-1) clonidine or placebo po 90 min prior to surgery. All patients received isobaric 15 mg bupivacaine and intrathecal 5 microg x kg morphine, followed by a standardized general anesthetic, consisting of thiopental, sufentanil, rocuronium, isoflurane, oxygen and air. Postoperatively, PCA morphine use and visual analogue pain scores were recorded for the first 48 hr. The incidence and severity of side effects such as sedation, nausea, and vomiting were also recorded.\nContext 6: Forty patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to receive either 0.4 mg ITM or 10 microg ITS plus 0.4 mg ITM.

The pathogenic domain of mutant htt interacts with nuclear transcription factors, and it potentially modulates TP53-induced transcriptional events. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resulting in the R72P exchange in TP53 protein might modulate the variation in AO. In addition, also the R196K replacement in human caspase activated DNase (hCAD) may theoretically affect the AO.\nContext 2: The YAC128 model of Huntington's disease (HD) shows substantial deficits in motor, learning and memory tasks and alterations in its transcriptional profile. We examined the changes in the transcriptional profile in the YAC128 mouse model of HD at 6, 12 and 18\u00a0months and compared these with those seen in other models and human HD caudate.\nContext 3: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fully penetrant, autosomal dominantly inherited disorder associated with abnormal expansions of a stretch of perfect CAG repeats in the 5' part of the IT15 gene. The number of repeat units is highly predictive for the age at onset (AO) of the disorder. But AO is only modestly correlated with repeat length when intermediate HD expansions are considered. Circumstantial evidence suggests that additional features of the HD course are based on genetic traits. Therefore, it may be possible to investigate the genetic background of HD, i.e. to map the loci underlying the development and progression of the disease. Recently an association of Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 1 (GSTO1) and possibly of GSTO2 with AO was demonstrated for, both, Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).\nContext 4: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG triplet repeat tract in the huntingtin gene. While the length of this CAG expansion is the major determinant of the age of onset (AO), other genetic factors have also been shown to play a modulatory role. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammations is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of HD, and that targeting this process may have important therapeutic ramifications. The human \u03b2-defensin 2 (hBD2) is a member of the \u03b2-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides, which are produced by the immune system and are involved in the innate immune response. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of hBD2 in the brain of patients with HD and to determine whether the expression of hBD2 is altered in the brains of patients with HD compared to age-matched controls.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the human \u03b2-defensin 2 (hBD2) in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and to determine whether the expression of hBD2 is altered in the brains of patients with HD compared to age-matched controls.\nContext 6:", "Question: Are zinc and copper supplementation cost-effective interventions in the treatment of acute diarrhea??\nExplanation: Zinc and copper supplementation can be cost-effective interventions in the treatment of acute diarrhea.

The efficacy of such treatment, so far solely evaluated by open study, needed to be confirmed.\nContext 2: Sixty-four children undergoing urological surgery were randomized into two groups: fentanyl in ropivacaine (fentanyl group, n=32) and sufentanil in ropivacaine (sufentanil group, n=32). After anaesthesia, an epidural catheter was inserted at the L2-3, L3-4 or L4-5 interspace. For post-operative pain relief, a solution consisting of fentanyl 0.1 mcg/kg/ml or sufentanil 0.015 mcg/kg/ml in 1.5 mg/ml ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 ml/h. To assess post-operative pain, the faces pain scale and the face, legs, activity, cry, consolability score were recorded at 1, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after surgery. The incidence of adverse effects such as hypoxia, sedation, pruritus, nausea and/or vomiting was also evaluated.\nContext 3: After parental informed consent was obtained, 80 children requiring Cohen cross-trigonal reimplantation were considered for inclusion in a double-blind study. On the day of surgery patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.04 mg./kg. morphine per hour or placebo (normal saline) at a constant intravesical infusion rate of 0.08 ml./kg. per hour. Postoperative pain was assessed every 3 hours using a pain score adapted to patient age. If the score was above a predefined limit, patients received intravenous acetaminophen and nalbuphine alternately every 3 hours. Bladder infusion was discontinued after 48 hours.\nContext 4: We performed a prospective double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that compared 3 parallel groups: the CONT group did not receive any block, the PRE group received bilateral superficial cervical plexus block before surgery while under general anesthesia, and the POST group received bilateral superficial cervical plexus block after surgery while under general anesthesia.

Serum albumin levels were within reference range for all patients and there was no significant relationship between albumin and baseline ischemia-modified albumin or postischemic ischemia-modified albumin.\nContext 3: We examined the ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) level during exercise in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\nContext 4: We evaluated ischemia-modified albumin in patients undergoing intracoronary ergonovine spasm provocation test (n=26). For additional comparison, ischemia-modified albumin was also evaluated in elective percutaneous coronary intervention patients (n=18) and in patients with normal coronary angiography (n=10). Blood samples were taken from the radial artery before and after the test.\nContext 5: IMA levels were significantly higher in patients with positive provocation test compared with baseline [n=16, 106.0 (interquartile range 96.5, 115.5) versus 128.5 (114.8, 171.8) U/ml, P<0.001], whereas it did not change in patients with negative provocation test [n=10, 109.5 (103.3, 115.0) versus 113.5 (104.0, 118.3) U/ml, P=0.108]. IMA was also higher after percutaneous coronary intervention [113.5 (101.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The luteal phase after ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is insufficient. Therefore, luteal phase supplementation is routinely applied in IVF. It may be postulated that premature luteolysis after ovarian hyperstimulation is due to supraphysiological steroid levels in the early luteal phase. In the present study, high doses of steroids are administered after the LH surge in normo-ovulatory volunteers in order to investigate whether this intervention gives rise to endocrine changes and a shortening of the luteal phase.\nContext 2: Early luteal phase steroid concentrations achieved by exogenous administration were comparable with levels observed following ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF. No difference in the luteal phase length was observed comparing all groups. However, a significant decrease in LH levels could be observed 6 days after the mid-cycle LH surge (P<0.001) in women receiving P, resulting in accelerated decrease of inhibin A production by the corpus luteum (P=0.001).\nContext 3: To evaluate the effect of high-dose oral contraceptives on serum and uterine luminal fluid progesterone-associated endometrial protein in the luteal phase.\nContext 4: Four women presented with strongly retarded, proliferative endometrium in the luteal phase. Of these, three presented with impaired ovarian function, high basal follicle-stimulating hormone, and high follicle-stimulating hormone levels after clomiphene stimulation on cycle day 10. In the remaining 30 women, showing an in-phase endometrium after CC stimulation, a comparison of six morphological characteristics did not reveal any significant differences between the 14 women who did become pregnant and the 16 who did not. No significant differences in endometrial thickness were observed between the groups. Significant differences were found when comparing estradiol and progesterone area under the curve during the luteal phase (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) between those who did and those who did not become pregnant.\nContext 5: Forty non-smoking, normal weight women, between 18 and 37 years of age, with a regular menstrual cycle (24-35 days), received either high dosages of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), E2+P or no medication. Blood sampling was performed every other day from the day of the mid-cycle LH surge until the end of the luteal phase. The luteal phase was defined as the period between the day of the mid-cycle LH surge and the day of the next LH surge. The luteal phase was divided into three phases: the first phase (days 1-7), the second phase (days 8-14) and the third phase (days 15-21). The luteal phase was defined as the period between the day of the mid-cycle LH surge and the day of the next LH surge. The luteal phase was divided into three phases: the first phase (days 1-7), the second phase (days 8-14) and the third phase (days", "Contexts:\nContext 1: This was a non-interventional, multicentre, prospective, surveillance study in which a collagen fleece-bound fibrin sealant was prescribed in accordance with its marketing authorisation. The decision to use the sealant was based solely on current surgical practice. All patients that received the sealant and provided informed consent were included. TEEs (any coagula-based occlusion in a vessel or the heart identified by symptomatic clinical signs and/or verified by paraclinical examination), major bleeding (any bleeding that required intervention), and immunological events (hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis) that occurred during surgery, post-operative hospital stay or 6 months of follow-up were reported as adverse events. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing a confirmed TEE.\nContext 2: Topical haemostatic agents are used to help achieve haemostasis during surgery when standard surgical techniques are insufficient. The objective of this study was to confirm the safety profile of an equine collagen patch coated with human fibrinogen and human thrombin with particular focus on the occurrence of thromboembolic events (TEEs), major bleeding and immunological events.\nContext 3: All tested laboratory parameters were comparable between the intraosseous and intravenous groups at baseline, hemodilution, and 30 minutes after fibrinogen concentrate administration. In vivo recovery of fibrinogen was also similar in the two groups (89% [23%] and 91% [22%], respectively). There were no significant between-group differences in any of the thromboelastometric parameters. Histologic examination indicated no adverse effects on the tissue surrounding the intraosseous administration site.\nContext 4: Fibrin glue products and collagen surgical patches (TachoSil) coated with coagulation factors I and IIa are increasingly being used to prevent oozing from distal or proximal coronary anastomosis. Furthermore, an increasing number of patients are being operated upon anti-platelet therapy. These patients often exhibit diffuse bleeding. Especially in an off-pump scenario surgeons refrain from placing additional stitches in order to avoid an impairment of the graft. In these situations, a biological glue can help resolve this dilemma. It is, however, assumed that these products may exert negative effects on the anastomosis. For obvious reasons a systematic histological assessment in humans is impossible. Therefore, a chronic, large animal model was developed to study the fate of these products on a coronary anastomosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of fibrin glue and collagen surgical patches coated with coagulation factors I and IIa on the anastomosis in a large animal model.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a collagen patch coated with coagulation factors I and IIa in a large animal model. The patch was applied to the coronary anastomosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in a pig model. The patch was removed after 24 hours and the anastomosis was evaluated by histology and hemodynamics.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a collagen patch coated with", "Question: Are accessory renal arteries related to hypertension risk : a review of MR angiography data??\nContext 1: It has been hypothesized that accessory renal arteries are related to the risk of hypertension. Our goal was to determine the prevalence of accessory renal arteries in hypertensive patients using MR angiography and to assess the relationship between accessory renal arteries and hypertension risk.\nContext 2: Of 185 hypertensive patients, 45 (24%) showed accessory renal arteries. Of these 45 patients, nine (20%) showed renal artery stenosis and 36 (80%) showed no significant stenosis. Of the 140 patients with a single renal artery, 42 (30%) showed renal artery stenosis and 98 (", "Question: Does mutational analysis of the vitamin D receptor support its candidacy as a tumor suppressor gene in parathyroid adenomas??\nThe vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a compelling candidate tumor suppressor gene for parathyroid adenomas based on existing evidence of the vitamin D system's antiproliferative actions in parathyroid and other tissues, its reported inhibition of PTH gene transcription, and the decreased expression of VDR mRNA and VDR protein observed in parathyroid adenomas.

The authors report that 88 patients graded dysphagia and heartburn on a Likert scale (0 = none; 5 = severe). Patients graded outcomes as excellent, good, fair, or poor. Outcomes were compared in the same patients at 1 and 3 years of follow-up. The authors report that 30%", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In recent years, there is considerable evidence of a relationship between the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) and pain disorders, including migraine and fibromyalgia. An association between multi-site pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of young adults.\nContext 2: Twenty two year olds (n = 1072), followed since birth of part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex, psychological distress and sleep quality.\nContext 3: To determine whether clinical response to the dopamine agonist, ropinirole, in the treatment of primary restless legs syndrome (RLS), depends upon the age-at-onset of RLS symptoms.\nContext 4: Statistically significant associations were found between UI and the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.20-1.76), fatigue and sleeping disorders (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30-1.95), feelings of humiliation (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.50), financial problems (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11-1.66), and reluctance to seek medical care (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.21-1.68).\nContext 5: Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), also called restless legs syndrome (RLS), is a neurologic sensorimotor disease that may be associated with cardiovascular disease. Given high morbidity and mortality rates of cardiovascular disease worldwide, we assessed the relation between WED/RLS and cardiovascular health risks in a native South American population. We prospectively analyzed data from The Atahualpa Project of Ecuadorian adults aged 40\u00a0years and older. Physicians interviewed consented participants and collected data on cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking. We used logistic regression to assess the association between WED/RLS and cardiovascular risk factors. We also used Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the association between WED/RLS and cardiovascular mortality. We found that 10.5% of participants had WED/RLS. Participants with WED/RLS were more likely to have hypertension (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4), diabetes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0), dyslipidemia (OR 2.1, 95% CI", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To determine whether the use of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine before colectomy is associated with an increased rate of postoperative complications.\nContext 2: All patients who underwent colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis between 1997 and 1999 were identified. Medical records were abstracted for demographics, extent and duration of disease, dose and duration of corticosteroids and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, albumin, and Truelove/Witts score. Early (30-day) and late (6-month) complications were identified. Noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive use was coded as none, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine within 1 week of surgery, or therapy with other immunosuppressive agents within 1 month of surgery. A logistic regression analysis assessed the association between these variables and complications.\nContext 3: Twenty-one patients with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (14, Crohn disease; 7, chronic ulcerative colitis); 17 taking variable doses of corticosteroids and 14 on sulfasalazine or metronidazole. Of the 21 patients, 10 had previously failed azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine trials.\nContext 4: Azathioprine and mercaptopurine (MP) are well established treatments for inflammatory bowel disease but they have severe adverse effects that prevent their use in some patients. The likelihood and type of adverse effect may relate to thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity and genotype.\nContext 5: This retrospective study was based on a total of 186 inflammatory bowel disease patients (104 with Crohn's disease; 82 with ulcerative colitis), who were stable on azathioprine for a minimum of 6 months. The median duration of follow-up was 4.3 years (range 0.6-15.5 years). Relapse rates per year of follow-up were compared in an azathioprine + 5-aminosalicylate group (n = 103) and an azathioprine alone group (n = 83); survival curves for cumulative remission rates were compared by log-rank test. Discontinuation of azathioprine in both groups was also recorded, as was the incidence of malignancy.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no. If yes, explain why.

However, the presence of an ossific nucleus is not a risk factor for osteonecrosis in children with DDH who undergo PAO.", "Question: Does cardiac rehabilitation for women : one size fit all??\nContext 1: Cardiac rehabilitation programs have been based on research with almost exclusively male participants. It was unclear if cardiac rehabilitation programs meet the needs of women.\nContext 2: To investigate women's perceptions of the contribution of cardiac rehabilitation to their recovery from a myocardial infarction.\nContext 3: 436 participants (77% males; mean age 64\u2009\u00b1\u200913 years) were submitted to a two-week cardiac rehabilitation program consisting of low to medium intensity, individualized training with respiratory, aerobic and calisthenic exercises (three sessions daily, six times per week). A six-minute walking test was performed at enrolment and repeated at discharge together with", "No, non-invasive continuous arterial pressure monitoring with Nexfin does not sufficiently replace invasive measurements in critically ill patients.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In the present study we found that asc1-deletion mutant (asc1Delta) presents some of the hallmarks of PKC signaling mutants. These include an increased sensitivity to staurosporine, a specific Pkc1p inhibitor, and susceptibility to cell-wall perturbing treatments such as hypotonic- and heat shock conditions and zymolase treatment. Microscopic analysis of asc1Delta cells revealed cell-wall invaginations near bud sites after exposure to hypotonic conditions, and the dynamic of cells' survival after this stress further supports the involvement of Asc1p in maintaining the cell-wall integrity during the mid-to late stages of bud formation. Genetic interactions between asc1 and pkc1 reveal synergistic sensitivities of a double-knock out mutant (asc1Delta/pkc1Delta) to cell-wall stress conditions, and high basal level of PKC signaling in asc1Delta. Furthermore, Asc1p has no effect on the cellular distribution or redistribution of Pkc1p at optimal or at cell-wall stress conditions.\nContext 2: The yeast ribosomal protein Asc1 is a WD-protein family member. Its mammalian ortholog, RACK1 was initially discovered as a receptor for activated protein C kinase (PKC) that functions to maintain the active conformation of PKC and to support its movement to target sites. In the budding yeast though, a connection between Asc1p and the PKC signaling pathway has never been reported.\nContext 3: Asc-1 reaches the plasma membrane in HeLa cells, unlike in oocytes, most probably by interaction with endogenous 4F2hc and presents similar transport characteristics to those in oocytes coexpressing asc-1/4F2hc. Asc-1 mediates a substantial efflux of alanine in a facilitated diffusion mode of transport. Expression of asc-1 mRNA localized to Henle's loop, distal tubules, and collecting ducts. Finally, SLC7A10 polymorphisms were identified in cystinuria probands and the SLC7A10 sequence variant E112D showed full transport activity.\nContext 4: We used an EST-based homology cloning strategy. Transport characteristics of asc-1 were assessed by coexpression with 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes and HeLa cells. Localization of asc-1 mRNA in kidney was assessed by in situ hybridization. Exons and intron-exon boundaries were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified and sequenced. The asc-1 protein was purified from HeLa cells and expressed in E. coli. The asc-1 protein was purified from HeLa cells and expressed in E. coli. The asc-1 protein was purified from HeLa cells and expressed in E. coli. The asc-1 protein was purified from HeLa cells and expressed in E. coli. The asc-1 protein was purified from HeLa cells and expressed in E. coli.

The solvents were evaporated, and the dried masses were suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide and used for anticariogenic activity by agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated by two-fold serial broth dilution method. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of effective extract was carried out by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and bioautography.\nThe results showed that the ethyl acetate extract of Bauhinia purpurea leaves has the highest activity against", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been reported to affect synaptic transmission and cause neuropathic pain. In contrast, lidocaine has been used to reduce neuropathic pain; however, the effect of NGF and lidocaine on spontaneous transmitter release and synapse excitation has not been fully defined. Therefore, the effect of NGF and lidocaine on nerve regeneration, synapse reformation, and subsequent spontaneous transmitter release was investigated. We used Lymnaea stagnalis soma-soma-identified synaptic reconstruction to demonstrate that a transient increase in both frequency and amplitude of spontaneous events of miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) occurs following NGF treatment and a short burst of action potentials in the presynaptic cell; in addition, the effect of lidocaine on NGF-induced synapse reformation was investigated.\nContext 2: NGF increased axonal growth, frequency, and amplitudes of MEPPs. Lidocaine exposure during synapse reformation periods was drastically and permanently reduced axonal growth and the incidence of synapse excitation by NGF.\nContext 3: Using a cell culture and electrophysiological and FM-143 imaging techniques for exocytosis on unequivocally identified presynaptic visceral dorsal 4 (VD4) and postsynaptic somata left pedal (LPeE) neurons from the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis, the effects of NGF and lidocaine on nerve regeneration, synapse reformation, and its electrophysiological spontaneous synaptic transmission between cultured neurons were described.\nContext 4: Our experiments on Drosophila third instar larvae revealed decreased locomotor activity, a decrease in NMJ length, a reduction in synaptic bouton number, and altered synaptic vesicle localization in jar mutants. Furthermore, our studies of synaptic transmission revealed alterations in both basal synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity at the jar mutant neuromuscular synapse.\nContext 5: Toosendanin is a pre-synaptic blocker at the neuromuscular junction and its inhibitory effect is divided into an initial facilitative/stimulatory phase followed by a prolonged inhibitory phase. The present study investigated whether the subsequent inhibitory phase was due to exhaustion of the secretory machinery as a result of extensive stimulation during the initial facilitative phase. More specifically, this paper examined whether toosendanin could directly inhibit the secretory machinery in exocrine cells.\n\nBased on the contexts above, the following conclusions were drawn:\n1. NGF increased axonal growth, frequency, and amplitudes of MEPPs.\n2. Lidocaine exposure during synapse reformation periods was drastically and permanently reduced axonal growth and the incidence of synapse excitation by NGF.\n3. Using a cell culture and electrophysiological and FM-143 imaging techniques for exocytosis on unequivocally identified presynaptic visceral dorsal 4 (VD4) and postsynaptic somata left pedal (LPeE) neurons from the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis, the effects of NGF and lidocaine on nerve regeneration, synapse reformation, and its electrophysiological spontaneous synaptic transmission between", "#1: Yes, post-conditioning protects from cardioplegia and cold ischemia via inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.\n#2: No, post-conditioning does not protect from cardioplegia and cold ischemia via inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.\n#3: Maybe, post-conditioning does not protect from cardioplegia and cold ischemia via inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.\n#4: No, post-conditioning does not protect from cardioplegia and cold ischemia via inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.\n#5: No, post-conditioning does not protect from cardioplegia and cold ischemia via inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore.\n#6: No, post-conditioning does not protect", "Yes, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is responsible for decreased paraoxonase-1 activity in chronic renal failure.\nExplanation: Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with decreased paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity. PON1 is an antioxidant enzyme that protects LDL from oxidation. PON1 activity is inversely related to LDL oxidation. PON1 activity is also inversely related to HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL size. HDL-C is a major determinant of PON1 activity. HDL-C is also inversely related to LDL oxidation. HDL-C is inversely related to CRF. HDL-C is also", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), highly expressed by keratinocytes in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients and bronchial epithelial cells in asthma, plays a key role in allergic diseases. Information on triggers for the release of TSLP in keratinocytes is still limited. Keratinocytes express Toll-like receptor (TLR) 5, the ligand for which is flagellin, the major structural protein of the flagella of Gram-negative bacteria. IL-4, IL-13 and TNF-\u03b1 (Th2/TNF) are associated with allergic diseases. TGF-\u03b1, one of the ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor, is overexpressed in keratinocytes in atopic dermatitis. We investigated the induction of TSLP expression in keratinocytes stimulated with flagellin and its modulation by the Th2/TNF cytokines and TGF-\u03b1.\nContext 2: Primary human keratinocytes were stimulated with flagellin with or without cytokines. The TSLP released was measured by ELISA. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.\nContext 3: Stimulation of keratinocytes with flagellin induced the release of TSLP protein and upregulation of the gene expression of TSLP and other pro-inflammatory molecules. The flagellin-induced release of TSLP was enhanced by the Th2/TNF cytokines or TGF-\u03b1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TLR5 expression suppressed the flagellin-induced TSLP gene expression.\nContext 4: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine, implicated in the development and progression of allergic diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated significantly increased expression and synthesis of TSLPin nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), compared with nonallergic control subjects. Also, there is significant correlation between the level of TSLP mRNA and symptom severity in AR patients. In this study, we investigated whether polymorphisms in the TSLP gene were associated with increased risk of AR in the Chinese population.\nContext 5: Our observation in this study reveals that flagellin-induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generation is critical for TLR5-dependent innate immune responses, including IL-8 production and MUC5AC expression in the nasal epithelium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the TLR5 antagonist, flagellin, inhibits the production of IL-8 and MUC5AC in the nasal epithelium of mice. These results suggest that flagellin may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AR.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of flagellin on the expression of MUC5AC and IL-8 in the nasal epithelium of mice. The results showed that flagellin induced the expression of MUC5AC and IL-8 in the nasal epithelium of mice. The expression of MUC5AC and IL-8 was significantly inhibited by the TLR5 antagonist, flagellin, in the nasal epith", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Forty-five men (mean age 57 years, range 37 to 67) with clinical localized prostate cancer underwent anatomic radical retropubic prostatectomy with standard tennis racket bladder neck reconstruction. The bladder neck was then intussuscepted using two 2-0 Maxon Lembert sutures placed lateral and posterior to the reconstructed bladder neck. Filling of the bladder with saline at this point revealed little leakage. Patient-reported continence at 3 months was compared with the published outcome of 64 men using the same quality-of-life instrument (the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index). At 3 months, 82% of men who underwent intussusception of the bladder neck were continent (no pad/dry pad) compared with 54% in our prior report (P = 0.0035). The occurrence of bladder neck contracture was similar: 7% versus 5%.\nContext 2: The present study included 72 patients who underwent non-nerve-sparing RRP without neoadjuvant therapy between January and December 2003. Among these 72 patients, intussusception of the bladder neck was performed in 24 who consented to this procedure. In the present series, continence was defined as the absence of any need to use sanitary pads or diapers. Continence was evaluated by a patient interview 1, 3 and 6 months after RRP.\nContext 3: There were no significant differences in clinicopathological characteristics between patients with and without intussusception of the bladder neck. The percentage of continent patients 1, 3 and 6 months after RRP was 34.7%, 63.9% and 95.8%, respectively, and there were no significant differences in continence between the two groups at any time point. Among several factors examined, only bladder neck preservation was an independent predictor of recovery from urinary incontinence 1 and 3 months after RRP.\nContext 4: Although there is no evidence that the reconstructed bladder neck actively contributes to post-radical prostatectomy continence, we set out to determine whether buttressing sutures, which prevent the bladder neck from pulling open as the bladder fills, would result in the earlier return of urinary control.\nContext 5: The objectives of the present study were to investigate whether buttressing sutures, which prevent the bladder neck from pulling open as the bladder fills, can promote earlier recovery from urinary incontinence after radical retropubic prostatectomy.\nContext 6: The present study included 72 patients who underwent non-nerve-sparing RRP without neoadjuvant therapy between January and December 2003.

The volunteers received either a 4-hour (11:00 pm to 3:00 am) infusion of hydrocortisone or a saline infusion. The hydrocortisone infusion rate was 0.3 mg/kg\u00b7h for the initial 3 minutes, 0.24 mg/kg\u00b7h for 9 minutes, and then 0.135 mg/kg\u00b7h until the end of the infusion. Plasma acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin concentrations (in-house two site sandwich assay) and ACTH, cortisol, insulin, GH, and glucose levels were measured every 10 minutes for 16 hours (5:00 pm to 9:00 am).\nContext 3: Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide released from the stomach. Ghrelin is found in the circulation in two forms: acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin. Acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin concentrations increase at night, when cortisol concentrations are low. Acute ghrelin administration increases ACTH and cortisol concentrations and a feedback loop between the ghrelin and ACTH-cortisol axis has been postulated. A previous study showed that exogenously induced hypercortisolism for 5 days decreased plasma ghrelin concentrations.\nContext 4: Eight healthy young men (aged 18-28 years, body mass index range, 20.6-26.2 kg/m(2)) had blood drawn every 10 minutes for acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin and every hour for free fatty acids (FFAs) during the last 24 hours of a 61.5-hour fast and during a fed day. FFAs were measured by a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy method. Acyl- and desacyl-ghrelin were measured in plasma by a two-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

However, during CSE, even small doses of intrathecally administered local anesthetics with opioids induce almost instant analgesia that precludes the testing of epidural catheters as well as early appreciation of failed epidural catheters. To overcome the shortcomings of CSE analgesia, dural puncture epidural (DPE) analgesia had been devised.\nContext 2: After exclusion of nineteen patients, final comparative data was available for 112 patients only [Group A (n = 63) versus Group B (n = 49)]. Per our analysis, the only positive aspect for DPE analgesia as compared to CLE analgesia was that patients who received DPE analgesia reported lower incidence for immediate failures of labor analgesia (P = 0.04). However, there was higher incidence of paresthesias while performing successful dural punctures (P < 0.0001). Pre-insertion epidural depth assessment with ultrasound (n = 112) correlated positively with the air-filled loss of resistance syringe technique (r = 0.88; P < 0.0001).\nContext 3: We investigated whether patient-controlled epidural analgesia in labor with bupivacaine and fentanyl provides more satisfaction to mothers than intermittent bolus epidural analgesia or patient-controlled epidural analgesia with plain bupivacaine.\nContext 4: This was a prospective observational trial of attempted EST during neuraxial analgesia in labouring women. Ten women received a double-segment CSE technique and one woman underwent continuous spinal analgesia following inadvertent dural puncture and deliberate placement of the catheter tip in the intrathecal space. In all CSE cases, the spinal injection was performed below the level of the epidural insertion. The motor threshold current (MTC) was determined by EST through the existing epidural/intrathecal catheter immediately following and at five, ten, and 15 mins after intrathecal injection of bupivacaine 1.75\u00a0mg and fentanyl 15\u00a0\u03bcg. Changes in the MTC were expressed as a percent change compared with baseline.\nContext 5: Although patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) during labor is a safe and effective method of analgesia, it is associated with a high incidence of maternal side effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of maternal side effects in women undergoing PCEA during labor.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of maternal side effects in women undergoing PCEA during labor.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of maternal side effects in women undergoing PCEA during labor.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of maternal side effects in women undergoing PCEA during labor.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of maternal side effects in women undergoing PCE", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Potentiating neurosteroids are some of the most efficacious modulators of the mammalian GABA(A) receptor. One of the crucial interactions may be between the C20 ketone group (D-ring substituent at C17) of the neurosteroid, and the N407 and Y410 residues in the M4 domain of the receptor. In this study, we examined the contribution of hydrogen bonding between 17beta-substituents on the steroid D-ring and the GABA(A) receptor to potentiation by neurosteroids.\nContext 2: A steroid with a 17beta-carbonitrile group (3alpha5alpha18nor17betaCN) was a potent and efficacious potentiator of the GABA(A) receptor. Potentiation was also shown by a cyclosteroid in which C21 and the C18 methyl group of (3alpha,5alpha)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one are connected within a six-membered ring containing a double bond as a hydrogen bond acceptor (3alpha5alphaCDNC12), a steroid containing a 17beta-ethyl group on the D-ring (3alpha5alpha17betaEt) and a steroid lacking a 17beta-substituent on the D-ring (3alpha5alpha17H). Single-channel kinetic analysis indicates that the kinetic mechanism of action is the same for the neurosteroid 3alpha5alphaP, 3alpha5alpha18nor17betaCN, 3alpha5alphaCDNC12, 3alpha5alpha17betaEt and 3alpha5alpha17H. Interestingly, 3alpha5alpha17betaEt, at up to 3 microM, was incapable of potentiating the alpha1N407A/Y410F double mutant receptor.\nContext 3: Neurosteroids have various physiological and neuropsychopharmacological effects. In addition to the genomic effects of steroids, some neurosteroids modulate several neurotransmitter receptors and channels, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors, and sigma(1) receptors, and voltage-gated Ca(2+) and K(+) channels. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of neurosteroids have not yet been sufficiently clarified. In the nervous system, inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channels also play important roles in the control of resting membrane potential, action potential firing, and synaptic transmission. In this study, we examined the effects of neurosteroids on Kir channels.\nContext 4: The GABA(A) receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by GABA and modulated by a variety of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The GABA(A) receptor is composed of a pentameric assembly of four subunits, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and a ligand-binding subunit, alpha2. The alpha2 subunit is a heterodimer of alpha1 and alpha2, and the alpha1 subunit is a heterodimer of alpha1 and alpha3. The alpha1 subunit is a ligand-gated ion channel", "definitely yes\nExplanation: Aliskiren is a novel renin inhibitor that is renoprotective in a model of advanced diabetic nephropathy in rats.

Additionally, no differences in the level of anxiety were found between parents of high- and low-risk infants failing neonatal auditory screening.\nContext 3: Two hundred and eighty-eight parents of infants included in the neonatal hearing screening protocol of our Institution were tested with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and with an open-question questionnaire investigating parents' attitude to", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection can reduce the rebleeding rate of peptic ulcer bleeding in the long term. There are few data on the influence of H. pylori on the rebleeding rate in the acute phase of bleeding however. We therefore prospectively investigated the influence of H. pylori infection on the early rebleeding rate in patients who had undergone successful endoscopic hemostasis treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding.\nContext 2: Between January 1996 and November 2000 all patients with peptic ulcer bleeding were evaluated consecutively. The diagnosis of H. pylori infection was made at index endoscopy, using histology and the rapid urease test. Bleeding activity was assessed using the Forrest classification. After successful endoscopic hemostasis all patients received omeprazole 40 mg or pantoprazole 40 mg, intravenously, twice a day for 3 days. Rebleeding episodes were recorded over 21 days following primary hemostasis.\nContext 3: Eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori is effective in preventing peptic ulcer recurrence, but its efficacy in ulcer healing is still controversial. The effect of H. pylori on artificial ulcers after endoscopic resection is not known. The purpose of the present study was therefore to evaluate the influence of H. pylori infection on ulcer healing after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).\nContext 4: We performed a prospective cohort study to investigate the effects of gastroprotective agents (such as proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists) on long-term clinical outcomes of patients with Helicobacter pylori-negative idiopathic bleeding ulcers.\nContext 5: Patients with H pylori-negative idiopathic bleeding ulcers were recruited from a single center from April 2002 to March 2009 (n = 663). Age- and sex-matched patients with H pylori-positive bleeding ulcers were used as controls (n = 633). After ulcers had healed, 566 patients in the H pylori-negative idiopathic ulcer cohort received gastroprotective agents at clinicians' discretion, whereas controls received no gastroprotective agent after H pylori eradication therapy. Patients were followed until September 2011 for end points that included recurrent ulcer bleeding and all-cause mortality.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\nThe following is a list of possible answers.

They occur more frequently in patients with ischemic stroke than in the general population, but their relation to cognition in these patients is uncertain, particularly in the long run. We examined the relationship between microbleeds in patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke, and cognitive performance 4 years later.\nContext 2: Participants were recruited from a prospective multicenter cohort of patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke (n=397). They underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including a T2*-weighted sequence, within 3 months after their ischemic event. Microbleeds, atrophy, lacunae and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were rated visually. Cognitive status was examined in 94% of all patients who were still alive after a mean interval of 3.8 years by the Dutch version of the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS; n=280) or by an Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) obtained from a close relative if a TICS could not be obtained (n=48). The relationship between presence of microbleeds and TICS or IQCODE score was assessed with linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, educational level and time interval between MRI and cognitive evaluation.\nContext 3: To investigate the relationship between brain microbleeds (MBs) and the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD).\nContext 4: The mean age was 65\u00b112 years at inclusion. The vascular event at inclusion was a TIA in 170 patients (52%) and a minor ischemic stroke in 155 patients (47%). Microbleeds were present in 11.6% of the patients. Patients with microbleeds were significantly older than patients without microbleeds (70\u00b19 vs. 64\u00b112 years), more often had hypertension, and had more cerebral atrophy, WMH and lacunae on MRI (all p<0.05). The mean TICS score was 35.3\u00b15.9 for patients with microbleeds (n=29) and 34.6\u00b15.2 for patients without microbleeds (n=251); the adjusted mean difference (95% CI) was 1.69 (-0.01 to 3.38). The total IQCODE score was 66.3\u00b19.4 for patients with microbleeds (n=29) and 65.9\u00b19.2 for patients without microbleeds (n=251); the adjusted mean difference (95% CI) was 0.44 (-0.02 to 0.90). The adjusted mean difference in the rate of cognitive decline was 0.02 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.05).\nContext 5: The presence of microbleeds was not associated with a higher rate of cognitive decline in patients with a TIA or minor ischemic stroke.\nContext 6: The presence of microbleeds was not associated with a higher rate of cognitive decline in patients with a TIA or minor", "No, preoperative mechanical bowel preparation does not offer a benefit for patients who undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy.\nThe study by Karaman et al.

However, there was no difference in the incidence of delayed gastric emptying or pancreatic fistula. The authors concluded that preoperative mechanical bowel preparation may be beneficial for patients who undergo pancreaticodu", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Sprague-Dawley rats were used for all experiments. Control rats (n=30) were divided into three equal groups and underwent splenectomy followed by sham vaccination 1, 7, or 42 days after splenectomy. Treated rats (n=66) were divided into three equal groups and underwent splenectomy followed by vaccination with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine 1, 7, or 42 days after splenectomy. All rats then underwent intraperitoneal Streptococcus pneumoniae inoculation with the predetermined lethal dose for 50% of the population 10 days after vaccination. Rats were observed for a 72-hour period after inoculation, and mortality was recorded. Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody titers were determined before vaccination and before inoculation to determine antibody response.\nContext 2: Pneumococcal vaccination after splenectomy for trauma decreases the incidence of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. The optimal timing of vaccination has not been established. This study was conducted to determine whether timing of vaccination after splenectomy affects antibody response or survival after pneumococcal challenge.\nContext 3: Mortality was greater in the control group than in the treatment group (21 of 30 [70%] vs. 2 of 64 [3%]; p < 0.01). There were no differences in mortality within either the control group (1 day, 6 of 10; 7 days, 7 of 10; 42 days, 8 of 10; p=0.62) or the treatment group (1 day, 0 of 21; 7 days, 0 of 21; 42 days, 2 of 22; p=0.14). Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody responses were greater in vaccinated than in nonvaccinated rats. There was no effect of timing of vaccination on antibody response.\nContext 4: In vitro, release of proinflammatory pneumococcal products was studied by enzyme immunoassay and western blot.

The number of potential recipients who die awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) has increased. Despite organ shortages, HRD grafts are often declined given infectious concerns. We hypothesized that recipients would have equivalent outcomes.\nContext 2: Recipients (n = 4954) were older and had more baseline comorbidity in recent years. A total of 445 recipients (9.0%) died or experienced a major cardiovascular event within 3 years of transplantation. There was no significant change in the incidence of the composite outcome or death-censored cardiovascular events over time (P = 0.41 and 0.92, respectively). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the risk of death or major cardiovascular event steadily declined across the years of transplant (2006-2009 adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; P = 0.009; referent 1994-1997). When recipients were matched on age, sex, and date of cohort entry to members of the general population and to the chronic kidney disease population, the risk was lowest in the general population and highest in the chronic kidney disease population.\nContext 3: To determine the effect of heart donors with echocardiographic abnormalities on short and long-term outcomes on heart transplant recipients.\nContext 4: In 2004, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) added the label \"high-risk donor\" (HRD) for any organ donor who met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for high-risk behavior for infection.

We hypothesized that the degree of pathological findings on pre-LTx high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in CF.\nContext 2: Lung transplantation is a viable option for patients with cystic fibrosis. The current strategy of selection, based on spirometry and deterioration of quality of life, results in a high mortality on the waiting list. We reviewed the case histories of patients with cystic fibrosis accepted for lung transplantation to ascertain whether pulmonary hemodynamics could contribute to predict life expectancy.\nContext 3: Forty-five patients with cystic fibrosis were accepted: 11 died on the waiting list (group I), 24 underwent transplantation (group II), and 10 are still waiting (group III). During evaluation we recorded spirometry, oxygen requirement, ratio of arterial oxygen tension to inspired oxygen fraction (PaO (2)/FIO (2)), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO (2)), 6-minute walk test results, right ventricular ejection fraction, echocardiography, and pulmonary hemodynamics. We compared data from group I, II, and III patients. A comparison was also made within group II between the data collected at the time of evaluation and at the time of transplantation to quantify the deterioration during the waiting time.\nContext 4: Among 356 lung transplants performed at our institution, 132 were from traumatic donors (70% male, 30% female).

Correlations and linear mixed models were performed to determine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between baseline amyloid \u03b21-42 (A\u03b242), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and measures of memory and executive function. Analyses also considered APOE genotype and tremor- vs. rigidity-dominant phenotype.\nContext 2: No association was found between baseline CSF biomarkers and cognitive test performance during Phase One. However, once levodopa treatment was initiated, higher p-tau and p-tau/A\u03b242 predicted subsequent decline on cognitive tasks involving both memory and executive functions. The interactions between biomarkers and cognition decline did not appear to be influenced by levodopa dosage, APOE genotype or motor phenotype.\nContext 3: The microtubule-associated protein tau is thought to play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration. Mutations in the tau coding gene MAPT are a cause of frontotemporal dementia, and the H1/H1 genotype of MAPT, giving rise to higher tau expression levels, is associated with progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Parkinson disease (PD). Furthermore, tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), and reducing endogenous tau has been reported to ameliorate cognitive impairment in a mouse model for AD. Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation have also been described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), both in human patients and in the mutant SOD1 mouse model for this disease. However, the precise role of tau in motor neuron degeneration remains uncertain.\nContext 4: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau is an excellent surrogate marker for assessing neuropathological changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, whether the elevated tau in AD CSF is just a marker of neurodegeneration or, in fact, a part of the disease process is uncertain. Moreover, the relationship between tau and cognitive decline in AD is not well understood. The current study sought to determine whether CSF tau is associated with cognitive decline in AD patients and whether tau is a marker of neurodegeneration in AD.\nContext 5: The current study sought to determine whether CSF tau is associated with cognitive decline in AD patients and whether tau is a marker of neurodegeneration in AD.\nContext 6: The current study sought to determine whether CSF tau is associated with cognitive decline in AD patients and whether tau is a marker of neurodegeneration in AD.\nContext 7: The current study sought to determine whether CSF tau is associated with cognitive decline in AD patients and whether tau is a marker of neurodegeneration in AD.", "Question: Is the glucocorticoid receptor overexpressed in malignant adrenocortical tumors??\nExplanation: The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. It is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the synthesis, metabolism, and secretion of glucocorticoids. The GR is a 53-kDa protein that is composed of two subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2, which are encoded by separate genes. The \u03b1 subunit is the hormone-binding domain, and the \u03b2 subunit is the ligand-binding domain. The GR is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. It is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) are important mediators of puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) induced minimal change nephrotic syndrome (NS) in rats. We have recently shown that cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a significant source of catalytic iron in this model of glomerular injury. The current study was designed to identify the CYP isozyme(s) in the rat glomeruli and explore the role of the specific isozyme(s) in PAN-induced minimal change NS.\nContext 2: The role of oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome is poorly understood.\nContext 3: CsA accumulation and CsA-induced reduction in glomerular filtration rate were similar in wild-type and Mrp2\u207b/\u207b kidneys. Renal vascular resistance and agonist-induced renal vascular responses were similar in both groups. A PCR array on 84 genes involved in the biotransformation and antioxidant defense revealed increased CsA-induced mRNA expression of genes involved in oxidative and metabolic stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This gene expression pattern was similar in wild-type and Mrp2\u207b/\u207b kidneys. CsA increased the renal cortical oxidized glutathione, did not affect xanthine oxidase-dependent superoxide formation, and decreased renal cortical NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide formation. Furthermore, CsA increased Mdr1 protein abundance to a greater extent in Mrp2\u207b/\u207b than in wild-type kidneys.\nContext 4: Multidrug resistance-related protein 2 (Mrp2) is expressed in apical membranes of renal proximal tubular cells and contributes to the renal secretion of cyclosporine A (CsA). Mrp2\u207b/\u207b deficiency may lead to local renal CsA accumulation. We investigated whether kidney-specific Mrp2 deficiency enhances acute CsA nephrotoxicity in rats.\nContext 5: Human paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is responsible for the antioxidant effect of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by inhibiting low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Previous studies discovered dyslipidemia (DL) and decreased PON1 activity in chronic renal failure (CRF). We aimed to determine PON and arylesterase activity, phenotypic distribution of the PON1 enzyme, and lipid profile in low and normal HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) patients with CRF, and renal transplant recipients (RTR).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the PPAR\u03b3 agonist GW9662 on the expression of the PPAR\u03b3 target genes in the kidney of rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the PPAR\u03b3 agonist GW9662 on the expression of the PPAR\u03b3 target genes in the kidney of rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the PPAR\u03b3 agonist GW9662 on the expression of the PPAR\u03b3 target genes in the kidney of rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UU", "Question: Does qualitative analysis of high-resolution CT scan in severe asthma??\nContext 1: High-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning is part of the management of severe asthma, but its application varies between centers. We sought to describe the HRCT scan abnormalities of a large severe asthma cohort and to determine the utility of clinical features to direct the use of HRCT scanning in this group of patients.\nContext 2: Subjects attending our Difficult Asthma Clinic (DAC) between February 2000 and November 2006 (n = 463) were extensively re-characterized and 185 underwent HRCT scan. The HRCT scans were analyzed qualitatively and the interobserver variability was assessed. Using logistic regression we defined clinical parameters that", "Question: Is gLUT4 and UBC9 protein expression reduced in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients with severe insulin resistance??\nYes, gLUT4 and UBC9 protein expression is reduced in muscle from type 2 diabetic patients with severe insulin resistance.\nExplanation: GLUT4 is the principal glucose transporter in skeletal muscle and is regulated by insulin. Insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, which is mediated by the association of AS160 and TBC1D1. AS160 and TBC1D1 are Rab GTPase-activating proteins that regulate GLUT4 translocation. In skeletal muscle, AS160 and TBC1D1 are phosphorylated by insulin and this phosphorylation is required for", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The study cohort consisted of 51 patients aged below 50 years presenting with acute coronary syndromes. In both patient group and normal individuals the major risk factors Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, anticardiolipin antibodies, Fibrinogen and Lipoprotein [a] were studied. Factor V Leiden (FVL) G1691A mutation in both control and patient group was looked by using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing of the PCR products.\nContext 2: The prevalence of Coronary artery disease (CAD) in India has increased considerably over the past few years and could become the number one killer disease if interventions are not done. Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and FII G20210A polymorphism are two recently described genetic factors with a propensity towards venous thrombosis. This warrants the investigations for thrombophilia in myocardial infarction patients in India.\nContext 3: Factor V Leiden (FvL) causing activated protein C resistance is a genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis in humans, and it's effect on atherosclerosis is controversial. We evaluated the effect of FvL mutation on atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient mice fed with normal diet.\nContext 4: A 5-year retrospective review of standardized pediatric stroke clinic evaluations of children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) or sinovenous thrombosis (SVT). A family history of early pathological thrombosis was defined as stroke, heart attack, or deep venous thrombosis before 50 years of age or multiple miscarriages in the parents or grandparents of the patient. We evaluated the association between family history and the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation (FVL) and/or Prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTG) in these children.\nContext 5: Resistance to activated protein C (APC resistance), caused by a single point mutation in the factor V gene (FV:R506Q), is a major risk factor for venous thrombosis. As the significance of this mutation among unselected outpatients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is not established, we have studied its prevalence among consecutive outpatients attending the emergency room due to a clinically suspected DVT.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\n1. The study cohort consisted of 51 patients aged below 50 years presenting with acute coronary syndromes. In both patient group and normal individuals the major risk factors Protein C deficiency, Protein S deficiency, anticardiolipin antibodies, Fibrinogen and Lipoprotein [a] were studied. Factor V Leiden (FVL) G1691A mutation in both control and patient group was looked by using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing of the PCR products.\n2. The prevalence of Coronary artery disease (CAD) in India has increased considerably over the past few years and could become the number one killer disease if interventions are not done.

In addition, 22.5% of the sera were not reactive (Ab-NR). Ab-\u03b2 patients presented more cases of arrhythmias in exercise testing (P <.001). In Holter, ventricular arrhythmias appeared more than twice as often in the Ab-\u03b2 group than in the Ab-NR group and in numbers similar to the Ab-M\u03b2 group (Ab-NR: 2; Ab-\u03b2: 5; Ab-M\u03b2: 3). Arrhythmias were induced by Ab-M\u03b2 in isolated rabbit hearts. Sera from patients with Ab-M\u03b2, who had longer PR intervals, were able to reversibly prolong PR when perfused in isolated rabbit heart (r\u00b2 = 0.74; P =.02).\nContext 2: Although decreased vagal tone, as measured by heart rate variability is a risk factor for ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac death, it is unknown whether increasing vagal tone has an antiarrhythmic effect. The purpose of this study was to determine whether edrophonium hydrochloride (HCI), a vagomimetic agent, increases VF threshold.\nContext 3: Flecainide, a class 1c antiarrhythmic, has emerged as an effective therapy in preventing arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) refractory to \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade. It has been proposed that the clinical efficacy of flecainide in CPVT is because of the combined actions of direct blockade of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) and Na(+) channel inhibition. However, there is presently no direct evidence to support the notion that flecainide blocks RyR2 Ca(2+) flux in the physiologically relevant (luminal-to-cytoplasmic) direction. The mechanism of flecainide action remains controversial.\nContext 4: To investigate the actions of noradrenaline and the specific alpha-adrenergic agonists cirazoline (alpha1) and UK14304 (alpha2), and beta-receptor agonists formoterol and salbutamol on the contractile response of the isolated rabbit heart.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the antiarrhythmic effect of flecainide is mediated by the inhibition of Na(+) channel activity. The Na(+) channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), was used to determine whether the antiarrhythmic effect of flecainide is mediated by the inhibition of Na(+) channel activity.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the antiarrhythmic effect of flecainide is mediated by the inhibition of Na(+) channel activity. The Na(+) channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), was", "Question: Does pre-treatment with Aloe vera juice enhance the in vitro permeation of ketoprofen across skin??\nYes, pre-treatment with Aloe vera juice enhances the in vitro permeation of ketoprofen across skin.\nNo, pre-treatment with Aloe vera juice does not enhance the in vitro permeation of ketoprofen across skin.\nMaybe, pre-treatment with Aloe vera juice does not enhance the in vitro permeation of ketoprofen across skin.\nContext 1: The potential of pre-treating skin with Aloe vera juice as a penetration enhancer was evaluated in vitro using ketoprofen as model permeant.\nContext 2: No statistically significant differences in the transdermal delivery of ketopro", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To investigate the protective action of Epimedium against chemotherapy-induced damage to rat epididymides.\nContext 2: Fifty 60-day-old male rats were divided into a control, a model and a treatment group. Procarbazine was injected into the abdominal cavity of the model rats at the dose of 30 mg/(kg x d). In addition to procarbazine, Epimedium was given intragastrically to the treatment group. The changes in the ultrastructure of the epididymis were observed after 10 and 20 days.\nContext 3: Electron microscopy showed that the chemotherapy-induced damages to the epididymal epithelia mainly included cell swelling, local cavitation of mitochondria, tumor-like change in nucleoli, agglutination of marginal translocation of heterochromatin and cell apoptosis. The damage to the epithelial ultrastructure was slight in the treatment group as compared with the model rats. Chemotherapy significantly affected sperm concentration, sperm viability and sialic acid (SA), which were (15.59 +/- 4.01) x 10(6)/ml, (76.71 +/- 10.11)% and (19.38 +/- 9.34) g/mg prot in the model group in comparison with (10.63 +/- 3.82) x 10(6)/ml (P < 0.01), (60.03 +/- 7.54)% (P < 0.01) and (13.62 +/- 7.81) g/g prot (P < 0.05) in the control. Epimedium significantly increased sperm viability in the treatment group (60.03 +/- 7.54)% as compared with the model rats (69.90 +/- 12.58)% (P < 0.05).\nContext 4: Normal tissue radiosensitivity is the major limiting factor in radiotherapy of cancer. The use of phytochemicals may reduce the adverse effects of radiation in normal tissue. The effect of ethyl acetate fraction of Aphanamixis polystachya (EAP) was investigated on the radiation-induced chromosome damage in the bone marrow cells of Swiss albino mice exposed to various doses of gamma-radiation.\nContext 5: Exposure to chemotherapy causes various adverse effects on the ovaries including premature ovarian failure and infertility. GnRH antagonist cetrorelix could reverse the ovarian damage during chemotherapy, but the mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cetrorelix on the ovarian damage during chemotherapy.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cetrorelix on the ovarian damage during chemotherapy.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cetrorelix on the ovarian damage during chemotherapy.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cetrorelix on the ovarian damage during chemotherapy.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cetrorelix on the ovarian damage during chemotherapy.\nContext 10: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cetrorelix on the ovarian damage during", "Yes, serum sialic acid concentration is abnormal in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG), in Fijian Melanesians.\nExplanation: Serum sialic acid concentration was not significantly different in patients with normal or nearly normal coronary angiograms compared with those with triple-vessel disease (68+/-10 mg/100 mL and 68+/-11 mg/100 mL, respectively). Neither was there any association between the extent or severity of coronary disease and serum sialic acid levels.\nContext 3: Total serum sial", "Question: Does abdominal lymphatic pump treatment increase leukocyte count and flux in thoracic duct lymph??\nExplanation: The thoracic duct is a major lymphatic vessel that drains the thorax and mediastinum.

The incidence of IBD-related CRC differs markedly between cohorts from referral centers and population-based studies. In the present study we aimed to identify characteristics potentially explaining these differences in two cohorts of patients with IBD-related CRC.\nContext 1: In the two groups with back wounds, the incidence of cancer growth at the incision was zero, as demonstrated grossly and by histologic sample (A: 0/47, B: 0/43). In contrast, the autopsied control group had a 42% incidence of metastasis to the wound (25/59", "No, a lower proportion of circulating active PTH fragments (1-84 PTH) in patients on CAPD does not predict the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\nExplanation: The aim of this study is to evaluate possible differences in the proportion of these fragments according to dialysis type: haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD).\nContext 1: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) shows a strong correlation with histomorphometric and biochemical parameters of bone turnover, however its measurement presents limitations due to", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The BRAF(V600E) mutation, the most common genetic alteration reported in papillary thyroid carcinoma, has been associated with poor prognostic factors. BRAF(V600E) mutation is correlated with local aggressive clinicopathological features in papillary thyroid carcinoma; yet the relationship between this genetic variation and distant metastasis was unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether BRAF(V600E) is predictive for distant metastasis in the Chinese population.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Severe heart failure (HF) is associated with cachexia; this is often reversed post cardiac transplantation (HTx) with frequent development of obesity. Growth hormone (GH) resistance is common in HF and may contribute to cachexia. Whether GH resistance resolves post HTx is unknown. We aimed to confirm that HF is associated with GH resistance and to test the hypothesis that GH resistance resolves post HTx.\nContext 2: In adults with growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD), GH treatment restores impaired endothelial function, a precursor of cardiovascular disease. Its effect in children with GHD is unknown.\nContext 3: Cytokine genotyping was performed for the following cytokines on 94 transplanted children using polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific technique: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (-308), interleukin 10 (-1082, -819, -592), interleukin 6 (-174), transforming growth factor-beta1 (codons 10 & 25), and interferon-gamma (+874). Patients with ventricular failure after transplantation for dilated cardiomyopathy, numbering 37, or for congenital heart disease, numbering 34, were compared to 15 children transplanted for structural disease, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, without ventricular failure, and to data from healthy children. An additional 8 children with restrictive or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were also studied.\nContext 4: Although orthotopic heart transplantation has been an effective treatment for end-stage heart failure, the incidence of allograft failure has increased, necessitating treatment options. Cardiac retransplantation remains the only viable long-term solution for end-stage cardiac allograft failure. Given the limited number of available donor hearts, the long term results of this treatment option need to be evaluated.\nContext 5: Heart transplantation remains the gold standard treatment for selected patients with end-stage heart failure. However, transplantation in diabetic patients remains controversial. The hyperglycemic effect of immunosuppressant therapy further complicates posttransplantation management of diabetes and, although this is still unproven, could be responsible for a higher incidence of post-transplantation infection, rejection and mortality. In this study, we aimed to compare one-year outcomes of survival and morbidity after cardiac transplantation among recipients with and without diabetes mellitus.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n    - The study was conducted in 94 children who underwent heart transplantation.

We compared the risk:benefit ratios between prophylactic radiofrequency ablation and no treatment in asymptomatic patients with WPW.\nContext 2: Decision analysis software was used to construct a risk-benefit decision tree. The target population consisted of 20- to 40-year-old asymptomatic patients with WPW without structural fatal heart disease or a family history of sudden cardiac death. Baseline estimates of sudden death and radiofrequency ablation complication rates were obtained from the literature, an empirical data survey, and expert opinion. The outcome measure was death within 10 years. Sensitivity analyses determined the variables that significantly impacted the decision to ablate or not. Threshold analyses evaluated the effects of key variables and the optimum policy. At baseline, the decision to ablate resulted in a reduction of mortality risk of 8.8 patients for 1000 patients compared with abstention. It is necessary to treat 112 asymptomatic patients with WPW to save one life over 10 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that 3 variables significantly impacted the decision to ablate: (1) complication of radiofrequency ablation, (2) success of radiofrequency ablation, and (3) sudden death in asymptomatic patients with WPW.\nContext 3: Ablations were performed for 12 minutes using energy output of impedance-based (power output gradually rose to 200W, maintained until increases in tissue impedance of 20 \u03a9, reduced to 10W, and switched on again 15 seconds later) in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or 80 W in MWA. Before ablation, 5 mL of ethanol, distilled water, 0.9% NaCl solution, or 10% NaCl solution (n = 6 each) was injected into the targeted liver tissue. Ablations without fluid injection served as control. The ablation diameter, volume, shape index, and temperature were recorded and compared.\nContext 4: The mean follow-up duration after RF ablation was 43.7\u00b130.7 months (range=7-92 months). The mean nodule volume was 9.7 mL (0.9-57.6 mL) before the procedure, and was significantly decreased at the last follow-up (p<0.001) with a mean volume reduction rate of 87.2%. The mean symptom score (0-10) was 2.5\u00b11.2 at the last follow-up, and was significantly decreased at the last follow-up (p<0.001) with a mean symptom score reduction rate of 87.2%.

The 24-h lipid incubation increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in HSkMC from lean subjects by +16% (P<0.05); conversely, mtDNA copy number decreased in myotubes cultured from obese individuals (-13%, P=0.06). When respiration data were normalized to mtDNA copy number and other indices of mitochondrial content (COX-IV protein content and CS activity), the significant treatment effects of lipid incubation persisted in the lean subjects, suggesting concomitant alterations in mitochondrial function; no similar adjustment was evident in HSkMC from obese individuals.\nContext 3: The skeletal muscle of obese humans is characterized by an inability to appropriately respond to alterations in substrate availability. The purpose of this study was to determine if this metabolic inflexibility with obesity is retained in mitochondria of human skeletal muscle cells raised in culture (HSkMC) and to identify potential mechanisms involved.\nContext 4: Deleterious effects of saturated fatty acids in skeletal muscle cells are well known but their impact on mitochondrial respiration has not been well studied. Mitochondrial oxidative damage has been implicated to play a role in their effect. The purpose of this study was to evaluate viability, mtDNA integrity and mitochondrial respiration in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes exposed to palmitate and to test the effect of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants MitoQ and MitoTEMPOL in preventing palmitate-induced damage.\nContext 5: Stimulation with gAd decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) gene expression in the obese and diabetic samples (p < or = 0.05) and increased cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit 4 (COXIV) gene expression in the myotubes derived from lean individuals only (p < 0.05). AICAR treatment also decreased PDK4 gene expression in the obese- and diabetic-derived myotubes (p < or = 0.05) and increased COXIV gene expression in the myotubes derived from lean individuals (p < 0.05). The effect of AICAR on PDK4 gene expression was not observed in the myotubes derived from obese individuals. The effect of AICAR on COXIV gene expression was not observed in the myotubes derived from obese individuals.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 24-h lipid incubation on mitochondrial respiration in human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMC) derived from lean and obese individuals.

Whether liver transplant recipients are at higher risk for developing more common cancers is unclear. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving living donor liver transplantation appear to possess significantly higher tumor recurrence than the recipients receiving deceased donor liver transplantation. The underlying mechanism for HCC recurrence after transplantation remains unclear. Here, we aim to investigate the impact of small-for-size liver graft injury on HCC recurrence after transplantation. Liver transplantation with livers grafts from elderly donors has been associated with a higher risk of biliary complications. The aim of", "No, prolonged measurement does not improve the assessment of the barrier function of the gastro-esophageal junction.\nExplanation: The gastro-esophageal junction (EGJ) is a complex structure that is difficult to measure. The most commonly used manometric parameters for assessment of EGJ function are sub-optimal, potentially because they reflect only a very brief (up to 30\u00a0seconds), not necessarily representative period. This prospective, case-control study tested the performance of novel, high-resolution manometry (HRM) parameters of EGJ function in the assessment of GERD. The results showed that HRM parameters of EGJ function are more sensitive than conventional manometric parameters in the assessment of GERD", "Question: Does the amount of avian antigen in household dust predict the prognosis of chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis??\nYes, the amount of avian antigen in household dust predicts the prognosis of chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\nThe amount of avian antigen in household dust was significantly higher for the deterioration group than for the stable group. In logistic regression analysis, avian antigen was the only variable found to be significant for distinguishing between the two groups. The patients with higher amounts of household dust avian antigen had a poor prognosis in the survival analysis. Avian antigen was the only variable to significantly influence the prognosis of chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\nThe amount of avian antigen in household dust was significantly higher", "Question: Is in patients with acute myocardial infarction, the impact of hyperglycemia as a risk factor for mortality homogeneous across age-groups??\nExplanation: The impact of hyperglycemia as a risk factor for mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction is homogeneous across age-groups.

The risk of mortality is higher in patients with hyperglycemia than in patients with norm", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Cellular RNA polymerases are highly conserved enzymes that undergo complex conformational changes to coordinate the processing of nucleic acid substrates through the active site. Two domains in particular, the bridge helix and the trigger loop, play a key role in this mechanism by adopting different conformations at various stages of the nucleotide addition cycle. The functional relevance of these structural changes has been difficult to assess from the relatively small number of static crystal structures currently available.\nContext 2: Using a novel robotic approach we characterized the functional properties of 367 site-directed mutants of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii RNA polymerase A' subunit, revealing a wide spectrum of in vitro phenotypes. We show that a surprisingly large number of single amino acid substitutions in the bridge helix, including a kink-inducing proline substitution, increase the specific activity of RNA polymerase. Other'superactivating' substitutions are located in the adjacent base helices of the trigger loop.\nContext 3: Many components of the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery have been identified in kinetoplastid protozoa, but they diverge substantially from other eukaryotes. Furthermore, protein-coding genes in these organisms lack individual transcriptional regulation, since they are transcribed as long polycistronic units. The transcription initiation sites are assumed to lie within the 'divergent strand-switch' regions at the junction between opposing polycistronic gene clusters. However, the mechanism by which Kinetoplastidae initiate transcription is unclear, and promoter sequences are undefined.\nContext 4: The open complex formed at the initiation site of transcription within the active site of RNA polymerase is unique to actively transcribing genes and is thus an ideal target for the design of transcription inhibitors. Many redoxactive tetrahedral cuprous chelates of 1,10-phenanthroline (OP) or derivatives cleave the single-stranded template, principally at sequence positions -7 to -3, whereas the redox-inactive tetrahedral cuprous chelate of 2, 9-dimethyl-OP (neocuproine) blocks transcription, but does not cleave. The octahedral (OP)3-Fe2+ chelate has no effect. Different promoters can give different cleavage patterns. We therefore searched for structural determinants of the open complex that are important in the cleavage reaction.\nContext 5: We have examined the mechanism of S-AS RNA polymerase, a bacterial RNA polymerase that is able to transcribe the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) gene. The SAM gene is transcribed by a single RNA polymerase, and the SAM gene product is a SAM-dependent methyltransferase. The SAM gene is transcribed by a single RNA polymerase, and the SAM gene product is a SAM-dependent methyltransferase. The SAM gene is transcribed by a single RNA polymerase, and the SAM gene product is a SAM-dependent methyltransferase. The SAM gene is transcribed by a single RNA polymerase, and the SAM gene product is a SAM-dependent methyltransferase. The SAM gene is transcribed by a single RNA polymerase, and the SAM gene product", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In our initial attempt to identify differentiation markers for ocular surface epithelia, we observed a unique staining pattern by a commercial anti-Galphaq antibody. We further isolate and characterize the protein reactive with this anti-Galphaq antibody in human ocular surface epithelia.\nContext 2: The E-17 anti-Galphaq antibody preferentially stained the entire corneal epithelia and the suprabasal layers of the limbus with complete absence of staining in the basal limbus and conjunctiva. Western blot analysis of corneal epithelial cells showed that E-17 antibody identified a protein with a molecular weight of 55 kDa. However, the antibody did not react with the purported antigen, Galphaq protein (42 kDa) produced by Galphaq cDNA. Another anti-Galphaq antibody (G4415) did not react with the 55 kDa protein but did react with the 42 kDa Galphaq protein. Further comparison of the E-17 antibody with the J7 antibody revealed that both recognized the 55 kDa band in one and two dimensional analysis. MALDI-TOF MS analysis confirmed that the 55 kDa protein of interest was actually cytokeratin 12 (CK12), rather than Galphaq protein.\nContext 3: Human donor corneoscleral buttons were sectioned and stained with a battery of commercial antibodies against Galpha proteins. Western blot analysis of cell lysates of corneal epithelial cells and HEK 293 cells transfected with Galphaq cDNA was used to determine the identity of the protein reactive with the anti-Galphaq antibody (E-17). Comparisons were made with another anti-Galphaq antibody (G4415) and an anti-cytokeratin 12C (J7) antibody. The isolated proteins reactive with E17 and J7 were then analyzed with two dimensional isoelectric focusing. Polypeptide sequences were identified using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) after in-gel protein digestion.\nContext 4: An anti-IL-8 antibody (WS-4) was injected intravitreal 2 hours before, simultaneously with, or 6 hours after endotoxin challenge in rabbits. Eyes were examined for clinical signs of inflammation, and aqueous humor (AH) was sampled to study cellular infiltration and protein content. Leukocyte subset analysis was performed on Giemsa-stained smears of the AH. The AH was also analyzed for IL-8 protein content by ELISA. The results showed that the anti-IL-8 antibody (WS-4) was able to block the inflammatory response to endotoxin challenge in the rabbit eye. The anti-IL-8 antibody (WS-4) was also able to block the inflammatory response to endotoxin challenge in the rabbit eye. The anti-IL-8 antibody (WS-4) was able to block the inflammatory response to endotoxin challenge in the rabbit eye. The anti-IL-8 antibody (WS-4) was able to block the inflammatory response to endotoxin challenge in the rabbit eye. The anti-IL-8", "Question: Does platelet-rich plasma enhance return to play in hamstring injuries : a randomised controlled trial??\nExplanation: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in reducing the return to play duration in male athletes with hamstring injuries. The study was a randomised, three-arm, parallel-group trial, in which 90 professional athletes with MRI positive hamstring injuries were randomised to injection with PRP-intervention, platelet-poor plasma (PPP-control) or no injection. All received an intensive standardised rehabilitation programme. The primary outcome measure was time to return to play, with secondary measures including reinjury rate after 2 and 6\u2005months. The study was registered at ClinicalTri", "Question: Does human Amnion-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation ameliorate Liver Fibrosis in Rats??\nYes, human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) can be used to treat liver fibrosis. The results of this study show that hAMSCs can be used to treat liver fibrosis. The results of this study show that hAMSCs can be used to treat liver fibrosis. The results of this study show that hAMSCs can be used to treat liver fibrosis. The results of this study show that hAMSCs can be used to treat liver fibrosis. The results of this study show that hAMSCs", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We show that infection of human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y and liver C3A cells with recombinant adenovirus results in the activation of Akt in a dose dependent manner. In addition, this activation makes treated cells unresponsive to insulin stimulation as determined by an apparent lack of differential phosphorylation of Akt on serine-473. Our data further indicate that the use of recombinant baculovirus does not increase the phosphorylation of Akt in SHSY-5Y and C3A cells. Moreover, following infection with baculovirus, SHSY-5Y and C3A cells respond to insulin by means of phosphorylation of Akt on serine-473 in the same manner as uninfected cells.\nContext 2: Recombinant adenovirus vectors and transfection agents comprising cationic lipids are widely used as gene delivery vehicles for functional expression in cultured cells. Consequently, these tools are utilized to investigate the effects of functional over-expression of proteins on insulin mediated events. However, we have previously reported that cationic lipid reagents cause a state of insulin unresponsiveness in cell cultures. In addition, we have found that cultured cells often do not respond to insulin stimulation following adenovirus treatment. Infection with adenovirus compromises vital functions of the host cell leading to the activation of protein kinases central to insulin signalling, such as protein kinase B/Akt. Therefore, we investigated the effect of adenovirus infection on insulin unresponsiveness by means of Akt activation in cultured cells. Moreover, we investigated the use of baculovirus as a heterologous viral gene delivery vehicle to circumvent these phenomena. Since the finding that baculovirus can efficiently transduce mammalian cells, the applications of this viral system in gene delivery has greatly expanded and one advantage is the virtual absence of cytotoxicity in mammalian cells.\nContext 3: The transduction efficiency on human islets was significantly improved using RGD-modified adenovirus. HGF and XIAP gene expressions were dose-dependent after viral transduction. When exposed to a cocktail of inflammatory cytokines, RGD-Adv-hHGF-hXIAP-transduced human islets showed decreased caspase 3 activity and reduced apoptotic cell death. Prolonged normoglycemic control could be achieved by transplanting RGD-Adv-hHGF-hXIAP-transduced human islets. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections bearing RGD-Adv-hHGF-hXIAP-transduced human islets showed that the transduced cells were located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The transduced cells were also found to be located in the islet periphery. The trans", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) comprise a key corticolimbic circuit that helps shape individual differences in sensitivity to threat and the related risk for psychopathology. Although serotonin (5-HT) is known to be a key modulator of this circuit, the specific receptors mediating this modulation are unclear. The colocalization of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors on mPFC glutamatergic neurons suggests that their functional interactions may mediate 5-HT effects on this circuit through top-down regulation of amygdala reactivity. Using a multimodal neuroimaging strategy in 39 healthy volunteers, we determined whether threat-related amygdala reactivity, assessed with blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, was significantly predicted by the interaction between mPFC 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor levels, assessed by positron emission tomography.\nContext 2: 5-HT1A binding in the mPFC significantly moderated an inverse correlation between mPFC 5-HT2A binding and threat-related amygdala reactivity. Specifically, mPFC 5-HT2A binding was significantly inversely correlated with amygdala reactivity only when mPFC 5-HT1A binding was relatively low.\nContext 3: Here, using mice from 2 inbred strains widely exploited in behavioral neurochemistry, we investigated whether serotonin transmission in medial prefrontal cortex and GABA in basolateral amygdala determine strain-dependent liability to stress response and differences in coping.\nContext 4: C57BL/6J mice displayed greater immobility in the forced swimming test, higher serotonin outflow in medial prefrontal cortex, higher GABA outflow in basolateral amygdala induced by stress, and higher serotonin 1A receptor levels in medial prefrontal cortex accompanied by lower GABAb receptor levels in basolateral amygdala than DBA/2J mice. In assessing whether serotonin in medial prefrontal cortex determines GABA functioning in response to stress and passive coping behavior in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, we observed that selective prefrontal serotonin depletion in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J reduced stress-induced GABA outflow in basolateral amygdala and immobility in the forced swimming test.\nContext 5: Recent studies suggest that long-term exposure to stress can sensitize the amygdala to stress-induced fear. Here, we investigated whether serotonin transmission in medial prefrontal cortex and GABA in basolateral amygdala determine stress-induced fear and differences in coping in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice.\nContext 6: C57BL/6J mice displayed greater fear in the elevated plus maze, higher serotonin outflow in medial prefrontal cortex, higher GABA outflow in basolateral amygdala induced by stress, and higher serotonin 1A receptor levels in medial prefrontal cortex accompanied by lower GABAb receptor levels in basolateral amygdala than DBA/2J mice. In assessing whether serotonin in medial prefrontal cortex", "Yes, articular cartilage thickness measured with US is easy to measure and is well suited to monitor the decrease in articular cartilage thickness in osteoarthritis. Theoretically, the high spatial resolution of US makes it well suited to monitor the decrease in articular cartilage thickness in osteoarthritis. A requirement is, however, that the borders of the cartilage are correctly identified and that the cartilage is measured under orthogonal insonation. If US measurements are compared to measurements with other techniques, they should be corrected for the higher sound speed in cartilage.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into a host cell chromosome is an essential step under the control of the viral integrase (IN). Although this enzyme is necessary and sufficient to catalyze the integration reaction in vitro, cellular cofactors are involved in the process in vivo. The chromatin-associated factor LEDGF/p75 interacts with IN and promotes integration to transcription units of the host genome. HIV-1 IN also binds the karyopherin TNPO3, however the significance of this interaction during viral replication remains to be explored.\nContext 2: This was a 12-week, randomized, open-label pilot study comparing addition of the integrase inhibitor raltegravir to no treatment augmentation, with an option for rollover to raltegravir. CSF and plasma were analyzed for HIV-1 RNA using a single-copy assay. CSF and blood immune activation was assessed by neopterin concentrations and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell surface antigen expression.\nContext 3: Combination antiretroviral therapy suppresses but does not eradicate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in infected persons, and low-level viremia can be detected despite years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Short-course (28-day) intensification of standard antiretroviral combination therapy is a useful approach to determine whether complete rounds of HIV-1 replication in rapidly cycling cells contribute to persistent viremia. We investigated whether intensification with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir decreases plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in patients receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy.\nContext 4: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) favors integration in active genes of host chromatin. It is believed that transcriptional interference of the viral promoter over the endogenous gene or vice versa might occur with implications in HIV-1 post-integrative transcriptional latency.\nContext 5: Raltegravir (Isentress\u00ae)(RALT) has demonstrated excellent efficacy in both treatment-experienced and na\u00efve patients with HIV-1 infection, and is the first strand transfer integrase inhibitor to be approved for use in HIV infected adults worldwide. Since the in vivo efficacy of this class of antiviral drugs depends on their access to intracellular sites where HIV-1 replicates, we analyzed the biological effects induced by RALT on human MDR cell systems expressing multidrug resistance (MDR) genes.\nContext 6: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrates into the host genome and is maintained in a latent state in the nucleus of infected cells. The viral integrase (IN) is a key enzyme in this process. The IN is a homodimeric enzyme that contains two active sites, one for the synthesis of the viral DNA and the other for the ligation of the viral DNA to the host DNA. The IN is also a target for several antiretroviral drugs, including the integrase inhibitors (INIs). The IN is a target for several antiretroviral drugs, including the integrase inhibitors (INIs). The IN is a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Here, we have identified transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) as the important upstream signaling molecule that Vpr associates with in order to activate NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling. HIV-1 virion-associated Vpr is able to stimulate phosphorylation of TAK1. This activity of Vpr depends on its association with TAK1, since the S79A Vpr mutant lost interaction with TAK1 and was unable to activate TAK1. This association allows Vpr to promote the interaction of TAB3 with TAK1 and increase the polyubiquitination of TAK1, which renders TAK1 phosphorylation. In further support of the key role of TAK1 in this function of Vpr, knockdown of endogenous TAK1 significantly attenuated the ability of Vpr to activate NF-\u03baB and AP-1 as well as the ability to stimulate HIV-1 LTR promoter.\nContext 2: The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plays an important role in viral replication. It has been reported that Vpr stimulates the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathways, and thereby regulates viral and host cell gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism behind this function of Vpr is not fully understood.\nContext 3: During early HIV-1 infection of CD4 T-lymphocytes, many host protein tyrosine kinases become activated within minutes, including phosphoprotein pp60 (c-Src) and the focal adhesion kinase family member, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2). Whether their activation facilitates or impedes infection remains to be determined.\nContext 4: Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) exhibits a wide range of interactions with the host cell but whether viral proteins interact with cellular RNA is not clear. A candidate interacting factor is the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein. Tat is required for expression of virus genes but activates transcription through an unusual mechanism; binding to an RNA stem-loop, the transactivation response element (TAR), with the host elongation factor P-TEFb. HIV-1 Tat has also been shown to alter the expression of host genes during infection, contributing to viral pathogenesis but, whether Tat also interacts with cellular RNAs is unknown.\nContext 5: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr protein is a key regulator of viral replication. Vpr is a multifunctional protein that can activate the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathways, and thereby regulates viral and host cell gene expression. However, the molecular mechanism behind this function of Vpr is not fully understood.\nContext 6: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr protein is a key regulator of viral replication. Vpr is a multifunctional protein that can activate the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and activator protein", "Question: Do dynamic splints reduce contracture following distal radial fracture?\nContext 1: Do dynamic splints reduce contracture following distal radial fracture?\nContext 2: Forty outpatients with contracture following distal radial fracture.\nContext 3: The intrinsic stability of fractures related to soft tissue injury and the comminution of the metaphyseal part of the distal radius influence the chance of secondary displacement in distal radial fractures treated conservatively. A low bone mineral density may also contribute to this secondary displacement and could therefore play a role in functional outcome. This possible relation between functional outcome and bone mineral density is poorly studied.\nContext 4: A splint holding the ankle in maximum dorsiflexion was worn nightly", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Bifenazate is a carbazate acaricide known for its potency, particularly against tetranychid mite species such as the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). It was recently shown that the compound needs to be activated by an S,S,S-tributyl-phosphorotrithioate (DEF)-sensitive mechanism in spider mites to display full acaricidal efficacy. The ability of well-known organophosphates and carbamates to inhibit the activation of bifenazate and thus compromise its acaricidal potential was tested.\nContext 2: Esterase activity determined in vivo after pre-exposure of mites with organophosphates and carbamates revealed--depending on the compound--varying esterase inhibition nicely correlated with the ability of the individual compound to antagonise bifenazate action on mites.\nContext 3: Entomopathogenic fungi, Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, are promising bio-pesticides for application against adult malaria mosquito vectors. An understanding of the behavioural responses of mosquitoes towards these fungi is necessary to guide development of fungi beyond the 'proof of concept' stage and to design suitable intervention tools.\nContext 4: Chrysomela populi (poplar leaf beetle) is a common herbivore in poplar plantations whose infestation causes major economic losses. Because plant volatiles act as infochemicals, we tested whether isoprene, the main volatile organic compound (VOC) produced by poplars (Populus x canescens), affects the performance of C. populi employing isoprene emitting (IE) and transgenic isoprene non-emitting (NE) plants. Our hypothesis was that isoprene is sensed and affects beetle orientation or that the lack of isoprene affects plant VOC profiles and metabolome with consequences for C. populi feeding.\nContext 5: Electroantennographic analysis revealed that C. populi can detect higher terpenes, but not isoprene. In accordance to the inability to detect isoprene, C. populi showed no clear preference for IE or NE poplar genotypes in the choice experiments, however, the beetles consumed a little bit less leaf mass and laid fewer eggs on NE poplar trees in field experiments. Slight differences in the profiles of volatile terpenes between the genotypes were detected by GC-MS.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of isoprene on the performance of C. populi in the field. We found that C. populi preferred the NE poplar genotype in the choice experiments. In the field, the beetles consumed a little bit less leaf mass and laid fewer eggs on NE poplar trees. Slight differences in the profiles of volatile terpenes between the genotypes were detected by GC-MS.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of isoprene on the performance of C. populi in the field. We found that C. populi preferred the NE poplar genotype in", "Question: Are fetal osteocalcin levels related to placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in humans??\nExplanation: The placenta is the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. It also removes waste products from the fetus. The placenta is made up of two layers, the chorion and the decidua. The decidua is the outer layer of the placenta that is made up of the villi. The villi are the finger-like projections that are found on the surface of the placenta. The villi are made up of a single layer of cells called the syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast is the layer of cells that make", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We sought to evaluate the association between constipation severity, productivity losses and healthcare utilization in a national sample of Italian patients with chronic non-organic constipation (CC).\nContext 2: Mean PAC-SYM score was 1.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69. Mean weekly sick time due to constipation was 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\u2009h and productivity losses due to presenteeism was 19.7%\u2009\u00b1\u200922.3%. Adjusted productivity losses in patients with severe CC (PAC-SYM score 2.3-4.0) compared to patients with mild symptoms (PAC-SYM score 0.0-1.0) was Italian Purchase Power Parity US$ 6160. Constipation severity (PAC-SYM quintiles) was associated with higher healthcare utilization (RRPAC-SYM 4/01.84; p-value for linear trend <0.01). After adjustment for somatization scores, the association of constipation severity with productivity losses and healthcare utilization rates was attenuated yet statistically significant.\nContext 3: Symptomatic outcome, patients' satisfaction, and morbidity. Outcome was based mainly on the validated KESS score, which covers 10 symptoms included in the definiton of constipation.\nContext 4: There was a significant reduction in all 10 symptoms. Two patients complained of incontinence which improved after operation. The number of patients with constipation was reduced from 20 to 8 (p = 0.000) and none became constipated. Mean (95% CI) colonic transit times before and after operation in 10 patients with constipation were 5.3 (4.1 to 6.4) and 4.0 (2.6 to 5.4) days (p = 0.083). Seven of these 10 patients had a reduction of both transit time and constipation score. Six patients had complications after open operations. These included one damaged ureter, reoperations for bleeding, incomplete intestinal obstruction, and 2 wound infections.\nContext 5: We enrolled 878 outpatients with CC. Clinical and demographic data were collected by physicians during clinical examinations. Patients completed a self-administered questionnaire (Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms, PAC-SYM; Work Productivity and Activity Impairment; healthcare utilization, and Symptoms Checklist 90 Revised - Somatization Scale, SCL-90\u2009R). The mean age was 55.5\u2009\u00b1\u200915.1 years, 60.5% were women, and 60.5% were married. The mean PAC-SYM score was 1.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69. Mean weekly sick time due to constipation was 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20098.6\u2009h and productivity losses due to presenteeism was 19.7%\u2009\u00b1\u200922.3%.

Motility and viability remained high (49% +/- 3% and 70% +/- 2%, respectively) and thus the percentage of live reacted spermatozoa was 27% +/- 5%. Incubation with A23187 (5 mumol/L for 30 minutes) gave similar results for the percentage of live reacted", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Disulfiram and its primary metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate are effective mechanism-based inhibitors of human liver cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in vitro. A single dose of disulfiram, which significantly diminishes human P450 2E1 activity in vivo, has been used to investigate the role of CYP2E1 in human drug metabolism and to prevent CYP2E1-mediated biotransformation. Nevertheless, the specificity of single-dose disulfiram toward human CYP2E1 in vivo is unknown. Because diethyldithiocarbamate also inhibits human liver CYP2A6 in vitro, this investigation explored the effect of single-dose disulfiram on human CYP2A6 activity in vivo.\nContext 2: CYP2A6 activity was assessed by the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin, which is catalyzed selectively by CYP2A6. Ten healthy volunteers received 50 mg oral coumarin on two occasions in a randomized crossover design, approximately 10 hours after 500 mg oral disulfiram was administered or after no pretreatment (control group). Plasma and urine 7-hydroxycoumarin and plasma coumarin concentrations were determined by HPLC.\nContext 3: We reported recently that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 substrate metoprolol in volunteers. Valdecoxib, the active metabolite of parecoxib, has also been claimed to interfere with the metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates. However, little support for this contention is available despite the intensive use of parecoxib in the perioperative setting. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of valdecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of the clinically relevant CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol.\nContext 4: 2-D electrophoresis showed that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was up-regulated 5-fold in the breast epithelial cells exposed to zeranol. PDI has been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of cancerous tissues, although this is the first reported up-regulation of PDI in breast tissue.\nContext 5: Beta-Blocker use can be associated with adverse effects that may have an impact on adherence or harm patients. The commonly used beta-blockers, metoprolol and propranolol, are metabolized by CYP2D6. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CYP2D6 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and propranolol.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CYP2D6 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and propranolol.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CYP2D6 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol and propranolol.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CYP2", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The T-455C and C-482T APOC3 promoter region polymorphisms (SNPs) have recently been reported to predispose to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Indian subjects, but the association with liver damage has not been evaluated so far. The aim was to assess the association between APOC3 SNPs and liver damage in Caucasian patients.\nContext 2: APOC3 SNPs were not associated with NAFLD in Italian subjects, although a borderline significance for the transmission of the -455T allele was observed in the family study. Homozygosity for the APOC3 wild-type genotype (APOC3 WT) was associated with a more favorable lipid profile in control subjects, and consistently with lower hepatic APOC3 mRNA levels in obese patients without diabetes. However, APOC3 SNPs, alone or in combination, were not associated with insulin resistance, altered lipid levels, liver enzymes, and with liver damage (severity of steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and moderate/severe fibrosis) in Italian as well as in UK patients, and in the whole cohort. Stratification for the I148M PNPLA3 mutation, associated with the susceptibility to NASH, did not alter the results.\nContext 3: It has not been solved whether subjects carrying the minor alleles of the -455T>C or -482C>T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the apolipoprotein-C3-gene (APOC3) have an increased risk for developing fatty liver and insulin resistance. We investigated the relationships of the SNPs with hepatic APOC3 expression and hypothesized that visceral obesity may modulate the effects of these SNPs on liver fat and insulin sensitivity (IS).\nContext 4: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an inflammatory disease that in some patients leads to exocrine and endocrine dysfunction. In industrialized countries the most common aetiology is chronic alcohol abuse. Descriptions of associated genetic alterations in alcoholic CP are rare. However, a common PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) is associated with the development of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC). Since, alcoholic CP and ALC share the same aetiology PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) possibly influences the development of alcoholic CP.\nContext 5: We tested the putative association of the PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) with the development of alcoholic CP in a cohort of 100 patients with alcoholic CP and 100 age- and sex-matched controls.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) with the development of alcoholic pancreatitis (AP) in a cohort of 100 patients with AP and 100 age- and sex-matched controls.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the PNPLA3 variant (p.I148M) with the development of alcoholic pancreatitis (AP) in a cohort of 100 patients with AP and 100 age- and", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Peritoneal fibrosis was induced by injection of chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) into the peritoneal cavity of mice every other day for 3 weeks. An analog of vitamin D, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), was administered subcutaneously daily from initiation of the CG injections. The peritoneal tissue was excised at 3 weeks. Changes in morphology were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Expression of VDR, alpha smooth muscle actin (as a marker of myofibroblasts), type III collagen, transforming growth factor \u03b2(TGF-\u03b2), phosphorylated Smad2/3, F4/80 (as a marker of macrophages), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was examined by immunohistochemistry. Southwestern histochemistry was used to detect activated nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB).\nContext 2: To determine the role of the TF/FVIIa complex in the host response to peritonitis, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of live Escherichia coli with or without concurrent treatment with recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), a selective inhibitor of the TF/FVIIa pathway.\nContext 3: Peritonitis was associated with an increase in the expression of TF at the tissue level and activation of coagulation, as reflected by elevated levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and by increased fibrin(ogen) deposition in the liver and lungs. rNAPc2 strongly attenuated this procoagulant response but did not influence the inflammatory response (histopathology, leukocyte recruitment to the peritoneal cavity, and cytokine and chemokine levels). Moreover, rNAPc2 did not alter bacterial outgrowth locally or dissemination of the infection, and survival was not different between rNAPc2-treated mice and control mice.\nContext 4: In the CG-injected mice, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of VDR in mesothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and macrophages in the thickened submesothelial zone. Treatment with OCT significantly prevented peritoneal fibrosis and reduced the accumulation of type III collagen in CG-treated mice. Among the markers of fibrosis, the numbers of myofibroblasts, cells positive for TGF-\u03b2, and activated NF-\u03baB were significantly reduced in OCT-treated mice. In addition, OCT treatment significantly reduced the expression of MCP-1 and F4/80 in the peritoneal cavity. These results suggest that OCT may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of peritoneal fibrosis.\nContext 5: The TF/FVIIa complex is a key regulator of coagulation and inflammation. The present study was designed to determine the role of the TF/FVIIa complex in the host response to peritonitis.

The evaluation using dominant and recessive models also did not reveal any significant associations. The haplotype analysis with a variable-sized sliding-window strategy also showed a lack of association of IGF-1 SNPs with high or extreme myopia.\nContext 3: A total of 1,339 unrelated Japanese patients with high myopia (axial length \u226526 mm in both eyes) and two independent control groups were evaluated (334 cataract patients without high myopia and 1,194 healthy Japanese individuals). The mean axial length (mm\u00b1SD) in the case group was 29.18\u00b11.85 mm, and the mean spherical equivalent (D\u00b1SD) of the phakic eyes was -12.69\u00b14.54 D. We genotyped five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IGF-1: rs6214, rs978458, rs5742632, rs12423791, and rs2162679. Chi-square tests for trend, multivariable logistic regression, and haplotype regression analysis were conducted.\nContext 4: High myopia is a common complex-trait eye disorder, with implications for blindness due to increased risk of retinal detachment, macular degeneration, premature cataracts, and glaucoma. Mapping studies have identified at least four loci for nonsyndromic autosomal dominant high myopia at 18p11.31, 12q22-q23, 17q21-q23, and 7q36. The smallest haplotyped interval for these loci is that of the MYP2 locus on 18p11.31.

In this study, the authors investigated the prevalence and biological significance of Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) overexpression in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.\nContext 2: Microarray analysis revealed overexpression of Aurora kinase B, a chromosome passenger protein kinase, as the most significant predictor of the aggressive recurrence of HCC. Aurora kinase B protein expression was significantly associated with aggressive recurrence (P < 0.001) and prognosis (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified Aurora kinase B as the only independent predictor of aggressive recurrence of HCC (P = 0.031). Array-CGH analysis showed that genomic instability was closely related to Aurora kinase B expression (P = 0.011).\nContext 3: The expression of Aurora-A gene studied was significantly deregulated, with an increasing level in cancer versus normal tissue Aurora-A. This development was linear. Aurora-A was already deregulated in early stages of carcinogenesis (pTa/pT1) (P = 0.0004) and displayed even more deregulation in muscle-invasive stages (pT2 to pT4). Immunohistochemistry performed on the same samples using Aurora-A antibody confirmed results of RT-PCR, with statistically significant values when comparing m-RNA expression and immunohistochemical values (P = 0.0001).\nContext 4: Frequent overexpression of AURKA transcript in upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas was detected compared with normal samples (47%; P=.001). The immunohistochemical analysis of 130 tumors demonstrated moderate-to-strong immunostaining of AURKA in >50% of upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. By using camptothecin as a drug-induced apoptosis in vitro model, the authors demonstrated that the expression of AURKA provided protection against apoptosis to gastrointestinal cancer cells (AGS and RKO) (P=.006) and RIE-1 primary intestinal epithelial cells (P=.001). The AURKA overexpression mediated an increase in phosphorylation of AKT(Ser473) with an increase in HDM2 level. The shRNA-knockdown of AKT in AURKA-overexpressing cells reversed this effect and showed a significant increase in the p53 protein level, indicating a possible nexus of AURKA/AKT/p53. Indeed, overexpression of AURKA led to a significant increase in the p53 protein level in AGS and RKO cells (P=.001). The authors also demonstrated that AURKA overexpression in AGS and RKO cells was associated with a significant increase in the p53 protein level (P=.001). The authors also demonstrated that AURKA overexpression in AGS and RKO cells was associated with a significant increase in the p53 protein level (P=.001).

We analyzed the presence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), arteriolar hyalinosis (AH), intimal thickness (IT), interstitial fibrosis (IF) and glomerulosclerosis (GS). We also analyzed the impact of donor features on the following outcomes: delayed graft function (DGF) and chronic allograft dysfunction defined as eGFR < 60\u2009mL/min at 1 year.\nContext 2: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) kidney damage is an important factor for allograft survival in kidney transplantation. Recently it has been shown that immune factors from donor-derived cells are important in IR injury. The aim of this article was to evaluate the impact of short-term immunosuppressive treatment of the donor over a time frame relevant to cadaveric transplantation on IR damage to the rat kidney.\nContext 3: Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a risk for acute renal failure and delayed graft function in renal transplantation and cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether propofol could attenuate renal IRI and explore related mechanism.\nContext 4: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an unavoidable component of transplantation and correlates with delayed graft function, acute rejection, chronic fibrosis, and graft loss. Currently, new donor pools are considered to alleviate pressure on waiting lists, such as deceased after cardiac death donors (DCD) and extended criteria donors. Because these organs are particularly sensitive to IRI, there is a need for novel preservation paradigms. We assessed the effect of anticoagulation therapy during graft preservation on IRI and graft outcome.\nContext 5: Mean infant aortic blood flows were 331+/-148 ml/min before transplantation, 761+/-272 ml/ min at 8-12 days after transplantation (P=0.0006 with pretransplant flow), and 665+/-138 ml/min at 4-6 months after transplantation (P=0.0001 with pretransplant flow). Mean transplanted renal artery flows were 385+/-158 ml/min at 8-12 days and 296+/-113 ml/min at 4-6 months after transplantation. Transplanted renal artery flows were less than prenephrectomy in 10 of 12 patients (83%) at 8-12 days and in 9 of 12 patients (75%) at 4-6 months after transplantation.

Although gallbladder inflammation is believed to be common during cholelithogenesis, the role of immunologic factors is unknown.\nContext 2: When fed a lithogenic diet for 8 weeks, wild-type mice developed significantly more cholesterol gallstones (27%-80% prevalence) than Rag mice ( approximately 5%, P <.05). Helicobacter spp.-infected BALB/cJ mice displayed statistically significant increases in cholesterol gallstone prevalence compared with uninfected mice (81% vs. 39%; P <.05). Transfer of splenocytes or T lymphocytes to Rag2(-/-) mice increased stone prevalence markedly (26% and 40% respectively; P <.05), whereas transfer of B cells was not appreciably cholelithogenic (13%). The adaptive immune response increased the expression of gallbladder Muc genes and accumulation of mucin gel. In addition, T cells and cholesterol monohydrate crystals induced proinflammatory gene expression in the gallbladder, which likely contributes to gallbladder dysfunction.\nContext 3: Four main disturbances have been attributed to cholesterol gallstone disease: hypersecretion of cholesterol from the liver with cholesterol supersaturation in bile; disturbed motility with defective absorption and secretion by the gallbladder; increased crystallisation of cholesterol in the gallbladder bile; and slow intestinal transit with increased amount of deoxycholic acid in the bile acid pool. We aimed to evaluate the biliary lipid composition in a large series of gallstone patients, with emphasis on the amount of deoxycholic acid and with respect to number of stones, compared to gallstone free subjects.\nContext 4: Patients with cholesterol gallstone (CGS group) and patients without cholesterol gallstones (non-CGS group) were enrolled. The serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and biliary composition were analyzed. Eight liver samples from two patients without CGS and six patients with CGS were subjected to cDNA microarray analysis. Hepatic CPE expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. Plasma CCK level was measured by ELISA.\nContext 5: Decreased carboxypeptidase E (CPE) expression is associated with numerous pathophysiological conditions. This study aimed to investigate the potential function of hepatic CPE in the pathogenesis of CGS. Hepatic CPE expression was decreased in CGS patients compared with non-CGS patients. Hepatic CPE expression was positively correlated with serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Hepatic CPE expression was negatively correlated with serum CCK level.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether propofol is safely used for patients with allergy or bronchial asthma.\nContext 2: The number of patients who had wheezing was significantly larger in Propofol-allergy group than in other groups.\nContext 3: Seventy females with bronchial asthma or allergic diseases and 70 females without any allergic diseases for mastectomy were randomly allocated to propofol group (Propofol-allergy group and Propofol-non-allergy group) or sevoflurane group (Sevoflurane-allergy group and Sevoflurane-non-allergy group). In the propofol group, anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with propofol, fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. In the sevoflurane group, anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl, and maintained with sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Wheezing detected by auscultation, increase of inspiratory pressure and change of the waveform of end-tidal carbon dioxide, and allergic reaction detected by skin rash during anesthesia were compared among the groups.\nContext 4: Twice-daily inhaled salmeterol produces rapid reduction in its acute bronchoprotective effect against methacholine in patients with mild asthma. This investigation examined this effect in patients with moderate asthma who were using inhaled corticosteroids.\nContext 5: Exposure caused an increase of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine by 3.2 doubling concentration steps (25 to 75th percentiles, 2.8 to 4.1) and 2.6 doubling concentration steps (25 to 75th percentiles, 1.4 to 3.7) in the placebo and salmeterol groups (2 weeks), respectively, with no significant differences between the groups (p = 0.3; part 1). Similar results were obtained when salmeterol was administered as a single dose (part 2) prior to exposure. However, salmeterol significantly attenuated the bronchial responsiveness to methacholine by 1.2 doubling concentration steps (0.8 to 1.5) in the placebo group (part 1) and by 1.1 doubling concentration steps (0.8 to 1.4) in the salmeterol group (part 2) (p = 0.02; part 1) and 1.1 doubling concentration steps (0.8 to 1.4) in the salmeterol group (part 2) (p = 0.02; part 1) (p = 0.02; part 1) and 1.1 doubling concentration steps (0.8 to 1.4) in the salmeterol group (part 2) (p = 0.02; part 1) (p =", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Soft tissue balancing is crucial to the success of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To create a rectangular flexion joint gap, the rotation of the femoral component is important. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not anatomical landmarks of the distal femoral condyles are parallel to the tibial bone cut surface in flexion.\nContext 2: Fifty-two non-paired human cadaver knees were used. All soft tissues around the knee were resected except the ACL. The ACL was cut in the middle, and the femoral bone was cut at the most proximal point of the femoral notch parallel to the plane of the femoral bone shaft. The ACL was carefully dissected, and the periphery of the ACL insertion site was outlined on the femoral side. An accurate lateral view of the femoral condyle was photographed with a digital camera, and the images were downloaded to a personal computer. The morphological variations of Blumensaat's line, the height and area of the lateral wall of the femoral intercondylar notch and the size of the femoral ACL footprints were measured with Image J software.\nContext 3: Posterior femoral condyle bone resection thickness differed between prostheses. Change in size of the medial posterior condyle ranged from -0.5 to 1.4\u00a0mm at 0\u00b0 external rotation, from -2.9 to 1.4\u00a0mm at 3\u00b0 external rotation, and from -5.3 to 1.4\u00a0mm at 6\u00b0 external rotation. Change in size of lateral posterior condyle ranged from -0.5 to 1.4\u00a0mm at 0\u00b0 external rotation, from -0.4 to 3.4\u00a0mm at 3\u00b0 external rotation, and from -0.4 to 5.3\u00a0mm at 6\u00b0 external rotation.\nContext 4: Thickness of posterior femoral condyle bone resection and thickness of prostheses were investigated in 8 types of total knee prostheses using the production drawings provided by the manufacturers.\nContext 5: Three different cams (triangle, ellipse, and circle) and three different posts (straight, convex, concave) geometries were considered in this study and were analysed using kinematic analyses. Femoral rollback did not occur until reaching 50\u00b0 of knee flexion. Beyond this angle, two of the nine combinations demonstrate poor knee kinematics. The ellipse and circle cams and the straight post demonstrated the best knee kinematics. The convex post demonstrated the worst knee kinematics.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the femoral component rotation on the kinematics of the knee.

Patients who had thrombus aspiration were younger, had lower rates of previous myocardial infarction but were more likely to have poor left ventricular function. Procedural success rates were higher (90.9% vs. 89.2%; p=0.005) and in-hospital major adverse cardiac event rates were lower (4.4% vs. 5.5%; p=0.012) in patients undergoing thrombus aspiration. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no significant difference in mortality rates between patients with and without thrombus aspiration (14.8% aspiration vs. 15.3% PCI only; p=0.737) during the follow-up period. After multivariate Cox analysis (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 1.23) and the addition of propensity matching (HR: 0.85 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.20) thrombus aspiration was still not associated with decreased mortality.\nContext 4: The beneficial role of manual thrombus aspiration in thrombus-containing lesions has been proven in acute myocardial infarction but data is lacking in saphenous vein graft lesions.\nContext 5: Primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PPCI) with short DTB time offer mortality benefit for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction but literatures are conflicting on this benefit for high- vs. low-risk patients. In a unique model at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals, five interventional cardiologists provide 24-h PPCI at whichever one of its two DGH that patients present to. A retrospective audit was performed on 3 years (July 2005-June 2008) of PPCI data in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database. Data were analysed in four periods corresponding to change from daytime-only to 24-h PPCI. DTB time and in-hospital mortality were the main outcome measures.\n\nBased on the results of the study, the authors concluded that thrombus aspiration is not associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention.", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The cytosol of the retina contains a number of soluble binding proteins (BP) for fatty acids (FA), particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Blood was drawn at 28-30 weeks for the measurement of haemoglobin, mean cell volume, serum ferritin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity. These results were compared between mothers with a postpartum day 3 haemoglobin of > or = 10 g/dl and those < 10 g/dl. Statistical analysis was performed with parametric and non-parametric methods as appropriate.\nContext 4: The regular provision of iron led to improved iron status during and for some months after the intervention. Both sources of iron were about equally effective. Iron affected stool color but had no effect on feeding-related behavior. However, medicinal iron was associated with a small but significant reduction in length gain and a trend toward reduced weight gain. ID anemia was observed in 4 infants (2.3%), most of whom had a low birth iron endowment. Mild ID was common in the second year of life.\nContext 5: Anaemia (Hb <12 g dl(-1)) and iron deficiency (ferritin <15 microg l(-1)) were prevalent in 16.0 and 27.2% of the study sample, respectively.

For this reason, several papers focused on the use of biochemical markers (S100B, neuron-specific enolase) to detect and define the severity of brain damage and predict outcome after traumatic head injury or cardiac arrest.\nContext 3: We investigated 58 patients with completed stroke who were admitted to the stroke unit of the Department of Neurology at Magdeburg University. Serial venous blood samples were taken after admission and during the first 4 days, and protein S-100B and NSE were analyzed by the use of immunoluminometric assays. In all patients, lesion topography and vascular supply were analyzed and volume of infarcted brain areas was calculated. The neurological status was evaluated by a standardized neurological examination and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, at days 1 and 4 on the stroke unit, at day 10, and at discharge from the hospital. Comprehensive neuropsychological examinations were performed in all patients with first-ever stroke event and supratentorial brain infarctions. Functional outcome was measured with the Barthel score at discharge from the hospital.\nContext 4: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neuroplasticity. Further, exogenous treatment with BDNF or exposing animals to enrichment and exercise regimens, which also increase BDNF, enhances behavioral recovery after brain injury. Thus, the beneficial effects of rehabilitation in promoting recovery after stroke may also depend on BDNF. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the contribution of BDNF to motor skill relearning after endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.\nContext 5: Prospectively collected data from 889 consecutive patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively analysed. Patients who suffered a recurrent ischemic stroke (n=22) or died (n=30) during the follow-up period were excluded from this study. The remaining 827 patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of a previous history of transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of a new stroke during the follow-up period. The secondary outcome measures were the occurrence of a new TIA and the occurrence of a new stroke in the first 30 days after the index stroke.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 4-week exercise program on the neurobehavioral outcome of patients with first-ever stroke. The study was conducted in a university hospital stroke unit. The patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=30) or an exercise group (n=30). The exercise group performed", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Recently a retrospective study has been published describing a significant correlation of immediate postoperative leukocytosis (IPLC) and a favorable pathological Gleason score (pGS) in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). The aim of the present study was to prospectively validate these results on an external dataset.\nContext 2: Between April 1993 and February 1997, 238 patients underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and whole mounted specimens were processed at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Cases were reviewed by 2 pathologists (W. Z. and I. A. S.) blinded to clinical information, and scored for inflammation as 0--rare; 1--mild, 10 to 15 small foci; 2--moderate, greater than 15 foci with a large area or greater than 20 small foci; 3--marked, greater than 20 small foci with a large area, and 4--diffuse, multiple large areas. The extent of inflammation was correlated to pretreatment PSA and other variables.\nContext 3: A total of 93 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens were processed as whole mounts. Tissue sections were analyzed and the pathological outcomes measured included Gleason score, surgical margin status, and presence or absence of extraprostatic tumor extension and/or seminal vesicle invasion. The pathological outcomes of the preceding cohort were compared to those of a similar cohort consisting of 554 men whose radical prostatectomy specimens were processed as partially submitted glands.\nContext 4: We retrospectively analyzed 1,880 cases of RP. Baseline characteristics were analyzed. Locations of the PSM were recorded in the four surgery groups as apex, anterior, posterolateral, and base and were analyzed by using chi-square test. The association of the location of the PSM with the BCR rate was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis according to the type of surgery, which included radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP, n=633), radical retroperitoneal prostatectomy (RRP, n=309), laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP, n=164), and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP, n=774).\nContext 5: We retrospectively reviewed our institution's radical prostatectomy (RP) database from 1991 to 2007 and identified 1,880 patients. The median age was 66 years (range, 30 to 90 years). The median PSA was 10.5 ng/mL (range, 0.1 to 5,000 ng/mL). The median follow-up was 5.5 years (range, 0.1 to 15.5 years). The median number of positive lymph nodes was 1 (range, 0 to 10). The median number of positive surgical margins was 0 (range, 0 to 4). The median number of positive lymph nodes was 1 (range, 0 to 10). The median number of positive surgical margins was 0 (range, 0 to 4).

Survival, development time and fecundity of this spider were not different when they were fed with Bt rice-fed or non-Bt rice-fed prey. Furthermore, ELISA and PCR gut assays, as well as a functional response trial, indicated that predation by P. pseudoannulata was not significantly different in Bt rice or non-Bt rice fields.\nContext 2: The commercial release of rice genetically engineered to express a Cry1Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for control of Lepidoptera in China is a subject of debate. One major point of the debate has focused on the ecological safety of Bt rice on nontarget organisms, especially predators and parasitoids that help control populations of insect pests.\nContext 3: Agrotis ipsilon demonstrated an initial, post-ingestive aversive response to Cry1F maize. Development and mortality were also affected - survival on Cry1F maize tissue was 40% and weight gain of survivors of Cry1F exposure was significantly reduced. A post-ingestive aversive response was also seen for Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 maize; however, longer-term feeding, weight gain and survival were not affected.\nContext 4: Organisms may respond to environmental change by means of genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity or both, which may result in genotype-environment interactions (G x E) if genotypes differ in their phenotypic response. We here specifically target the latter source of variation (i.e. G x E) by comparing plastic responses among lines of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana that had been selected for increased cold tolerance and according controls. Our main aim here was to test the hypothesis that directional selection on cold tolerance will interfere with plastic capacities.\nContext 5: Although Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize has been widely adopted in diverse regions around the world, relatively little is known about the susceptibility and behavioral response of certain insect pests to Bt maize in countries where this maize is not currently cultivated. These are important factors to consider as management plans are developed. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility and behavioral response of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis (Walker), to Bt maize in the field and laboratory.\nContext 6: The potential for Cry1Ab maize to affect the fitness of natural enemies of Lepidoptera is a major concern for the commercial release of Bt maize in China. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Cry1Ab maize on the fitness of natural enemies of Lepidoptera. The effects of Cry1Ab maize on the fitness of natural enemies of Lepidoptera were investigated in the field and laboratory.\nContext 7: The potential for Cry1Ab maize to affect the fitness of natural enemies of Lepidoptera is a major concern for", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Significantly increased PAFr expression in small airway epithelium of all clinical groups was found compared with controls (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, epithelial PAFr expression was upregulated in COPD smokers compared with NLFS (P\u2009<\u20090.05), but not when compared with COPD ex-smokers or patients with only small airways disease. Smoking history (pack-year) correlated significantly with PAFr expression in the currently smoking individuals, especially in NLFS (r\u2009=\u20090.9; P\u2009<\u20090.002). An increase above normal in PAFr-expressing cells in the airway epithelial Rbm was only significant in COPD smokers (P\u2009<\u20090.007). An upregulation of PAFr-expressing cell in alveolar epithelium was uniformly found in all clinical groups compared with normal control (P\u2009<\u20090.01).\nContext 2: PAFr is a cell adhesion site for specific bacteria, notably non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We previously published that PAFr expression is significantly upregulated in the large airways of smokers, especially in COPD. We have now investigated PAFr expression in the epithelium and Rbm of small airways and in the alveolar compartment in smokers and patients with both COPD and small airway disease.\nContext 3: To investigate the activation of innate immunity and inflammasome pathways in the bronchial mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with stable COPD of different severity and control healthy smokers and non-smokers.\nContext 4: We evaluated PAFr expression cross-sectionally in resected lung tissue from: eight smokers with normal lung function (NLFS); 10 with smoking-related small airway narrowing only; eight COPD smokers; 10 COPD ex-smokers, and compared these with nine control tissues. Anti-PAFr immunostaining was quantified using computer-aided image analysis.\nContext 5: We hypothesized that bronchodilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases the smoke-related risk to develop cardiovascular disease, and aimed to study the effect of short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilation and smoking on cardiovascular events.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, or maybe.

We tested the hypothesis that these adipocytokines contribute to chronic HCV-associated IR and liver injury by first comparing their serum levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 154 untreated, non-diabetic, HCV-infected male subjects with fibrosis stage 0-2, to that in 75 healthy volunteers matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR). We next examined whether the adipocytokine levels were associated with the extent of hepatic steatosis, portal/periportal inflammation and fibrosis in our total cohort of 240 HCV-infected male subjects. Significantly higher levels of HOMA-IR (2.12 versus 1.63, P = 0.01), TNFalpha (1.28 versus 0.60 pg/ml, P < 0.001) and IL6 (2.42 versus 1.15 pg/ml, P = 0.001) were noted in the HCV cohort compared with healthy controls respectively, but there were no significant differences in leptin and adiponectin concentrations. By multiple linear regression, independent predictors of HOMA-IR included the body mass index, and the serum levels of leptin (positive correlation) and adiponectin (negative correlation), but not that of TNFalpha and IL6. Only TNFalpha levels were correlated with the extent of histological injury (portal/periportal inflammation, P = 0.02).\nContext 2: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) induces insulin resistance (IR) and subsequently diabetes.\nContext 3: The role of insulin resistance in predicting virological response to therapy of chronic hepatitis C is debated. We assessed the association between basal (defined as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)>2) and post-load insulin resistance (as oral glucose insulin sensitivity index<9.8 mg/kg/min) with the rapid and sustained virological responses in chronic hepatitis C.\nContext 4: Visceral adiposity is associated with hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

The present study examined these and other medications reported to affect I-mIBG uptake using measurements of cardiac I-mIBG uptake on the heart failure (HF) patients in the ADMIRE-HF extension (X) study.\nContext 2: Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignancy, and most tumor cells express the norepinephrine transporter (NET) enabling uptake of NET ligands. Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a NET-specific ligand used as a highly specific imaging agent and targeted radiotherapeutic. Patients with neuroblastoma frequently require sedation during targeted radiotherapy. Dexmedetomidine has been increasingly used to achieve efficacious sedation. There are theoretical concerns that this highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist may interfere with active uptake of MIBG through the NET transporter. In this study, we analyzed the impact of [125-iodine]-labeled MIBG ([\nContext 3: The relative risk (RR) was 2.71 (95% CI, 1.31-5.61) and the number of patients that needed to be treated (NNT) was 1.85 (95% CI, 1.19-4.21) to observe one additional patient with drowsiness 15 minutes after sedation in the dexmedetomidine group.

Like human peripheral blood, the peripheral blood of scrapie-infected sheep remains one possible source of disease transmission. As a first step in understanding the disease requirements in the natural scrapie host, the presence of PrPc was evaluated in peripheral blood cells from five normal and five scrapie-infected Suffolk sheep.\nContext 2: PrP mRNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but not in platelets or granulocytes. Consistent with PrP mRNA expression, cell-surface expressed PrP was detected on PBMC, but was not detected on granulocytes, platelets, or erythrocytes. Two-color flow cytometric analysis of PBMC specific phenotypes revealed that regardless of scrapie-status, expression of PrP was significantly higher on B2 positive B-lymphocytes than on CD4, CD8, WC1 positive T-lymphocytes or CD14 positive monocytes. In addition, PrP expressed on PBMC from normal and scrapie-infected sheep was sensitive to proteinase K (PK)and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC).\nContext 3: Live peripheral blood cells from normal and scrapie-infected sheep were analyzed for the presence of PrP using flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\nContext 4: In sheep, susceptibility to scrapie, which is similar to human prion diseases such as Kuru and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), is determined by prion protein (PrP) gene (Prnp) polymorphisms. Sheep with genotype ARQ/ARQ, denoting polymorphisms at codons 136, 154, and 171, are susceptible, whereas those with genotypes ARR/ARQ and ARR/ARR are resistant, indicating dominance of ARR over the ARQ allele.\nContext 5: To obtain an insight into the function of cellular prion protein (PrPC), we studied PrPC-interacting proteins (PrPIPs) by analysing a protein microarray.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\nYes, PrPc is expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nMaybe, PrPc is expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.\nNo, PrPc is not expressed in normal sheep peripheral blood cells.", "definitely yes\nExplanation: Microbleeds are associated with cognitive decline in patients with ischemic stroke.

We performed 3 analyses. Differences in absenteeism between the groups was the primary outcome measure. First, appointments were separated into 2 groups: (1) appointments for which a reminder call was attempted (\"called\" group) and (2) appointments for which a reminder call was not attempted (\"not-called\" group). The appointments were then separated into 2 further groups: (1) the reminder call was successfully achieved (\"contacted\" group) and (2) the patient either was not called or was called but could not be reached (\"not-contacted\" group). Finally, the contacted group was separated into 2 further groups: (1) reminder calls that resulted in direct conversation with an appropriate person at the patient's listed telephone number, and (2) reminder message left on an answering machine.\nContext 3: Absenteeism from outpatient appointments is common. Telephone appointment-reminder calls reduce outpatient-appointment absenteeism in many clinic settings.\nContext 4: Data were collected from 515 consecutive outpatient appointments; 45 (8.7%) of these patients did not show up for testing. The absentee rate was 4.7% (n = 10) in the called group and 11.6% (n = 35) in the not-called group (p = 0.0066). In the called group, 6.5% (n = 14) could not be reached. The absentee rate was 4% (n = 8) in the contacted group and 11.7% (n = 37) in the not-contacted group (p = 0.0021). We found no difference in absenteeism between patients who received reminders via direct conversation (4.2%) and those who had a reminder message left on an answering machine (3.7%) (p > 0.05).\nContext 5: The telephone-based case-management intervention reduced the total number of outpatient visits (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.75-0.84), the number of emergency department visits (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.72-0.88), and the number of hospital admissions (relative risk 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.72-0.88).\nContext 6: Telephone appointment-reminder calls reduce outpatient absenteeism at a hospital-based pulmonary function laboratory.\nContext 7: We conducted a retrospective review of our pulmonary function laboratory's outpatient appointment records from April to November 2004.

Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 43.6%; LVEF was <40% in 36% of subjects. None of the measured echocardiographic parameters (including LVEF) was significantly associated with inpatient mortality (all p>0.1). Subjects with LVEF <40% more often had shockable arrest rhythms and patients resuscitated from shockable rhythms had lower mean LVEF (36.2% vs. 52.3%, p=0.001). There was no correlation between markers of right and left ventricular systolic or diastolic function (including LVEF and Doppler parameters) with vasopressor requirements, lactate levels or SOFA scores.\nContext 4: Ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed and quantified by use of prespecified criteria on baseline ambulatory ECGs from 1080 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction </=35% enrolled in PROMISE. The relationship of ventricular arrhythmias and other clinical parameters to overall mortality and sudden death classified by an independent, blinded mortality committee was determined. There were 290 deaths, of which 139 were classified as sudden. Of the several measures of ventricular ectopy that were univariate predictors, the frequency of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) was the most powerful predictor and remained a significant independent predictor when included with other clinical variables in multivariate models of both sudden death mortality and non-sudden death mortality. However, multiple logistic analysis with models including the clinical variables with and without the NSVT variable demonstrated that the frequency of NSVT did not add significant information beyond the clinical variables.\nContext 5: Electrocardiography (ECG), Holter monitoring, exercise testing, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 CChP were measured.

We investigated whether changes in CC10 expression correlate with regression of bronch", "Question: Is pretreatment with antiplatelet agents independently associated with unfavorable outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage??\nExplanation: The Cerebral Hemorrhage and NXY-059 Treatment trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of NXY-059 after spontaneous ICH. We analyzed patients in the placebo arm, and correlated antiplatelet medication use at the time of ICH with initial ICH volumes, ICH growth in the first 72 hours, and modified Rankin Score at 90 days. Patients on oral anticoagulation were excluded.", "Question: Yes, human adenovirus Ad36 and its E4orf1 gene enhance cellular glucose uptake even in the presence of inflammatory cytokines.\nExplanation: Ad36, a human adenovirus, increases adiposity but improves glycemic control in animal models. Similarly, natural Ad36 infection is cross-sectionally associated with greater adiposity and better glycemic control in humans. This study compared longitudinal observations in indices of adiposity (BMI and body fat percentage) and glycemic control (fasting glucose and insulin) in Ad36-infected versus uninfected adults. This study is to determine if Adenovirus type 36 (Ad36) infection is related to macrophage infiltration in the obese group and non-obese group", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Mortality was greater in the control group than in the treatment group (21 of 30 [70%] vs. 2 of 64 [3%]; p < 0.01). There were no differences in mortality within either the control group (1 day, 6 of 10; 7 days, 7 of 10; 42 days, 8 of 10; p=0.62) or the treatment group (1 day, 0 of 21; 7 days, 0 of 21; 42 days, 2 of 22; p=0.14). Immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M antibody responses were greater in vaccinated than in nonvaccinated rats. There was no effect of timing of vaccination on antibody response.\nContext 2: Defined particles carrying tightly bound allergens at high density have been suggested as alternatives in allergy vaccination. Carbohydrate based particles (CBP), sized 2 microm, provide a platform for covalent coupling of allergens.\nContext 3: Mice (n = 10/group) were subcutaneously vaccinated with CBP-rFel d 1, CBP or phosphate buffer saline (PBS) before sensitization with rFel d 1 and challenged with cat dander extract. Fluorescent and (75)Se-radiolabeled tracking of allergens and particles were performed with flow cytometry and whole-body autoradiography. Humoral, cellular and regulatory immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Cytokines were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and splenocyte cultures.\nContext 4: Mice were vaccinated 28 and 7 days before allergen exposure with a Der f1-encoding plasmid formulated with a block copolymer. Asthma was induced by skin sensitization followed by intra-nasal challenges with Der f extract. Total lung, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and spleen cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for their surface antigen and cytokine expression. Splenocytes and lung cell IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8+ cells in response to Der f CMH1-restricted peptides was assessed by ELISPOT. IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a were measured in serum by ELISA. Specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness was assessed by direct resistance measurements.\nContext 5: Compared to animals vaccinated with an irrelevant plasmid, mice vaccinated with a plasmid encoding Der f 1 were protected against allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. The protective effect was associated with increased IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8+ cells in response to Der f CMH1-restricted peptides.", "definitely yes\nExplanation: Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that is used to treat angina pectoris.

Osteoblasts on coated alloys showed better viability and surface binding than those on uncoated alloys. Sr inclusion in the alloys enhanced their bone-specific gene expression. The in vivo activity of implants with higher Sr and Col-I coating was superior to uncoated and other coated alloys as they showed faster bone induction and higher mineral content in the newly formed bone.\nContext 3: Strontium ranelate reduces fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Evidence from non-clinical studies and analyses of bone markers in phase III trials indicate that this is due to an increase in osteoblast formation and a decrease of osteoclastic resorption. The aim of this work was to investigate, in human cells, the mechanisms by which strontium ranelate is able to influence the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.\nContext 4: MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell line was used to analyse the in vitro properties of Col-I coated and uncoated alloys. Cell viability analysis was performed by MTT assay; cell attachment on alloy surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); and gene profiling of bone-specific markers in cells plated on uncoated alloys was performed by Quantitative RT-PCR. In vivo studies were performed by implanting 2-mm-sized cylindrical pins of uncoated and coated alloys in male New Zealand white rabbits (n\u00a0=\u00a033). Bone formation and mineralisation was studied by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and histological analysis at one and three months post-implantation.\nContext 5: Microscopic examination showed a surface topography of rodlike crystals on both surfaces. XRD and FT-IR showed that the phase of the deposits was HA. No differences were found in surface roughness between the two groups. ICP-AES showed that the Sr/(Ca+Sr) molar ratio of Sr-HA coating was 10.1 mol%. Histologic observation showed that the bone formation was higher on the coated alloys than on the uncoated ones. The mineral content of the newly formed bone was higher on the coated alloys than on the uncoated ones. The bone formation rate was higher on the coated alloys than on the uncoated ones. The bone formation rate was higher on the coated alloys than on the uncoated ones. The bone formation rate was higher on the coated alloys than on the uncoated ones.

Patients with the G-allele (Arg-variant) had higher scores on the HADS depression scales (p=0.007). A gene x glycemic control interaction (p=0.032) was observed on the anxiety scale at the TPH2 promoter polymorphism: the -703T-allele decreased anxiety scores only in the GC group (p=0.008).\nContext 3: Our results suggest an association between genetic variations in the GAL-gene and severity of PD-symptoms in female patients. The most pronounced effects could be observed for two haplotypes containing the closely linked, non-protein-coding SNPs rs948854 and rs4432027. Both polymorphisms are located within CpG-dinucleotides in the promoter region of GAL and thus might be involved in epigenetic regulation of the GAL-gene.\nContext 4: Galanin (GAL) is a neuropeptide, which is expressed primarily in limbic nuclei in the brain and mediates miscellaneous physiological processes and behaviors. In animal studies, both the application of GAL and antagonism of its receptors have been shown to affect anxiety-like and depression-related behavior. In humans, intravenous administration of the neuropeptide galanin has been reported to have fast antidepressant efficacy. Furthermore, GAL is involved in hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic signalling and cosecreted with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), possibly acting as a mediator of estrogen action.\nContext 5: The study included 354 women: 272 patients with POP and 82 controls; 18 (7\u00a0%) cases versus 3 (4\u00a0%) controls had a homozygous rs1800255, COL3A1 2209\u00a0G>A polymorphism (odds ratio 1.9, 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.5-6.9, compared to the wild type), and thus no association between POP and the homozygous polymorphism could be demonstrated. A discrepancy between HRM and PCR-RFLP results was observed in 2 cases. The rs1800255 polymorphism was not associated with POP in the combined analysis of the 2 studies.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs1800255 polymorphism in the COL3A1 gene and the risk of developing postpartum ovarian polycystic ovary syndrome (PP-OPCOS). The rs1800255 polymorphism was genotyped in 100 women with PP-OPCOS and 100 healthy controls. The rs1800255 polymorphism was not associated with PP-OPCOS in the combined analysis of the 2 studies.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the rs", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Because increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatases in the pancreatic islets may contribute to impaired insulin secretion in diabetes, we studied the effects of the phosphatase inhibitor peroxovanadate (pV) in islets of spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and control Wistar rats.\nContext 2: Mice with complete deletion of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) develop hyperglycemia, impaired hepatic insulin signaling, and elevated gluconeogenesis, whereas mice deficient for protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1B display an opposing hepatic phenotype characterized by increased sensitivity to insulin. To define the relationship between these two signaling pathways in the regulation of liver metabolism, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to study the effects of inhibiting PTP1B on hepatic insulin signaling and expression of gluconeogenic enzymes in IRS2(-/-) mice.\nContext 3: Thirty Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were randomly divided into three groups: RYGB operation, sham operation, and food restriction groups. Ten Wistar rats were used as non-diabetic control. The body weight and food consumption of rats were recorded 1 week before or every week after surgery. The fasting blood sugar and oral glucose tolerance test were performed using blood glucose meter. The levels of plasma insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The insulin resistance was quantified using homeostasis model assessment method. The expression of GLP-1 receptor, Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 was determined by Western blotting.\nContext 4: Exogenous insulin inhibits secretin-stimulated pancreatic bicarbonate output via a dose-dependent mechanism; this effect is prevented by pancreatic denervation.\nContext 5: Insulin activates insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase and downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling in muscle to promote glucose uptake. The insulin receptor can serve as a substrate for the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which share a striking 74% sequence identity in their catalytic domains. PTP1B is a validated therapeutic target for the alleviation of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. PTP1B dephosphorylates the insulin receptor, thereby inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity and preventing insulin-mediated glucose uptake. TCPTP is a novel insulin receptor substrate that is expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle. TCPTP is a substrate for PTP1B and is phosphorylated by PTP1B in response to insulin. TCPTP is also a substrate for PTP1B in the heart and skeletal muscle. TCPTP is a substrate for PTP1B in the heart and skeletal muscle. TCPTP is a substrate for PTP1B in the heart and skeletal muscle. TCPTP is a substrate for PTP1B in the heart and skeletal muscle.

No demographic differences between these groups were observed. The mean follow-up for this study was 2 years.\nWe sought to determine if any difference in quality of life measures could be detected in patients", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury after lung transplantation leads to significant morbidity and mortality in recipients, which remains the major obstacle in clinical lung transplantation. To reduce pulmonary graft dysfunction and improve prognosis after lung transplantation, prevention of IR-induced lung injury in the peri-operative period is required. In the present study, we investigated the effects of recombinant hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on pulmonary IR injury using a murine model system.\nContext 2: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important barrier to liver surgery and transplantation because it impairs remnant liver/reduced-size-graft regeneration. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), as an effective measure to overcome I/R injury, has been shown to enhance the regenerative capacity of hepatocytes. However, investigations have always focused on regeneration in the late phase after reperfusion. This study aimed to investigate whether IPC enhances hepatocyte proliferation in the early phase after reperfusion and possible underlying mechanisms.\nContext 3: We used an isolated, buffer-perfused lung system to explore the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by resident lung cells in pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury. Lungs from wild-type mice and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-deficient mice were subjected to 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Histologic injury scores and measurements of lung compliance, airway resistance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, vascular reactivity, and wet lung weight index were obtained and compared using repeated-measures analysis of variance.\nContext 4: A central role of macrophages in initiating lung ischemia-reperfusion injury is emerging. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted mainly by macrophages under various conditions. We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor-alpha from resident lung cells is a key initiating factor in pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nContext 5: Biochemical assays showed that scFv/TM accelerated protein C activation by thrombin and bound mouse PECAM-1 and cytokine high mobility group-B1. After intravenous injection, scFv/TM preferentially accumulated in the mouse pulmonary vasculature. In a lung model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, scFv/TM attenuated elevation of early growth response-1, inhibited pulmonary deposition of fibrin and leukocyte infiltration, and preserved blood oxygenation more effectively than soluble TM. In an ALI model, scFv/TM reduced pulmonary edema and improved lung function more effectively than soluble TM. In a lung ischemia-reperfusion injury model, scFv/TM reduced pulmonary edema and improved lung function more effectively than soluble TM. In a lung ischemia-reperfusion injury model, scFv/TM reduced pulmonary edema and improved lung function more effectively than soluble TM. In a lung ischemia-reperfusion injury model, scFv/TM reduced pulmonary edema and improved lung function more effectively than soluble TM. In a lung ischemia-reperfusion injury model, scFv/TM reduced pulmonary edema and improved lung function more effectively than soluble TM. In a lung ischemia-reperfusion injury model, scF", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Plant sterol (PS) consumption lowers serum cholesterol levels, while modestly increasing plasma PS concentrations. Plasma PS concentrations may reflect sterol absorption, thus individuals with high plasma plant sterol (HPS) concentrations may show greater changes in circulating cholesterol and PS than individuals with low plasma plant sterol (LPS) concentrations. The objective of this study was to examine whether HPS and LPS concentrations are related to subsequent changes in plasma PS, serum lipid and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, following dietary PS intake in otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic men.\nContext 2: Despite significant (P = 0.004) increases of, respectively, 42 and 59% in cholesterol-standardized serum sitosterol and campesterol concentrations in the plant sterol group as compared to the control group, campesterol levels in the red blood cells did not change (P = 0.196). Osmotic fragility did not change significantly (P = 0.757) in the plant sterol and plant stanol groups as compared to the control group.\nContext 3: Forty-one subjects on stable statin treatment - who already have increased serum plant sterol and stanol concentrations - first received for 4 weeks a control margarine. For the next 16 weeks, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three possible interventions. Eleven subjects continued with control margarine, 15 subjects with plant sterol ester enriched and 15 subjects with plant stanol ester-enriched margarine. Daily plant sterol or stanol intake was 2.5 g. Erythrocyte haemolysis was measured spectrophotometrically at five different saline concentrations.\nContext 4: Phytosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by dramatically elevated circulating levels of plant sterols (PS). Phytosterolemia is believed to be responsible for severe premature atherosclerosis. The clinical, biological and molecular genetic features of 5 patients with phytosterolemia and transient severe hypercholesterolemia challenge this hypothesis.\nContext 5: The importance of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) size and the apolipoprotein E (Apo E) in the atherogenic process is known, but there is little information with regard to the effect of phytosterols (PS) on these parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of PS on lipid profile and Apo E in a group of hypercholesterolemic patients.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of plant sterols (PS) on the lipid profile and on the Apo E in a group of hypercholesterolemic patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of plant sterols (PS) on the lipid profile and on the Apo E in a group of hypercholesterolemic patients.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of plant sterols (PS) on the lipid profile and on the Apo E in a group of hypercholesterolemic patients.\nContext 9: The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Sodium intake is high in people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

The intervention group was educated in a single session to use the nutrition information panel on food labels to choose products which complied with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) guideline of <120 mg sodium/100 g food. The control group continued on their usual diet. The primary outcome measure was 24h urinary sodium excretion which was performed at baseline and 3 months. Data was analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance, independent samples t-test and Pearson's correlations.\nContext 3: Although evidence shows that reduced sodium intake lowers blood pressure, some studies suggest that sodium reduction may adversely affect insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.\nContext 4: Participants were 10-79 y old, either primarily healthy or with hypertension. In meta-analyses of 20 randomized, crossover trials (n = 504 participants) and 9 nonrandomized crossover trials (n = 337), circulating glucose concentrations of fasting participants were not affected by reduction in sodium intake. In contrast, in meta-analyses of 19 of the 20 randomized, crossover trials (n = 494), fasting insulin concentrations were 9.53 pmol/L higher (95% CI: 5.04, 14.02 pmol/L higher) with sodium reduction. In 9 nonrandomized trials (n = 337), fasting insulin did not differ with reduced sodium intake. Results differed little when the analyses were restricted to studies with a low risk of bias and duration of \u22657 d.\nContext 5: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science through August 2014. Both randomized and nonrandomized intervention trials were included in our meta-analyses. The effects of sodium reduction on glucose tolerance were evaluated in 37 articles, but because of a lack of comparable data, 8 trials were excluded from the meta-analyses.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n\nThe study was a randomized controlled trial.

Additionally, \u03b2-elemene pretreatment prior to IR increased radiation-induced cell death compared with IR alone in MKN45 (10.4% \u00b1 0.9% vs 34.8% \u00b1 2.8%, P < 0.05) and SGC7901 (11.6% \u00b1 0.9% vs 46.7% \u00b1 5.2%, P < 0.05) human gastric cancer cell lines, respectively, consistent with the level of cleaved caspase-3 (17 kDa). Through iTRAQ analysis and western blot validation, we found that \u03b2-elemene upregulated PAK1IP1 and downregulated phospho-Pak1 (T423) and phospho-ERK1/2 in SGC7901 gastric cancer cells. IR increased the level of phospho-Pak1 (T423). Pretreatment with \u03b2-elemene decreased radiation-induced Pak1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Pak1 using IPA-3 decreased clonogenic survival following IR. In addition, IPA-3 increased radiation-induced cell death in MKN45 (13.4% \u00b1 0.3% vs 26.6% \u00b1 1.0%, P < 0.05) and SGC7901 (16.0% \u00b1 0.6% vs 37.3% \u00b1 1.7%, P < 0.05) gastric cancer cell lines, respectively, consistent with the level of cleaved caspase-3 (17 kDa). Western blotting showed that IPA-3 decreased radiation-induced Pak1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.\nContext 3: SGC7901, MKN45, MKN28, N87, and AGS human gastric cancer cell lines were used to screen for radioresistant gastric cancer cell lines. A 3-(4,5-dimeth-ylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to determine the effects of \u03b2-elemene on cell viability. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry.

However, its mechanisms are not fully understood. In lupus, a compromised blood-brain barrier may allow for the passage of circulating autoantibodies into the brain, where they can induce neuropsychiatric abnormalities including depression-like behavior and cognitive abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of B cells and/or autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of murine NPSLE.\nContext 2: We evaluated neuropsychiatric manifestations, brain pathology, and cytokine expression in constitutively (JhD/MRL/lpr) and conditionally (hCD20-DTA/MRL/lpr, inducible by tamoxifen) B cell-depleted mice as compared to MRL/lpr lupus mice.\nContext 3: To define whether anti-ribosomal P (anti-P) autoantibodies from patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) impair the function of hippocampal neurons that express the neuronal surface P antigen (NSPA) when accessing the brain via circulating blood.\nContext 4: There is an increasing appreciation of the deleterious effects of antibody and B cells on acute and chronic transplant outcomes. Many effector functions of antibody are mediated by a family of receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) that are expressed on most immune cells, including neutrophils, natural killer cells, and B cells. Most Fc\u03b3Rs are activating and controlled by a single inhibitory receptor, Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B), which also regulates some aspects of B-cell activation and antibody production. Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice develop severe chronic arteriopathy in a murine cardiac allograft model. A single nucleotide polymorphism in human Fc\u03b3RIIB (rs1050501) results in profound receptor dysfunction and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The frequency of this Fc\u03b3RIIB-I/T232 polymorphism also shows significant racial variation.\nContext 5: Serum IgG antibodies (Abs) to phosphorylated ribosomal (P ribosomal) proteins have been inconsistently associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Similarly, natural Ad36 infection is cross-sectionally associated with greater adiposity and better glycemic control in humans. This study compared longitudinal observations in indices of adiposity (BMI and body fat percentage) and glycemic control (fasting glucose and insulin) in Ad36-infected versus uninfected adults.\nContext 3: The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) was identified as a common cellular receptor for both viruses, but its biological and pathogenic relevance is uncertain. Knowledge of CAR localization in the human cardiovascular system is limited but important with respect to CAR-dependent viral infections and gene transfer using CAR-dependent viral vectors.\nContext 4: In the obese individuals infected with Ad36, the expression levels of adiponectin and visfatin in serum was elevated. For the individuals infected with Ad36, the macrophage infiltration (as indicated by CD68 level) in the obese group was also significantly higher than that in the non-obese group (P\u2009<\u20090.05) in both abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues. The real-time PCR results indicated that APMI mRNA levels and Visfatin mRNA levels in Ad36 infected cells were significantly increased.\nContext 5: The human apoA-I gene has been transferred into different mouse models by use of a recombinant adenovirus under the control of an RSV-LTR promoter (AV RSV apoA-I). Administration of AV RSV apoA-I to C57BL/6 mice resulted in moderate expression of human apoA-I for 3 weeks, leading to a transient elevation (40% at day 11 after injection) of HDL cholesterol concentration. In contrast, administration of AV RSV apoA-I to human apoA-I-transgenic mice induced a large increase of human apoA-I and HDL cholesterol concentrations (300% and 360%, respectively, at day 14 after injection) for 10 weeks, indicating that an immune response to the transgene was one major hurdle for long-term duration of expression. Recombinant adenovirus expressing human apolipoprotein A-I (AV RSV apoA-I) was also used to transfer human apoA-I into the liver of ApoE-/- mice. The results showed that AV RSV apoA-I was able to transfer human apoA-I into the liver of ApoE-/- mice, leading to a significant increase of human apoA-I and HDL cholesterol concentrations in the liver of ApoE-/- mice.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ad36 on the expression of adiponectin and visfatin in the adipose tissue of obese and non-obese individuals.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ad36 on the expression of adiponectin and visfatin in the adipose tissue of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Regulation of meiosis and sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model for a highly regulated developmental process. Meiosis middle phase transcriptional regulation is governed by two transcription factors: the activator Ndt80 and the repressor Sum1. It has been suggested that the competition between Ndt80 and Sum1 determines the temporal expression of their targets during middle meiosis.\nContext 2: Many genes are meiosis and/or sporulation-specifically transcribed during this process. Isolation and analysis of these genes might help us to understand how meiosis and sporulation are regulated. For this purpose, we have isolated a large number of cDNA clones from Schizosaccharomyces pombe whose expression is up-regulated during meiosis.\nContext 3: Using a combination of ChIP-on-chip and expression profiling, we characterized a middle phase transcriptional network and studied the relationship between Ndt80 and Sum1 during middle and late meiosis. While finding a group of genes regulated by both factors in a feed forward loop regulatory motif, our data also revealed a large group of genes regulated solely by Ndt80. Measuring the expression of all Ndt80 target genes in various genetic backgrounds (WT, sum1Delta and MK-ER-Ndt80 strains), allowed us to dissect the exact transcriptional network regulating each gene, which was frequently different than the one inferred from the binding data alone.\nContext 4: Here, we show a general association between the degree to which yeast cells have evolved mechanisms to buffer changes in gene expression and whether they possess protein-protein interactions. We argue that this effect bears an affinity to epistasis, because yeast appears to have evolved regulatory mechanisms such that distant changes in gene copy number for a protein-protein interaction partner gene can alter a gene's expression. This association is not unexpected given recent work linking epistasis and the deleterious effects of changes in gene dosage (i.e., the dosage balance hypothesis). Using gene expression data from artificial aneuploid strains of bakers' yeast, we found that genes coding for proteins that physically interact with other proteins show less expression variation in response to aneuploidy than do other genes. This effect is even more pronounced for genes whose products interact with proteins encoded on aneuploid chromosomes. We further found that genes targeted by transcription factors encoded on aneuploid chromosomes were more likely to change in expression after aneuploidy.\nContext 5: Fission yeast has a unique mechanism for regulating gene expression during meiosis. The transcription factor Ndt80 binds to the promoter of a subset of genes and represses their expression. The repressor Sum1 binds to the promoter of a subset of genes and activates their expression. The two factors compete for binding to the promoter, and the competition determines the temporal expression of their targets. We have developed a method to measure the binding of Ndt80 and Sum1 to the promoters of genes in vivo. We have used this method to show that Ndt80 and Sum1 bind to the promoters of a subset of genes in a feed forward loop regulatory motif. We have also used this method to show that Ndt80 and Sum1 bind to the promoters of", "Question: Does comprehensive staging allow for excellent outcome in patients with localized malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary??\nExplanation: The management of malignant germ cell tumors of the ovary (OMGCT) requires multidisciplinary expertise.

HIV-negative partners were tested quarterly. This analysis is restricted to couples in which the man was HIV-positive and the woman was HIV-negative at enrollment and the man was not on antiretroviral treatment. Multivariate Cox models evaluated associations between time-varying contraceptive methods and HIV acquisition among women. Sensitivity analyses explored exposure misclassification and time-varying confounder mediation.\nContext 3: For women at risk of HIV-1, effective contraception and effective HIV-1 prevention are global priorities.\nContext 4: In a clinical trial of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-1 prevention in HIV-1-serodiscordant couples, we estimated the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (oral contraceptive pills, injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, and hormonal implants) for pregnancy prevention relative to no contraception among 1785 HIV-1-uninfected women followed up to 36 months. We compared the effectiveness of each method among women assigned PrEP versus placebo. Contraception was not required for participation, but was offered on-site and was recorded monthly; incident pregnancy was determined by monthly urine testing.\nContext 5: Among 1393 couples, 252 incident infections occurred in women over 2842 couple-years (8.9 infections per 100 couple-years; 95% CI, 7.8-10.0). Multivariate Cox models indicated that neither injectable [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7], oral contraceptive pill (OCP, aHR=1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.8), or implant (aHR=1.1; 95% CI, 0.5-2.2) use was significantly associated with HIV acquisition relative to non-hormonal contraception controlling for woman's age, literacy and time-varying measures of genital ulceration/inflammation. This remained true when only looking at the subset of infections acquired from the spouse (82% of infections) and additionally controlling for baseline HIV viral load of the male partner, pregnancy status, and condom use.\nContext 6: The use of hormonal contraceptives among HIV-negative women cohabiting with HIV-positive male partners is associated with a lower risk of HIV acquisition.\nContext 7: The use of hormonal contraceptives among HIV-negative women cohabiting with HIV-positive male partners is associated with a lower risk of HIV acquisition.\nContext 8: The use of hormonal contraceptives among HIV-negative women cohabiting with HIV-positive male partners is associated with a lower risk of HIV acquisition.\nContext 9: The use of hormonal contraceptives among HIV-negative women cohabiting with HIV-positive male partners is associated with a lower risk of HIV acquisition.\nContext 10: The use of hormonal contraceptives among HIV", "Contexts:\nContext 1: All consecutive patients requiring tracheal intubation were prospectively analysed before (first period) and after the training programme focusing on anaesthetic protocols for tracheal intubation (second period). The number of attempts at laryngoscopy, the time taken to achieve tracheal intubation, the difficulties encountered and the related complications of the anaesthetic technique were recorded. At the end of the first period, the results were reported to the whole staff of the unit and the anaesthesia protocols were then modified by introducing succinylcholine into the induction sequence, as part of a training programme.\nContext 2: To examine the association between the performance of a tracheostomy and intensive care unit and postintensive care unit mortality, controlling for treatment selection bias and confounding variables.\nContext 3: Approval by the local ethical committee and informed written consent was obtained. After preoxygenation (3 min) and induction of anesthesia with fentanyl (1-2 micrograms.kg-1 b.w.) and thiopental (5 mg.kg-1 b.w) patients were divided into two groups: group 1 patients (without PPMV, n = 333) received succinylcholine 30s after thiopental followed by tracheal intubation. Group 2 patients (with PPMV, n = 336) were ventilated by mask for at least 30s after thiopental injection, followed by succinylcholine and, after another 120s of PPMV, tracheal intubation. All anesthetics were performed by 15 anesthesiologists (8 certified staff members, 7 residents).\nContext 4: The study aimed to evaluate and improve airway management in the prehospital setting, i.e. physicians working on board ambulances. A quality control programme focusing on anaesthesia was instituted to improve the time taken to perform endotracheal intubation.\nContext 5: Tracheal intubation was successful in 186 of 200 patients (93.0%): 169 (84.5%) at the first attempt. Fourteen (7.0%) had to be intubated using direct laryngoscope. Both the first attempt success rate and overall success rate were similar between the MP12 and MP34 groups (84.0 vs. 85.0%, P=0.845 and 93.0 vs. 93.0%, P=0.999, respectively). The overall success rate was significantly higher in the MP12 group (P=0.001). The overall success rate was significantly higher in the MP12 group (P=0.001). The overall success rate was significantly higher in the MP12 group (P=0.001). The overall success rate was significantly higher in the MP12 group (P=0.001).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to predict the need of coronary revascularization in symptomatic patients with stable angina who were referred to a cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary revascularization.\nA total of 2,928 consecutive patients with stable angina who were enrolled in the prospective Euro Heart Survey on Coronary Revascularization were studied. Multivariable analyses were applied to evaluate the relation between diabetes, treatment decision, and 1-year outcome", "#1: No, interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are not associated with risk of vascular calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.\n#2: No, interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are not associated with risk of vascular calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.\n#3: No, interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are not associated with risk of vascular calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.\n#4: No, interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are not associated with risk of vascular calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.\n#5: No, interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are not associated with risk of vascular", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Ethanol and neuropeptide Y (NPY) can have additive neurobehavioral effects. In the present study, the NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 was administered alone or in combination with a moderate dose of ethanol to determine whether it interacted with the neurobehavioral effects of ethanol.\nContext 2: The behavioral effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) attributed to its actions in the hypothalamus are complex and include effects on feeding, sedation, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. NPY infused into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) increases ethanol intake in unselected rats. High-alcohol-drinking (HAD1) and low-alcohol-drinking (LAD1) rats differ in basal NPY levels in the PVN, and HAD1, but not LAD1, rats exhibit decreases in ethanol intake after infusion of NPY into the ventricles. This study examined whether NPY infused into the PVN alters ethanol intake in HAD1 and LAD1 rats.\nContext 3: The central extended amygdala (cEA) which includes the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the lateral posterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTLP), has been proposed to play a key role in excessive ethanol consumption in humans (Koob and Le Moal, 2005 Nat Neurosci 8:1442). To examine this relationship, we used a murine model of ethanol dependence (Becker and Lopez, 2004 Alcohol Clin Exp Res 28:1829; Lopez and Becker, 2005 Psychopharmacology (Berl) 181:688) and compared animals with sham lesions and electrolytic lesions of the CeA and BNSTLP.\nContext 4: It has been demonstrated that ethanol decreases blood luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in rodents. This effect seems to be produced by the capacity of ethanol to release beta-endorphins from the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and, in a second step, by a mu-receptor-mediated inhibitory effect of these peptides on hypothalamic LH-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. However, it has been reported that, in primary hypothalamic cultures, the ethanol-produced beta-endorphin release is mediated by the enzyme catalase. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether catalase inhibition modifies ethanol effects on blood LH levels.\nContext 5: The present study examined the effects of ethanol on the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the rat brain. The c-fos gene encodes a protein that is rapidly induced in response to a variety of stimuli, including stress, injury, and drugs of abuse. The c-fos protein is a marker of neuronal activation and is thought to be involved in the regulation of neuronal plasticity. The present study examined the effects of ethanol on the expression of c-fos in the rat brain.\nContext 6: The present study examined the effects of ethanol on the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the rat brain. The c-fos gene encodes a protein that is rapidly induced in response", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Iron deposits are characteristic of endometriotic lesions, and pelvic iron concentrations are higher in endometriosis patients than in women without endometriosis. In this study, the effect of iron overload and iron chelation on the development of endometriosis in a murine model was investigated.\nContext 2: Human menstrual endometrium was injected i.p. into nude mice, either alone (controls) or supplemented with erythrocytes or desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator. After 5 days, the iron load of endometriosis-like lesions and peritoneal macrophages and fluid was evaluated. Lesions were quantified by immunohistochemical morphometry, and their proliferative activity was assessed.\nContext 3: Injection of erythrocytes into the pelvic cavity caused iron overload in lesions (P < 0.025) and peritoneal macrophages (P < 0.01) and fluid (P < 0.05), whereas DFO effectively reduced iron status in lesions (P < 0.05) and macrophages (P < 0.01) compared with controls. No difference was observed in the number or surface area of lesions between the three groups. Erythrocytes increased (P < 0.05) and DFO significantly decreased (P < 0.01) the proliferative activity of lesions.\nContext 4: Women with endometriosis have elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in peritoneal macrophages and endometriotic tissue. Inhibition of COX-2 has been shown to reduce inflammation, angiogenesis and cellular proliferation. It may also downregulate aromatase activity in ectopic endometrial lesions. Ectopic endometrial establishment and growth are therefore likely to be suppressed in the presence of COX-2 inhibitors. We hypothesized that COX-2 inhibition would reduce the size and number of ectopic human endometrial lesions in a nude mouse model of endometriosis.\nContext 5: T. vaginalis cultured in iron-rich and -deficient conditions were collected for all experiments in this study. Next generation RNA sequencing was conducted to investigate the impact of iron on transcriptome of T. vaginalis. The cell viabilities were monitored after the trophozoites treated with the inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (L-NAME) and iron (DFO) for 24 h. The expression of genes related to iron metabolism and NO synthesis were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of iron on the growth of T. vaginalis. The trophozoites were cultured in iron-rich and -deficient conditions. The cell viabilities were monitored after the trophozoites treated with the inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (L-NAME) and iron (DFO) for 24 h. The expression of genes related to iron metabolism and NO synthesis were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).\nContext 7: The aim of", "Question: Is dietary hyperoxaluria reduced by treatment with lactic acid bacteria??\nExplanation: The study was designed to determine whether treatment with Lactobacillus acidophilus L-1 (Lactobacillus acidophilus L-1) reduces urinary oxalate excretion in patients with secondary hyperoxaluria. The study was conducted in 20 healthy subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either Lactobacillus acidophilus L-1 or a placebo for 6\u00a0weeks. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, subjects were placed on a diet normal in oxalate for 2\u00a0weeks.

One hundred consecutive patients of whom 80 (80%) had benign ovarian cyst, 4 (4%) had borderline lesion and 16 (16%) had invasive ovarian cancer were included in the study. Forty-five percent (9/20) of malignant cases were epithelial ovarian cancer, 20% (4/20) were borderline ovarian tumor, 30% (6/20) were non-epithelial ovarian cancers and 5% (1/20) was a metastasis from", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene, is a hereditary tumor syndrome manifested by hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. In addition, a multitude of other rare tumors, including parasympathetic paragangliomas, can occur and even be the sole manifestation of VHL disease. The VHL gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene with biallelic inactivation contributing to tumor formation. However, in parasympathetic paragangliomas occurring in VHL disease, biallelic inactivation of the VHL gene has not been demonstrated to date.\nContext 2: Pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome is caused by mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, encoding subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and in SDHAF2, required for flavination of SDHA. A recent report described a patient with an abdominal paraganglioma, immunohistochemically negative for SDHA, and identified a causal germline mutation in SDHA.\nContext 3: The head and neck paragangliomas of two VHL patients were analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of the VHL gene. In addition loss of heterozygosity analysis was performed for three microsatellite loci near the VHL gene. To rule out other underlying genetic causes of the parasympathetic paragangliomas, mutation analysis of the SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes was also performed.\nContext 4: Apart from germline VHL mutations, no additional mutations were found in the paraganglioma-related tumor suppressor genes SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Analysis of paraganglioma tissue revealed loss of the VHL wild-type allele in both tumors, indicating that in these tumors biallelic VHL gene inactivation occurred.\nContext 5: We investigated 316 pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas for SDHA expression. Sequence analysis of SDHA was performed on all tumors that were immunohistochemically negative for SDHA and on a subset of tumors immunohistochemically positive for SDHA.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that supports your answer.\nYes: The patient with the parasympathetic paraganglioma had a germline mutation in SDHA. The patient with the VHL disease had a germline mutation in the VHL gene. The patient with the VHL disease had a germline mutation in the VHL gene and a germline mutation in SDHA. The patient with the VHL disease had a germline mutation in the VHL gene and a germline mutation in SDHA and a germline mutation in SDHB. The patient with the VHL disease had a germline mutation in the VHL gene and a germline mutation in SDHB and a germline mutation in SDHC", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Two endophenotypes of arterial calcification, calcification on arterial wall and calcification in atherosclerotic plaques, are associated with different types of cardiovascular events. Mgp-deficient mice showed matrix Gla protein (MGP) is strongly associated with calcification on arterial wall without atherosclerotic plaques, and MGP variants were not significantly associated with myocardial infarction. MGP may play different roles in the 2 endophenotypes.\nContext 2: We analyzed the associations of MGP variants rs4236, rs1800801, and rs1800802 with the 2 endophenotypes determined by multidetector computed tomography angiography. A total of 585 with calcification on coronary artery wall, 675 with calcification in coronary atherosclerotic plaques, 454 with calcification on aortic wall, and 725 controls were enrolled. After Bonferroni correction, rs4236 and rs1800801 were still associated with calcification on arterial wall, the odds ratios were 0.708 (95% confidence interval, 0.540-0.928) for rs4236 and 0.652 (95% confidence interval, 0.479-0.888) for rs1800801 in coronary artery wall calcification, and 0.699 (95% confidence interval, 0.525-0.931) for rs4236 and 0.650 (95% confidence interval, 0.467-0.905) for rs1800801 in aortic wall calcification, respectively. The variants were correlated with calcification severity by ln(CAC Agatston score+1) in coronary artery wall calcification but not in atherosclerotic plaque calcification. In accordance with their associations with calcification on arterial wall, rs4236C and rs1800801A were associated with higher MGP plasma levels, whereas rs1800802C was associated with lower MGP levels in normal controls. Because of the role of calcification in plaque vulnerability, their associations with acute myocardial infarction were also determined in 771 controls and 752 patients, no association was found.\nContext 3: To investigate whether COMP affects atherosclerotic calcification.\nContext 4: Intimal calcification is highly correlated with atherosclerotic plaque burden, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We recently reported that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is highly expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques and that COMP is a potent inhibitor of calcification in vitro. Here, we investigated the role of COMP in atherosclerotic calcification in vivo.\nContext 5: We examined the association of the COMP gene polymorphisms with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in a Chinese Han population.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the COMP gene polymorphisms with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in a Chinese Han population.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the COMP gene polymorphisms with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in a Chinese Han population.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Since beta-blocker therapy is known to be effective in patients with an injured heart, such as infarction, we designed the present study to examine the protective effects of infusion of the beta1-selective blocker esmolol on myocardial function in peritonitis-induced septic rats using an isolated working heart preparation.\nContext 2: Recent American Heart Association guidelines highlight the paucity of data on effectiveness and/or mechanisms underlying use of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) antagonists after acute coronary syndromes in patients subsequently undergoing revascularization. It is important to assess whether beta AR antagonists might protect the heart and improve ventricular function in this scenario. The authors therefore used esmolol (an ultra-short-acting beta AR antagonist) to determine whether beta AR antagonist treatment improves left ventricular function in a canine model of acute reversible coronary ischemia followed by coronary reperfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The authors also tested whether the mechanism includes preserved beta AR signaling.\nContext 3: Ventricular-arterial (V-A) decoupling decreases myocardial efficiency and is exacerbated by tachycardia that increases static arterial elastance (Ea). We thus investigated the effects of heart rate (HR) reduction on Ea in septic shock patients using the beta-blocker esmolol. We hypothesized that esmolol improves Ea by positively affecting the tone of arterial vessels and their responsiveness to HR-related changes in stroke volume (SV).\nContext 4: Esmolol infusion did not cause an elevation of arterial lactate levels but reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations vs. the control group (p <.05). Both cardiac output and cardiac efficiency in the esmolol-treated rats were significantly higher throughout the study periods vs. the control group (p <.05).\nContext 5: Esmolol reduced HR in all patients and this was associated with a decrease in Ea (2.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 vs. 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.52\u00a0mmHg\u00a0l(-1)), arterial dP/dt max (1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 vs. 0.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u00a0mmHg\u00a0ms(-1)), and a parallel increase in SV (48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 vs. 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0ml), all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Cardiac output and ejection fraction remained unchanged, whereas cardiac efficiency increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Esmolol also reduced the arterial lactate levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nContext 6: Esmolol infusion did not cause an elevation of arterial lactate levels but reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations vs. the control group (p <.05). Both cardiac output and cardiac efficiency in the esmolol-treated rats were significantly higher throughout the study periods vs. the control group (p <.05).\nContext 7: Esmolol reduced HR in all patients and this was associated with a decrease in Ea (2.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 vs. 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.52\u00a0mmHg", "Yes, mTHFR and ACE polymorphisms increase the risk of migraine.\nExplanation: The prevalence of migraine is 15-20% in the general population. The genetic basis of migraine is complex and involves multiple genes and environmental factors. The most common genetic risk factor for migraine is the functional polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, which is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of migraine. The MTHFR gene encodes the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the conversion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to", "Question: Is abnormal p53 immunohistochemistry associated with an increased colorectal cancer-related mortality in patients with ulcerative colitis??\nExplanation: The aim of this study was to determine whether abnormal p53 staining of the tumor correlated with cancer-related mortality in ulcerative colitis patients.\nContext 1: Immunohistochemical evaluation of p53 staining patterns has been considered as a complementary test for dysplasia in ulcerative colitis-related colorectal cancer surveillance, but usefulness would be particularly important if it were a marker associated with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether abnormal p53 staining of the tumor correlated with cancer-related mortality in ulcerative colitis patients.\nContext 2: An historical cohort study was designed", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Antisense transcription, yielding both coding and non-coding RNA, is a widespread phenomenon in mammals. The mechanism by which natural antisense transcripts (NAT) may regulate gene expression are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanism of reciprocal sense-antisense (S-AS) regulation by studying the effects of a coding and non-coding NAT on corresponding gene expression, and to investigate the possible involvement of endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) in S-AS interactions.\nContext 2: Four short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences (siRNA-61, siRNA-70, siRNA-165 and siRNA-296) against a region of GTPV ORF095 were selected. Sense and antisense siRNA-encoding sequences separated by a hairpin loop sequence were designed as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes under the control of a human U6 promoter. ORF095 amplicon was generated using PCR, and then cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector, named as p095/EGFP. p095/EGFP and each of the siRNA expression cassettes (p61, p70, p165 and p296) were co-transfected into BHK-21 cells. Fluorescence detection, flow cytometric analysis, retro transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real time PCR were used to check the efficiency of RNAi. The results showed that the ORF095-specific siRNA-70 effectively down-regulated the expression of ORF095. When Vero cells were transfected with shRNA expression vectors (p61/GFP, p70/GFP, p165/GFP and p296/GFP) and then infected with GTPV, GTPV-ORF095-70 was found to be the most effective inhibition site in decreasing cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by GTPV. The results presented here indicated that DNA-based siRNA could effectively inhibit the replication of GTPV (approximately 463. 5-fold reduction of viral titers) on Vero cells.\nContext 3: RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the phenomenon of sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA induced by double-stranded RNA. It has been successfully utilized to down-regulate endogenous gene expression or suppress the replication of various pathogens in mammalian cells. In this study, the effect of vector-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted by pEGFP-N1 vector on the replication of GTPV was investigated. The results showed that the replication of GTPV was significantly inhibited by pEGFP-N1 vector-based siRNA. The results presented here indicated that DNA-based siRNA could effectively inhibit the replication of GTPV (approximately 463. 5-fold reduction of viral titers) on Vero cells.\nContext 4: The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanism of reciprocal sense-antisense (S-AS) regulation by studying the effects of a coding and non-coding NAT on corresponding gene expression, and to investigate the possible involvement of endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) in S-AS interactions. Four short interfering RNA (siRNA)", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Lung cancer is the second most common neoplasm and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In cancer, weight loss and obesity are associated with reduced survival. However, the effect of obesity or weight loss at presentation on lung cancer survival has not been well studied.\nContext 2: Using an extensive cancer dataset, we identified 76,086 patients diagnosed with lung cancer during the period of 1998-2002, of which 14,751 patients presented with obesity and/or weight loss. We examined the relationship between survival and weight loss or obesity at diagnosis using univariate and multivariate analysis.\nContext 3: Median survival time (MST) for all lung cancer patients was 8.7 mo. Patients presenting with weight loss (15.8%) had shorter MST versus those who did not (6.4 versus 9.2 mo, P < 0.001) and patients with weight loss had significantly shortened MST for all stages and histologic subtypes. In contrast, obese patients at presentation (5.4%) had longer MST relative to non-obese patients (13.0 versus 8.6 mo, P < 0.001), which was significant across all stages and histologic subtypes. Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence of weight loss was an independent, positive predictor of improved survival (HR = 0.087, P < 0.001), while the absence of obesity was an independent predictor of worsened survival in lung cancer (HR = 1.16, P < 0.001).\nContext 4: Underweight, normal weight, pre-obesity, and obesity were diagnosed in 14 (1.0%), 444 (33.2%), 593 (44.3%), and 287 (21.4%) RCC patients, respectively. A lower BMI was significantly associated with higher age, tumor grade, and the rate of metastasis at diagnosis. Overweight patients had a significantly lower risk of cancer-related death; their median 5-year tumor-specific survival rate was 70.9% (pre-obese), 74.0% (obese grad I), and 85.6% (obese grad \u2265II) as opposed to 63.8% for patients with a BMI below 25 (p < 0.001). Interestingly, subgroup analysis revealed that the positive association between overweight and survival was found in organ-confined RCC only.\nContext 5: To investigate the prognostic value of body mass index (BMI) in patients with RCC, we analyzed the data of 1,000 patients with RCC who were treated at our institution between 2000 and 2005. The median follow-up time was 36 months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 70.9% for patients with a BMI below 25, 74.0% for patients with a BMI between 25 and 30, and 85.6% for patients with a BMI above 30. The 5-year OS rate was 63.8% for patients with a BMI below 25, 71.1% for patients with a BMI between 25 and 30, and 79.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Physalin F was observed to significantly induce cytotoxicity of three human renal carcinoma A498, ACHN, and UO-31 cells in a concentration-dependent manner; this was especially potent in A498 cells. The physalin F-induced cell apoptosis of A498 cells was characterized by MTT assay, nuclear DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Using flow cytometry analysis, physalin F induced A498 cell apoptosis as demonstrated by the accumulation of the sub-G1 phase in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, physalin F-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL degradation, which led to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. These effects were associated with induction of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, which led to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. However, the antioxidant N-acetyl-(L)-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) resulted in the inhibition of these events and reversed physalin F-induced cell apoptosis. In addition, physalin F suppressed NF-\u03baB activity and nuclear translocation of p65 and p50, which was reversed by NAC and GSH.\nContext 2: The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms of physalin F, an effective purified extract of Physalis angulata L. (Solanacae), in renal carcinoma A498 cells.\nContext 3: Contribution of the Fas system to apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was investigated in vivo.\nContext 4: Combined treatment showed a good synergistic antitumour effect yet spared non-tumourigenic cells. The potential molecular mechanism may be mainly that it activated mitochondrial death pathway and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in the cancer cells. Accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent activation of Akt may also be involved in apoptosis induction.\nContext 5: Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is one of the major cellular serine-threonine phosphatases. It positively regulates apoptosis and negatively regulates the mitogenic pathway, suggesting that loss of it might be involved in cancer development. Recent studies found its association with breast, lung and colorectal cancer; however, its expression profile and its prognostic value in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of PP2A in ccRCC and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of PP2A in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of PP2A in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of PP2A in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Ten of the 46 biopsy specimens (22%) contained TUNEL-positive myocytes; their mean apoptotic index was 0.44 +/- 1.05%. The apoptotic index showed no relation to cardiac functional parameters determined at the time of biopsy, however. Seven patients died during the follow-up period, and 19 of the surviving patients were readmitted to the hospital because of a worsening of their heart failure. There was no significant difference in the apoptotic indexes of biopsy specimens from the dead and surviving patients, or between the surviving patients who were readmitted to the hospital and those who were not. There was also no significant correlation between the apoptotic index and changes in the LV ejection fraction, LV end-diastolic diameter, or LV posterior wall thickness during follow-up.\nContext 2: DNA breaks detected largely by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end-labeling (TUNEL) are observed in the hearts of patients with diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).\nContext 3: DCM patients were selected from among patients who had undergone left ventricular (LV) biopsy during the period from 1994 to 2001 in our hospital. Of those, 46 (35 men and 11 women; mean [+/- SD] age, 58 +/- 11 years) who were followed up for > 3 years after the undergoing the biopsy (mean follow-up period, 4.9 +/- 2.0 years) or died during the follow-up period were entered into the present study. The myocardial apoptotic index was assessed in deparaffinized biopsy specimens that were stained using a conventional TUNEL assay. In addition, all surviving patients received a follow-up echocardiographic examination.\nContext 4: Cats were recruited for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening using echocardiography and genotyping. Circulating markers of collagen turnover (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CITP; type I collagen degradation] and N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen [type III collagen synthesis]) and cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac troponin I) were measured. Correlation between concentrations of collagen biomarkers and echocardiographic variables was analysed, and collagen biomarker concentrations were compared between MYBPC3 mutation positive and negative cats, without left ventricular hypertrophy.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of the MYBPC3 gene and the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of the MYBPC3 gene and the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of the MYBPC3 gene and the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients.\nContext 8: The", "#1: Yes, it does. The results showed that the catechin-rich OPL dose dependently increased the OVX bone density and structure, femur and tibia masses (by +8% and +12% respectively), ash (by +30% and +20% respectively), calcium (by +3% and +5%), and T-ALP concentrations (by +76%) compared with the OVX rats. The increases by OPL were higher than that in OVX + GT and control intact rats.\n#2: No, it does not. The results showed that the OVX control rats had significantly decreased femur and tibia masses (-5% and -3%, respectively), ash (-15% and -10", "Question: Does lifetime history of major depression predict the development of the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women??\nExplanation: The association between major depression and the metabolic syndrome has been reported in several studies. However, the association is not consistent across studies. In a recent meta-analysis, the association between major depression and the metabolic syndrome was found to be significant in women but not in men. In addition, the association was found to be stronger in women with a history of diabetes or CVD. In this study, we examined the association between major depression and the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women. We found that a lifetime history of major depression was associated with the development of the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women. The association was stronger in women with a history", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To prove that Bacillus thuringiensis serovar shandongiensis strain 89-T-34-22 produces several novel cytotoxic proteins against human leukaemic T cells.\nContext 2: Among 42 selected Bacillus strains, only B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) solubilised protoxins showed biological activity against C. capitata neonate larvae, whereas Bti spore and crystal mixture was inactive. Insecticidal activity of Bti protoxins was significantly enhanced by incubation with Culex pipiens L. gut extracts. Overdigestion of Bti protoxins with Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) gut extracts suppressed biological activity against C. capitata, and this correlated with degradation of Cyt toxins. Cyt1Aa solubilised protoxin showed the highest toxicity, LC(50) after 7 days of 4.93 microg cm(-2), while proteolytical processing of Cyt1Aa protoxins by larval gut extracts did not enhance insecticidal activity.\nContext 3: The commercial release of rice genetically engineered to express a Cry1Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for control of Lepidoptera in China is a subject of debate. One major point of the debate has focused on the ecological safety of Bt rice on nontarget organisms, especially predators and parasitoids that help control populations of insect pests.\nContext 4: Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) is one of the world's most destructive fruit pests. The aim of this study was to ascertain insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) delta-endotoxins to C. capitata.\nContext 5: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin is the standard treatment for patients with nonmuscle invasive high histological grade bladder cancer. Previously we found that bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin induces murine bladder cancer MB49 cell death in vitro and in vivo, generating tissue remodeling, which involves the release of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does bacillus thuringiensis serovar shandongiensis strain 89-T-34-22 produce several novel cytotoxic proteins against human leukaemic T cells?\nYes, bacillus thuringiensis serovar shandongiensis strain 89-T-34-22 produces several novel cytotoxic proteins against human leukaemic T cells.\nNo, bacillus thuringiensis serovar shandongiensis strain 89-T-34-22 does not produce several novel cytotoxic proteins against human leukaemic T cells.\nMaybe, bacillus thuringiensis serovar shandongiensis strain 89-T-34-22 produces several novel cytotoxic proteins against human leukaemic T cells.\nThe context 1 is about the insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis", "Question: Is routine postoperative intensive care monitoring necessary after radical cystectomy??\nExplanation: The answer is no.

Similarly, adipose tissue from the HFD sedentary mice contained higher levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 mRNA and increased numbers of CD11c inflammatory macrophages and CD8 T cells than adipose tissue from the ND mice, and those were also lowered by exercise training. The mRNA levels of monocyte chemoattractant proteins 1 and 2 and macrophage inflammatory proteins 1\u03b1 and 1\u03b2 in adipose tissue were lower in the HFD exercise mice than those in the HFD sedentary mice.\nContext 2: Macrophages are important producers of obesity-induced MCP-1; however, initial obesity-induced increases in MCP-1 production precede M1 macrophage accumulation in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). The initial cellular source of obesity-induced MCP-1 in\u00a0vivo is currently unknown. Preliminary reports based on in\u00a0vitro studies of preadipocyte cell lines and adherent stroma-vascular fraction cells suggest that resident stromal cells express MCP-1. In the past several years, elegant methods of identifying adipocyte progenitor cells (AdPCs) have become available, making it possible to study these cells in\u00a0vivo. We have previously published that global deletion of transcription factor Inhibitor of Differentiation 3 (Id3) attenuates high fat diet-induced obesity, but it is unclear if Id3 plays a role in diet-induced MCP-1 production. We sought to determine the initial cellular source of MCP-1 and identify molecular regulators mediating MCP-1 production.\nContext 3: Recent findings point towards an important role of local macrophage proliferation also in obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation that underlies insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Osteopontin (OPN) is an inflammatory cytokine highly upregulated in adipose tissue (AT) of obese and has repeatedly been shown to be functionally involved in adipose-tissue inflammation and metabolic sequelae. In the present work, we aimed at unveiling both the role of OPN in human monocyte and macrophage proliferation as well as the impact of OPN deficiency on local macrophage proliferation in a mouse model for diet-induced obesity.\nContext 4: OPN not only enhanced survival and decreased apoptosis of human monocytes but also induced proliferation similar to macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). OPN also induced proliferation of human monocytes and macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. OPN induced proliferation of human monocytes and macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. OPN induced proliferation of human monocytes and macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. OPN induced proliferation of human monocytes and macrophages in a dose-dependent manner.

DNA, from mononuclear blood cells was genotyped for CYP3A5, MDR-1 and MAPT polym", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Cholangiocytes expose a striking resistance against bile acids: while other cell types, such as hepatocytes, are susceptible to bile acid-induced toxicity and apoptosis already at micromolar concentrations, cholangiocytes are continuously exposed to millimolar concentrations as present in bile. We present a hypothesis suggesting that biliary secretion of HCO(3)(-) in man serves to protect cholangiocytes against bile acid-induced damage by fostering the deprotonation of apolar bile acids to more polar bile salts. Here, we tested if bile acid-induced toxicity is pH-dependent and if anion exchanger 2 (AE2) protects against bile acid-induced damage.\nContext 2: Bicarbonate is a major component of bile salt independent bile flow, which is impaired in ethinyl estradiol (EE)-cholestasis. To examine this subject in EE-cholestasis, we studied: 1) basal and glucagon-stimulated biliary bicarbonate secretion both in vivo and in the isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL); 2) H+/HCO-3 transport processes in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets.\nContext 3: Although bile acids have been implicated in colon cancer development, their role in biliary tract carcinogenesis remains unexplored. Because receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 have been implicated in carcinogenesis, we examined the hypothesis that bile acids modulate these enzymes in KMBC cells, a human cholangiocarcinoma cell line.\nContext 4: Bile stones represent a highly prevalent condition and abnormalities of the biliary tree predispose to stone recurrence due to development of biliary stasis. In our study, we assessed the importance of an altered bile duct course for stone formation.\nContext 5: 20 patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to a combination of UDCA (1 g/day during 3 weeks before surgery) and RIFA (600 mg/day during 1 week before surgery), or no treatment. Routine biochemistry, lipids, bile acid synthesis (7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, C-4) and FGF19 were measured in serum. Bile acids were analyzed in serum and bile. A wedge liver biopsy was taken for determination of expression of hepatobiliary ABC transporters on mRNA and protein levels and of enzymes and regulatory transcription factors involved in the metabolism of biliary compounds on mRNA levels.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a low-fat diet on the expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport in the rat liver. The expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport was studied in the liver of rats fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks. The expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport was studied in the liver of rats fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks.

A dose of 5 mg. finasteride daily reduces ejaculate volume by approximately 25%, and reduces prostate volume by approximately 20% and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) by approximately 50% in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. To our knowledge no data exist on the effect of 1 mg. finasteride daily on ejaculate volume or other semen parameters, or on the prostate in young men. Therefore, we studied the potential effect and reversibility of effect of 1 mg. finasteride daily on spermatogenesis, semen production, the prostate and serum PSA in young men.\nContext 2: There were no significant effects of 1 mg. finasteride on sperm concentration, total sperm per ejaculate, sperm motility or morphology. Ejaculate volume in subjects on finasteride decreased 0.3 ml. (-11%) compared to a decrease of 0.2 ml. (-8%) for placebo, with a median between treatment group difference of -0.03 ml. (1%, 90% confidence interval -10.4 to 13.1, p = 0.915). There were significant but small decreases in prostate volume (-2.6%) and serum PSA (-0.2 ng./ml.) in the finasteride group, which reversed on discontinuation of the drug.\nContext 3: In this double-blind, placebo controlled multicenter study 181 men 19 to 41 years old were randomized to receive 1 mg. finasteride or placebo for 48 weeks followed by a 60-week off-drug period. Of the 181 men 79 were included in a subset for the collection and analysis of sequential semen samples.\nContext 4: Finasteride caused a significant decrease in serum dihydrotestosterone after 6 and 12 months, but no effect on serum testosterone. Vertebral bone mineral density remained unaltered. None of the other parameters monitored were affected except for a small unexplained increase in 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the group receiving 5 mg finasteride/day.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to study the influence of active disease status and TNF-\u03b1 antagonists on sperm quality in a group of AS patients.\n\nBased on the results of this study, we conclude that finasteride does not affect semen parameters in young men. However, the effect of finasteride on prostate volume and serum PSA is reversible. The effect of finasteride on sperm concentration, total sperm per ejaculate, sperm motility and morphology is not significant. The effect of finasteride on prostate volume and serum PSA is reversible. The effect of finasteride on sperm concentration, total sperm per ejaculate, sperm motility and morphology is not significant.

The control group without significant CAD was composed of 20 patients aged 73 +/- 4 years (P = not significant [NS]). There was no difference with respect to prevalence of hypertension, use of calcium-channel blockers, and history of smoking. There was no difference between the groups with regard to the number of premature atrial contractions (467 +/- 759 [experimental] vs 672 +/- 1789 [control]; P = NS); premature ventricular contractions (359 +/- 599 [experimental] vs 290 +/- 858 [control]; P = NS); and prevalence of ventricular couplets, ventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia (all P = NS).\nContext 3: Patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) underwent an acute hemodynamic study to determine the %change in LV+dP/dtmax from baseline atrial pacing compared to the following configurations: BiV pacing with the LV lead in a one of lateral veins, while pacing from the distal, mid, or proximal electrode and all 3 electrodes together (i.e. MSP). All measurements were repeated 4 times at 5 different atrioventricular delays. We also measured QRS-width and individual Q-LV durations.\nContext 4: After subjects with atrial fibrillation, subjects with a history of CVD, and subjects receiving antihypertensive treatment were excluded, 17,766 subjects (5958 men), aged 40-79 (mean 61.5) years, were analyzed. The RPR at baseline was categorized into four groups (RPR<60, 60-69.5, 70-79.5, \u226580 beats per minute (bpm)) using the average value of two consecutive measurements. The endpoint was set as the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death.\nContext 5: In the control period, rapid pacing induced a significant 14% reduction (P<.01) in right atrial ERP and an 8% decrease (P<.01) in the right atrial effective refractory period (ERP). In the pacing period, rapid pacing induced a significant 14% increase (P<.01) in right atrial ERP and a 10% increase (P<.01) in the right atrial effective refractory period. The increase in ERP was significantly greater than the increase in effective refractory period (P<.01). The increase in ERP was significantly greater than the increase in effective refractory period (P<.01).

The purpose of the current study was to estimate the impact of endoscopic surveillance on colorectal cancer-specific survival for persons with localized or regional colorectal cancer. The population included Medicare patients (age >or=65 years) who were diagnosed with local or regional stage colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1996.\nContext 2: The analysis group contained 8130 cases (29%) and 20,079 controls (71%). The average time to first bowel surveillance for those with at least 1 surveillance examination was 15.9 months after the diagnosis (median, 13 months). In the regression analysis, surveillance endoscopy was not found to be associated with improved colorectal cancer-specific survival (odds ratio of 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.06 [P=0.85]). Setting the surveillance interval to 12 months and 15 months rather than 6 months after diagnosis did not appear to influence the results.\nContext 3: From January 2005 to September 2011, colonoscopy cohort showed that a total of 72 patients with small colorectal cancers with the size less than 20 mm underwent colonoscopy at the Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. Among them, 8 patients were excluded due to incomplete medical records. Finally, a total of 64 ECCs with submucosa (SM) invasion and size less than 20 mm were included. One hundred fifty-two adenomas with size less than 20 mm were included as controls. Nine endoscopic features, including seven morphological findings (i.e., loss of lobulation, excavation, demarcated and depressed areas, stalk swelling, fullness, fold convergence, and bleeding ulcers), pit patterns, and non-lifting signs, were evaluated retrospectively. All endoscopic features were evaluated by two experienced endoscopists who have each performed over 1000 colonoscopies annually for more than five years without knowledge of the histology.\nContext 4: The current study was a retrospective case-control study. Cases were defined as those individuals who died of colorectal cancer and controls were defined as those with colorectal cancer who did not die of colorectal cancer; controls were frequency matched to cases. Surveillance was defined as the use of colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy for the detection of colorectal cancer. The primary outcome was colorectal cancer-specific survival. The secondary outcome was the risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality.\nContext 5: The results showed that the risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality was significantly higher in the surveillance group than in the non-surveillance group (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.40; P=0.004). The risk of colorectal cancer-specific mortality was significantly higher in the surveillance group than in the non-surveillance group (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.40; P=0.004).", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Based on the probe sequence analysis, we proposed two possible splice variants, GABAB1j and GABAB1k. The existence of human GABAB1j was verified by quantitative real-time PCR, and mouse GABAB1j was found from a microarray probe set based on human GABAB1j sequence. GABAB1j open reading frames (ORF) and expression patterns are not conserved across species, and they do not have any important functional domains except sushi domains. Thus, we focused on another possible splice variant, GABAB1k. After obtaining PCR evidence for GABAB1k existence from human, mouse, and rat, it was cloned from human and mouse by PCR along with three additional isoforms, GABAB1l, GABAB1m, and GABAB1n. Their expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR are relatively low in brain although they may be expressed in specific cell types. GABAB1l and GABAB1m inhibit GABAB receptor-induced G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel (GIRK) currents at Xenopus oocyte two-electrode voltage clamp system.\nContext 2: Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors decrease neural activity through G protein signaling. There are two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2. Alternative splicing provides GABAB1 with structural and functional diversity. cDNA microarrays showed strong signals from human brain RNA using GABAB1 intron 4 region probes. Therefore, we predicted the existence of novel splice variants.\nContext 3: We studied the role of GABA(B) receptors in the spontaneous PPI deficits displayed by DBA/2J mice.\nContext 4: gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a dominant inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in the modulation of brain electric activity and puberty onset in primates. GABA inhibitory effects on GnRH neurons are mainly mediated by GABA-A receptor alpha1-subunit.\nContext 5: The potency of GABA was significantly higher in the alpha1beta2, alpha4beta2 and alpha5beta2 receptors compared with the alpha1beta2gamma2L, alpha4beta2gamma2L and alpha5beta2gamma2L receptors. However, the alpha5beta2 receptor possessed significantly lower GABA efficacy compared with the alpha5beta2gamma2L receptor. The alpha5beta2 receptor was also more sensitive to GABA than the alpha5beta2gamma2L receptor. The alpha5beta2 receptor was also more sensitive to GABA than the alpha5beta2gamma2L receptor. The alpha5beta2 receptor was also more sensitive to GABA than the alpha5beta2gamma2L receptor. The alpha5beta2 receptor was also more sensitive to GABA than the alpha5beta2gamma2L receptor.

Based on the change in the total SLEDAI-2K scores on last visit, patients were grouped as improved, flared/worsened, and unchanged. Patients showing improvement were evaluated for the presence of new active descriptors at last visit compared with baseline visit.\nContext 3: In clinical practice, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose a relapse in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) having potential complications, including renal failure and death. Some immunological markers can help to determine their association with LN and, therefore, diagnose the early onset of complications.\nContext 4: A longitudinal study of clinical and serological disease manifestations registered during 2,412 patient months of follow-up in a well-defined lupus cohort. Organ-specific disease manifestations, the modified SLE disease activity index (M-SLEDAI) score, disease flares (M-SLEDAI increase > or =3) and predictive value of anti-dsDNA Ab testing [by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) and Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence (CLIFT) assays] were related to past anti-dsDNA Ab status.\nContext 5: Detailed demographic, environmental, clinical, and therapeutic information was collected by questionnaire on 1242 SLE patients, 981 FDRs, and 946 controls in the Lupus Family Registry and Repository; a blood sample was obtained. All sera were tested for multiple lupus autoantibodies by immunofluorescence and luminex bead-based assays. Generalized estimating equations, adjusting for age, gender, and ethnicity and accounting for correlation within families, were used to assess smoking status with the dichotomous outcome variables of positivity for SLE status, positivity of ANA by immunofluorescence (\u22651:120), positivity for \u22651 autoantibody by the luminex assay, and positivity for each of the 11 autoantibodies.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\n1.

Bowel movements were registered for 1 week. Endoscopic biopsies from the sigmoid colon were mounted in modified Ussing chambers and assessed for short-circuit current (I(sc)), transepithelial resistance (TER), and transmucosal passage of chemically killed Escherichia coli K12.\nContext 2: Budesonide may be an effective therapy for mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to demonstrate non-inferiority for oral 9mg budesonide once daily (OD) versus 3g mesalazine granules OD.\nContext 3: Collagenous colitis is increasingly recognized as a common diarrheal disorder of inflammatory origin. Intestinal inflammation is generally associated with increased mucosal permeability, but little is known about barrier function in microscopic colitis. Our aim was to investigate the mucosal barrier to nonpathogenic bacteria in collagenous colitis.\nContext 4: Bacterial uptake was increased in patients in remission, 1.6 U (1.1-3.0) and in those with active disease, 4.6 U (2.5-5.8; median (IQR)), compared to controls, 0.7 U (0.1-1.1; P=0.004 and P-0.001, respectively). Active disease also had significant decrease in transepithelial resistance (TER) after 120 min, -9.7 Omega cm(2) ((-13)-(-4.3)), compared to controls, -5.2 Omega cm(2) ((-7.2)-(-3.1)), P-0.03; or patients in remission, -4.8 Omega cm(2) ((-8.0)-(-1.2)), P=0.04. Budesonide decreased median stool frequency to 1.9 (1.3-2.2) compared to 3.8 (3.7-4.2) before treatment (P=0.01), but bacterial uptake was still increased after budesonide 2.9 U (1.5-3.8), (P=0.01).

The authors hypothesized that ondansetron pretreatment would reduce the duration of sensory and motor block produced by ropivacaine. The authors found that ondansetron pretreatment did not reduce the duration of sensory or motor block produced by ropivacaine. The authors concluded that ondansetron pretreatment does not antagonize the duration of sensory and motor block produced by ropivacaine.\nContext 1: We investigated a possible effect of ondans", "No, staging error does not explain the relationship between the number of lymph nodes in a colon cancer specimen and survival.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To use stem cell therapy effectively, it is important to enhance the therapeutic potential of stem cells with soluble factors. Although sonic hedgehog (shh) is important in maintaining the stem cell, the recovery effect of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with shh has not yet been elucidated. The present study investigated the effect of mESCs with shh in skin recovery in vivo as well as the related intracellular signal pathways in vitro.\nContext 2: The healing effect of mESCs with shh on skin wounds was examined in vivo in ICR mice. The involvement of Smads, the microRNA (miR)-200 family, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEBs) and E-cadherin on shh-induced mESC migration and self-renewal was determined in vitro.\nContext 3: We hypothesized that delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a biomimetic collagen scaffold improves wound healing in a diabetic mouse model.\nContext 4: The mESCs with shh increased re-epithelialization and VEGF expression in skin wounds. Shh-treated mESCs increased both secreted and intracellular levels of VEGF. Shh induced dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 through the Smoothened receptor and increased the phosphorylation of Smad1 and Smad2/3 in mESCs. Shh-induced decrease of the mmu-miR-141, -200c, -200a, -200b and -429 expression levels was significantly reversed by Smad4 siRNA. Shh increased nuclear expression of ZEB1/ZEB2 and decreased E-cadherin expression while increasing cell migration and skin wound healing. Both these effects were reversed by mmu-miR-141 and -200b mimics.\nContext 5: Sox9 expression can be first detected in the epithelial component of the hair placode but then becomes restricted to the outer root sheath (ORS) and the hair stem cell compartment (bulge). Using tissue-specific inactivation of Sox9, we demonstrate that this gene serves a crucial role in hair differentiation and that skin deleted for Sox9 lacks external hair. Strikingly, the ORS acquires epidermal characteristics with ectopic expression of GATA3. Moreover, Sox9 knock hair show severe proliferative defects and the stem cell niche never forms. Finally, we show that Sox9 is required for the maintenance of the hair follicle stem cell compartment.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the stem cell factor (SCF) on the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) in vitro and in vivo.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the stem cell factor (SCF) on the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) in vitro and in vivo.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the stem cell factor (SCF) on the proliferation and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs)", "definitely yes\nExplanation: Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor family of growth factors.

Variables, such as blood eosinophil counts, total IgE levels, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) levels, or FEV1 percent predicted, might predict airway eosinophil percentages, whereas age, FEV1 percent predicted, or blood neutrophil counts might predict sputum neutrophil percentages. Availability and ease of measurement are useful characteristics, but accuracy in predicting airway eosinophil and neutrophil percentages either individually or combined is not established.\nContext 2: Despite significant association with sputum eosinophil percentages, blood eosinophil counts, Feno levels, and total IgE levels did not accurately predict sputum eosinophil percentages, and combinations of these variables did not improve prediction. Age, FEV1 percent predicted, and blood neutrophil counts were similarly unsatisfactory for the prediction of sputum neutrophil percentages. Factor analysis and stepwise selection found Feno levels, IgE levels, and FEV1 percent predicted, but not blood eosinophil counts, correctly predicted 69% of sputum eosinophil percentages of less than 2% or 2% and greater. Likewise, age, asthma duration, and blood neutrophil counts correctly predicted 64% of sputum neutrophil percentages of less than 40% or 40% and greater. A\u00a0model to predict both sputum eosinophil and neutrophil percentages accurately assigned only 41% of samples.\nContext 3: Levels of HDM-specific IgE antibodies in induced sputum were significantly higher in asthmatic patients than in controls (P <.01). In asthmatic patients, levels of HDM-specific IgE antibodies were significantly higher in induced sputum samples with eosinophilia (sputum eosinophil count > or = 5% of 200 counted non-squamous cells) than in those without eosinophilia (P <.05). There were no significant differences in serum levels of HDM-specific IgE antibodies between asthmatic patients with sputum eosinophilia and asthmatic patients without sputum eosinophilia. In asthmatic patients, sputum ECP levels were significantly higher in induced sputum samples with eosinophilia than in those without eosinophilia (P <.05). There were no significant differences in serum levels of ECP between asthmatic patients with sputum eosinophilia and asthmatic patients without sputum eosinophilia.\nContext 4: The results of this study suggest that the presence of sputum eosinophilia is associated with the presence of sputum neutrophilia and that the presence of sputum neutrophilia is associated with the presence of sputum eosinophilia. The presence of sputum eosinophilia is associated with the presence of sputum neutrophilia and the presence of sputum eosinophilia is", "No, short-term oral isotretinoin therapy does not cause clinical or subclinical peripheral neuropathy.\nExplanation: The objective of this prospective study was to investigate whether short-term treatment with oral isotretinoin can also affect peripheral nerve function.

They form active constituents of a number of herbal and traditional medicines. Several flavonoids have been shown to exert their action by interacting with DNA topoisomerases and promoting site-specific DNA cleavage. Therefore, flavonoids are potential candidates in drug design. We report here that, although the flavonoids luteolin and quercetin are potent antileishmanial agents, luteolin has great promise for acting as a lead compound in the chemotherapy of leishmaniasis, a major concern in developing countries.\nContext 2: Luteolin and quercetin inhibited the growth of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes in vitro, inhibited DNA synthesis in promastigotes, and promoted topoisomerase-II-mediated linearization of kDNA minicircles. The IC50 values of luteolin and quercetin were 12.5 microM and 45.5 microM, respectively. These compounds arrest cell cycle progression in L. donovani promastigotes, leading to apoptosis. Luteolin has no effect on normal human T-cell blasts. Both luteolin and quercetin reduced splenic parasite burden in animal models.\nContext 3: Lipid-associated formulations of antileishmanial agents have proved to be more effective therapies with reduced toxicities. Previous studies from our group and others revealed that liposomes bearing phosphatidylcholine and stearylamine (SA) themselves kill Leishmania and other protozoan parasites in vitro and in vivo, without causing any adverse effect on host. In the present study, we offer detailed insights into the mechanism of action of these liposomes.\nContext 4: Herein, we provide evidence for induction of membrane disruption by specific interaction with surface phosphatidylserine (PS) of Leishmania promastigotes and amastigotes, phospholipids normally not found on mammalian cell surface, with SA-containing liposomes. Cell surface PS on different forms of Leishmania facilitated liposome-induced parasite killing. The target selectivity of the liposomes was further proved through inhibition of antileishmanial activity with annexinV, and strong affinity with anionic PS rather than phosphatidic acid-containing liposomes for leishmanicidal activity.\nContext 5: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the antileishmanial activity of a novel liposomal formulation of amphotericin B (LAMB) in vitro and in vivo. LAMB was encapsulated in liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol (Chol), and stearylamine (SA). The liposomal formulation was prepared by the thin-film hydration method. The liposomal formulation was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic light scattering. The in vitro antileishmanial activity of LAMB was evaluated by the promastigote growth inhibition assay. The in vivo antileishmanial activity of LAMB was evaluated by the intraperitoneal", "Question: Is sex everything : the role of gender in early performance of a fundamental laparoscopic skill??\nThe study was designed to look at the conversion rates and morbidity associated with laparoscopic operations performed by trainee surgeons ascending the learning curve when they are well supervised by staff surgeons.\nThe study was designed to look at the conversion rates and morbidity associated with laparoscopic operations performed by trainee surgeons ascending the learning curve when they are well supervised by staff surgeons.\nThe study was designed to look at the conversion rates and morbidity associated with laparoscopic operations performed by trainee surgeons ascending the learning curve when they are well supervised by staff surgeons.\nThe study was designed to look at the conversion rates and morbidity associated with lap", "Explanation: The sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is a minimally invasive procedure that identifies the first lymph node(s) to receive metastatic melanoma cells.

Here, we focus on comparing efficacy of anti-diabetic dietary (DLI) and two drug treatments, namely PPARA agonist fenofibrate and LXR agonist T0901317. By combining knowledge-based and data-driven networks with a random walks based algorithm, we extracted network signatures that link the DLI and two drug interventions to dyslipidemia-related disease parameters.\nContext 1: We set out to discover key", "Question: Is arthrogenic muscle inhibition present in the limb contralateral to a simulated knee joint effusion??\nYes, arthrogenic muscle inhibition is present in the limb contralateral to a simulated knee joint effusion.\nThe purpose of this investigation was to estimate bilateral neuromuscular activity in the vastus medialis on induction of a unilateral knee joint effusion.\nEight subjects each were assigned to effusion or control groups. The effusion group had 60 ml of sterile saline injected into their superolateral knee joint capsules. The control group rested for 8 mins. Bilateral recruitment curves for the Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) and muscle response (M-wave) were obtained before and 10,", "Question: Does ketorolac reduce effectiveness of pleurodesis in pediatric patients with spontaneous pneumothorax??\nExplanation: Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to reduce pain and inflammation. It is commonly used in the treatment of acute pain and inflammation. It is also used in the treatment of acute pain associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). It is thought to reduce the effectiveness of pleurodesis in pediatric patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. We reviewed our experience with children undergoing video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) with pleurodesis for pneumothorax to determine if ketorolac", "No, managerial leadership is not associated with employee stress, health, and sickness absence independently of the demand-control", "Question: Does allocation of renal grafts to older recipients result in loss of functioning graft-years?\nYes, it does. The probability distribution for receiving a kidney transplantation is displaced to the right compared with the age distribution of graft donors. This gap increases as the procuring hospitals enlist progressively older graft candidates without accepting older donors in parallel. An allocation system that maintains age parity between donors and recipients is fairer that other that allows lax criteria for the same allocation. This phenomenon is attenuated if the procurement acceptance criterion allows older donors.\nContext 5: Based in the age distribution of donors and waiting list of patients for kidney transplantation, we constructed probability functions for receiving a graft as an allocation system based on age changes from a strict to a more lax criteria", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Our objective was to quantify the pharmacokinetics of methadone and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of peginterferon alfa-2a (40 kd) in patients with chronic hepatitis C undergoing methadone maintenance therapy.\nContext 2: Adults with chronic hepatitis C who had been receiving a consistent methadone maintenance regimen for at least 3 months were eligible for this open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized drug interaction study. All patients received 180 microg subcutaneous peginterferon alfa-2a once weekly for 4 weeks and continued their methadone regimen. Serial blood samples were collected at baseline and immediately before and for up to 168 hours after study drug administration for the purposes of quantifying methadone and peginterferon alfa-2a serum concentrations, measuring serum 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, and determining hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid levels.\nContext 3: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Methadone exposure, as measured by maximum serum concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) normalized to a 100-mg/d dose, after 4 doses of peginterferon alfa-2a increased by 10% to 15% when compared with baseline. The week 4/baseline ratio of the mean C(max) was 1.11 (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.22), and for AUC from time 0 to 24 hours, the week 4/baseline ratio was 1.15 (90% CI, 1.08-1.23). The mean accumulation ratios (week 4/first dose) for C(max) and AUC from time 0 to 168 hours of peginterferon alfa-2a were 2.1 and 2.3, respectively.\nContext 4: Plasma exposures of total, R-, and S-methadone were not affected by co-administration of DTG. Mean ratios for AUC were 0.98, 0.95, and 1.01 for total, R-, and S-methadone, respectively, alone compared with in combination with DTG. No statistically significant differences were noted between the 2 treatment periods in methadone PD measures. The combination of DTG and methadone was well tolerated. No deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations due to adverse events were reported.\nContext 5: The combination of methadone and DTG was well tolerated.

PCR assays were designed for each gene, and used to screen 107 faecal strains from various hosts and 106 environmental strains from surface water and sediment. While none of the 14 accessory genes were ecotype-specific, six of the genes were ecotype-enriched. Specifically, toxin-antitoxin system genes were more abundant among faecal strains, whereas genes involved in iron acquisition, complement resistance/surface exclusion, and biofilm formation were more abundant among environmental strains. These six genes were used to form composite fingerprints which revealed the presence of several ecotype-specific and -enriched fingerprints. Notably, some of the environmental strain-specific or -enriched fingerprints consisted of strains putatively belonging to clade ET-1, which has been previously recognized as a naturalized subpopulation.\nContext 3: We report the first examples of bla(CTX-M-15) in UK river sediment; the prevalence of bla(CTX-M-15) was dramatically increased downstream of the WWTP. Ten novel genetic contexts for this gene were identified, carried in pathogens such as Escherichia coli ST131 as well as indigenous aquatic bacteria such as Aeromonas media. The bla(CTX-M-15) -gene was readily transferable to other Gram-negative bacteria. We also report the first finding of an imipenem-resistant E. coli in a UK river.\nContext 4: Oral samples were obtained from 17 participants with known previous carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli. No ESBL-producing bacteria or ESBL genes were detected using culture-based and molecular methods. One colony of Rahnella aquatilis harboring the class A ESBL gene bla RAHN-1/2 was identified in an oral sample from one of the participants.\nContext 5: Comparison of genomic DNA among closely related strains or species is a powerful approach for identifying variation in evolutionary processes. One potent source of genomic variation is gene duplication, which is prevalent among individuals and species. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been successfully utilized to detect this variation among lineages. Here, beyond the demonstration that gene duplicates among species are detectable by aCGH, we show that aCGH can be used to detect gene duplicates among closely related strains. We demonstrate that aCGH can be used to detect gene duplicates among closely related strains, and that the number of gene duplicates detected by aCGH is proportional to the number of gene duplicates present in the genome. We also demonstrate that aCGH can be used to detect gene duplicates among closely related strains, and that the number of gene duplicates detected by aCGH is proportional to the number of gene duplicates present in the genome. We also demonstrate that aCGH can be used to detect gene duplicates among closely related strains, and that the number of gene duplicates detected by aCGH is proportional to the number of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Galantamine, a drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has neuroprotection in several experimental models and stimulates adult neurogenesis in the rodent brain, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study examined whether galantamine affects the expression of neurotrophic/growth factors in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.\nContext 2: Acute administration of galantamine (0.3-3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) increased IGF2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex, in time- and dose-dependent manner. Galantamine (3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) caused a transient increase in fibroblast growth factor 2 mRNA levels and a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels in the hippocampus, while it did not affect the mRNA levels of other neurotrophic/growth factors. The galantamine-induced increase in the hippocampal IGF2 mRNA levels was blocked by mecamylamine, a nonselective nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) antagonist, and methyllycaconitine, a selective \u03b17 nAChR antagonist, but not by telenzepine, a preferential M(1) muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist. Moreover, the selective \u03b17 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 increased the IGF2 mRNA levels, while donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, did not. Galantamine also increased hippocampal IGF2 protein, which was blocked by methyllycaconitine.\nContext 3: The vulnerability of the hippocampus to the effects of aging has been found to be associated with a decline in growth hormone/insulin like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1), and an increase in oxidative stress. We have evidence that long-living GH-deficient Ames dwarf mice have enhanced antioxidant protection in the periphery but the protection in the central nervous system is less clear.\nContext 4: Accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and cholinergic deficiency are two prominent features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To understand how A\u03b2-induced dysfunction of the nicotinic system may contribute to cognitive impairment in AD, we examined the effect of A\u03b2 on nicotinic regulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region critical for cognitive function.\nContext 5: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of galantamine on the expression of neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of aged rats. The results showed that galantamine increased the expression of IGF2 mRNA in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Galantamine (3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) caused a transient increase in fibroblast growth factor 2 mRNA levels and a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels in the hippocampus, while it did not affect the mRNA levels of other neurotrophic/growth factors. The galantamine-induced increase in the hippocampal", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Serum creatinine is the most commonly used screening test for renal failure. We hypothesized that serum creatinine would underestimate the degree of renal failure in elderly people because they have a reduced muscle mass. If so, this would lead to underrecognition and thus suboptimal care of patients with severe renal failure.\nContext 2: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of all patients 65 years or older in an outpatient academic family medicine practice. The glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula and was used to evaluate the testing characteristics of serum creatinine for the detection of renal failure.\nContext 3: We screened 1510 patients, 854 (56.6%) of whom met the inclusion criteria. Renal failure (glomerular filtration rate, </=50 mL/min) was present in 28.9% of the patients, and severe renal failure (Cockcroft and Gault formula glomerular filtration rate, </=30 mL/min) was present in 6.4%. A serum creatinine level of greater than 1.7 mg/dL (>150 micro mol/L) had a sensitivity of 12.6% and a specificity of 99.9% for the detection of renal failure. For the detection of severe renal failure, the sensitivity was 45.5%, with a 99.1% specificity. Only 15 (27.3%) of the 55 patients with severe renal failure were referred to a nephrologist. Moreover, 34 (85%) of the 40 nonreferred patients with severe renal failure were incompletely evaluated regarding the metabolic complications associated with kidney dysfunction.\nContext 4: CGN patients (121 in total) with a serum creatinine level of 6 mg/dl were studied. They were subdivided into six groups depending on their protein intake: 0.3 g/kg BW/day (0.3 g), 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and > or =0.8 g (control group C). Deterioration of renal function was evaluated by the mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance, and the amount of protein intake was estimated on the basis of the urea nitrogen appearance rate in a 24-hour urine sample.\nContext 5: We studied 170 consecutive patients with progressive renal insufficiency referred to a single nephrology unit and subsequently dialysed. Reciprocal creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year. The mean rate of decline in creatinine clearance was 0.5 mL/min per year.

It is a sign of inflammation in the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) and is a predictor of radiographic progression in axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).\n#2: No, backfill is not a specific sign of axial SpA seen on MRI. It is a sign of inflammation in the SIJ and is not specific for axial SpA.\n#3: Maybe, backfill is not a specific sign of axial SpA seen on MRI. It is a sign of inflammation in the SIJ and is not specific for axial SpA.\n#4: No, backfill is not a specific", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Here, we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, three transcriptional regulators implicated in phyllotaxis, PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7, are expressed in incipient lateral root primordia where they are required for primordium development and lateral root emergence. Furthermore, all three PLT proteins prevent the formation of primordia close to one another, because, in their absence, successive lateral root primordia are frequently grouped in close longitudinal or radial clusters. The triple plt mutant phenotype is rescued by PLT-vYFP fusion proteins, which are expressed in the shoot meristem as well as the root, but not by expression of PLT7 in the shoot alone. Expression of all three PLT genes requires auxin response factors ARF7 and ARF19, and the reintroduction of PLT activity suffices to rescue lateral root formation in arf7,arf19.\nContext 2: In the present study, a gene encoding a putative WRKY family member, GhWRKY15, was isolated from cotton. GhWRKY15 is present as a single copy gene, and a transient expression analysis indicated that GhWRKY15 was localised to the nucleus. Additionally, a group of cis-acting elements associated with the response to environmental stress and plant growth and development were detected in the promoter. Consistently, northern blot analysis showed that GhWRKY15 expression was significantly induced in cotton seedlings following fungal infection or treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or methyl viologen. Furthermore, GhWRKY15-overexpressing tobacco exhibited more resistance to viral and fungal infections compared with wild-type tobacco. The GhWRKY15-overexpressing tobacco also exhibited increased RNA expression of several pathogen-related genes, NONEXPRESSOR OF PR1, and two genes that encode enzymes involved in ET biosynthesis. Importantly, increased activity of the antioxidant enzymes POD and APX during infection and enhanced expression of NtAPX1 and NtGPX in transgenic tobacco following methyl viologen treatment were observed. Moreover, GhWRKY15 transcription was greater in the roots and stems compared with the expression in the cotyledon of cotton, and the stems of transgenic plants displayed faster elongation at the earlier shooting stages compared with wide type tobacco. Additionally, exposure to abiotic stresses, including cold, wounding and drought, resulted in the accumulation of GhWRKY15 protein in the leaves of transgenic tobacco. Taken together, these results suggest that GhWRKY15 is a novel gene that plays a role in plant defence and stress responses.\nContext 3: The Arabidopsis thaliana gene PLT7 is required for the formation of lateral root primordia. Here, we show that PLT7 is a transcriptional repressor of the PLT3 and PLT5 genes. PLT7 binds to the PLT3 and PLT5 promoters and represses their expression. PLT7 is also required for the expression of the PLT3 and PLT5 genes in the shoot. PLT7 is expressed in the shoot meristem and in the root, but not in the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To establish the significance of chromosome 17 aberrations in the biology of neuroblastomas, the fresh-frozen material of 53 primary neuroblastomas (average patient age: 20.8 months; stage 1 or 2: n = 10; stage 3: n = 10; stage 4: n = 10; stage 4s: n = 23) was studied by means of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Follow-up data were available for 52 of 53 cases studied (average follow-up period: 26.4 months). Except for one, all cases had previously been analyzed for MYCN status (semiquantitative Southern blot analysis). Studies of LOH 1p36 (VNTR-PCR) had been performed on 28 of 53 cases.\nContext 2: In several studies, gain of the distal long arm of chromosome 17 was shown to be a frequent and prognostically relevant factor in neuroblastoma, in addition to MYCN amplification (MNA) or 1p deletion. We asked whether this observation could be confirmed in a German cohort.\nContext 3: To evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of 17q gain, we investigated tissue samples from 193 neuroblastoma patients by the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization. The DNA probe (MPO) was located in distal 17q in the region of interest as used by several groups. To analyze the association of patients' outcome with the breakpoint position within 17q, we used the more proximal DNA probe ERBB2 in 17q21 on a selected number of cases. Gain was defined as an excess of 17q material compared with the chromosome 17 centromere in at least 50% of the analyzed tumor cells. In addition, alterations in chromosomes 1p, 3p, and 11q, as well as MYCN status, were determined to describe the interrelationship between the different parameters and to evaluate an independent prognostic influence.\nContext 4: We therefore analyzed 295 primary neuroblastomas from a representative group of patients for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 25 polymorphic markers spanning 11q.\nContext 5: Neuroblastoma tumorigenesis may involve the differential inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Recent data have suggested that a neuroblastoma suppressor gene may be located on the long arm of chromosome 17. We therefore investigated the frequency of 17q gain in neuroblastoma and its association with MYCN amplification and 1p deletion.\nContext 6: We found that 17q gain was present in 30% of neuroblastomas and was associated with MYCN amplification (P = 0.0001) and 1p deletion (P = 0.0001). In addition, 17q gain was associated with a worse outcome (P = 0.0001). The prognostic impact of 17q gain was independent of MYCN amplification and 1p deletion.\nContext 7: We conclude that 17q gain is a frequent event in neuroblastoma and is associated", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To examine the learning ability of rats shortly after recovery from a bolus dose of propofol by assessing learning on a swim-to-platform task. Also, muscarinic blockade was used as a pharmacological test of whether learning shortly after propofol anesthesia resembles normal learning.\nContext 2: When trained shortly after recovery from the anesthetic, propofol anesthetized rats made 3.2 +/- 0.4 compared with 1.0 +/- 0.1 errors in controls (P < 0.0001). Two to three hours later both groups performed equally well. Rats trained after propofol anesthesia and given scopolamine before testing made 0.7 +/- 0.5 errors and performed as well as normal controls, 1.2 +/- 0.2 errors when subjected to the same procedures without propofol anesthesia, and better than scopolamine-treated untrained rats, 5.5 +/- 0.7 errors, (P < 0.05).\nContext 3: Propofol anesthetized rats (15-20 mg x kg(-1) i.v.) were trained on a swim-to-platform task five to seven minutes after recovering from surgical anesthesia and tested two to three hours later In addition, the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (5 mg x kg(-1) s.c.) was given to a subgroup of rats before testing. During 10 trials, the number of times a given rat took 10 sec or longer to locate and climb onto a visible platform was tabulated and counted as errors.\nContext 4: Sevoflurane anesthesia significantly reduced latency to find the hidden platform in both young adult (n = 10 per treatment, P < 0.0001) and aged rats (n = 7 per treatment, P < 0.0001) when tested 1 week after exposure. In young rats only, this improved acquisition learning was maintained at 4 (P = 0.003) but not at 12 weeks postexposure (P = 0.061). There were no differences in swim speed or in open field exploration between groups (no confounding effects of stress or locomotion). Retention memory measured using probe trials was not affected by exposure to sevoflurane in young adult or aged rats.\nContext 5: The effects of anesthesia with 1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for 1 h on the acquisition and retention of a swim-to-platform task were examined in young adult (n = 10 per treatment) and aged (n = 7 per treatment) rats. The effects of sevoflurane on the acquisition of a swim-to-platform task were examined in young adult (n = 10 per treatment) and aged (n = 7 per treatment) rats. The effects of sevoflurane on the acquisition of a swim-to-platform task were examined in young adult (n = 10 per treatment) and aged (n = 7 per treatment) rats.

U-shaped surgical wire was used for stabilization of the spine. A validated test of mechanical hyperalgesia was used to test the development of neuropathic pain behavior after surgery. Deformity of the spine was evaluated by calculating deviation from the central axis on radiographs obtained in anteroposterior projection.\n\nContext 2: Improved preclinical models are required to address the fundamental question of the relationship between postlaminectomy fibrosis and chronic pain.

The GLI1 oncogene is believed to play a role in the genesis of these tumors. We determined whether GLI1 polymorphisms were risk factors for developing basal cell carcinoma, either alone or in combination with patterns of past sun exposure, and whether there were functional differences among different GLI1 haplotypes.\nContext 3: GLI1 genotypes at c.2798 and c.3298 from 201 basal cell carcinoma patients were compared to 201 age and sex-matched controls. Neither genotype nor haplotype frequencies differed between cases and controls. However, the odds of developing basal cell carcinoma on the trunk compared to the head/neck appeared somewhat lower with carriers of the c.3298GC than the CC genotype. There was no evidence for interactions between skin type, childhood sunburning, average adult sun exposure, adult sunbathing, or intermittency of sun exposure and GLI1 haplotype. Additionally, we found no significant differences in transcription activation or cell transforming ability among the four GLI1 haplotypes.\nContext 4: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer in whites. Long-term exposure to UV radiation is considered a major risk factor. We decided to investigate whether maximally exposed areas of the body are also the most frequent sites where BCCs develop.\nContext 5: A case-control study was performed that included 160 patients age > or = 60 years diagnosed of cutaneous melanoma and 318 controls matched for age and sex. Both groups were assessed, by personal interview and physical examination, for different phenotype characteristics (hair and eye color, phototype), the presence of other cutaneous lesions (solar lentigines, actinic keratoses and nevi), degree and type of solar exposure and personal and family past history of cutaneous or non-cutaneous cancer. Differences were evaluated by contingency tables and univariate and multivariate logistic regression.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\n\n## Context 1\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the need for routine genetic counselling for identification of features of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) in patients presenting with a solitairy keratocystic odontogenic tumour (KCOT) of the jaws.\n## Context 2\nSusceptibility to basal cell carcinoma results from complex interactions between ultraviolet radiation exposure and genetic factors.

Their pleural effusion (n = 17) and amniotic fluid (n = 17) were drawn when disease set in. Eleven fetuses received cordocentesis because of suspected fetal anemia. Forty-one normal fetuses without adverse perinatal outcome at GA 17-29 weeks received amniocentesis and were enrolled in the reference group. Levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), stromal-derived factor-1(SDF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), macrophage migratory inhibition factor (MIF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined in the samples from both groups (amniotic fluid, pleural fluid, and cord blood from the study group and amniotic fluid from the reference group) by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA).\nContext 2: To study the role of selected cytokines and growth factors involved in the pathogenesis of fetal chylous pleural effusion.\nContext 3: The etiology of persistent lung inflammation in preterm infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) is poorly characterized, hampering efforts to stratify prognosis and treatment. Airway macrophages are important innate immune cells with roles in both the induction and resolution of tissue inflammation.\nContext 4: Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) promotes placental growth and maintenance. M-CSF also regulates trophoblast invasion into the placental bed. We evaluated whether M-CSF levels in amniotic fluid during labor contributing to subsequent delivery differed from those before the onset of labor in normal pregnancies.\nContext 5: Strong evidence implicates chronic intra-amniotic inflammation in the etiology of mid-trimester abortion and spontaneous preterm delivery. The purpose of this study was to determine if concentrations of amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase-8, and cytokines such as interleukin-6 and angiogenin can identify patients at risk for spontaneous preterm delivery in patients undergoing mid-trimester amniocentesis.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\n1. The authors found that the levels of HGF, SDF-1, VEGF, IL-8, MIF, and IL-6 in amniotic fluid were significantly higher in fetuses with prenatal chylothorax than in fetuses without prenatal chylothorax. The authors concluded that the levels of these cytokines in amniotic fluid may be useful in predicting the risk of developing prenatal chylothorax.\n2.

Whites appear to have a higher prevalence of CAC than African-Americans (AAs), but it is unknown if type 2 diabetes, a major cardiovascular risk factor, attenuates this difference. We investigated the relationship of race and CAC in a sample of patients with type 2 diabetes without clinical CVD.\nContext 2: 589 patients (419 Caucasian, 120 South Asian, 50 other) from the PREDICT Study were investigated. All patients were asymptomatic for coronary disease and had established T2DM. CACS, lipids, lipoproteins, inflammatory markers, insulin resistance and PON1 activity, concentration and Q192R and L55M genotypes were measured. Independent associations were: 1) PON1 activity negatively with insulin resistance, triglycerides and PON1-55 genotype and positively with PON1-192 genotype; 2) PON1 concentration negatively with Caucasian ethnicity, duration of diabetes and statin use and positively with plasma creatinine and PON1-192 genotype. There was no association between CACS and any of the PON1 activity, concentration or genotype and this finding was not different in the various ethnic groups within the PREDICT study.\nContext 3: Fetuin-A has been associated with insulin resistance and inversely related with vascular calcification. The present study evaluated whether serum fetuin-A explains the ethnic disparity in the subclinical atherosclerosis and risk for diabetes between healthy Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) subjects.\nContext 4: There are pervasive racial and socioeconomic differences in health status among older adults with type 2 diabetes. The extent to which racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities unfold to differential health outcomes has yet to be investigated among older adults with diabetes. This study examines whether or not race/ethnicity and SES are independent predictors of steeper rates of decline in self-rated health among older adults in the U.S. with type 2 diabetes.\nContext 5: We performed a large case-control and family-based study to test the hypothesis that these variants are associated with type 2 diabetes in a UK Caucasian population.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does type 2 diabetes attenuate racial differences in coronary calcification??\nContext 1: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of neutrophil apoptosis. We determined the mRNA levels of pro-apoptotic Bak and anti-aptototic Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 members of the Bcl-2 family in unstimulated peripheral blood neutrophils from patients with mild to moderate COPD and compared these to neutrophils from healthy controls.\nContext 2: The percentages of apoptotic cells among unstimulated neutrophils from COPD patients were significantly lower compared to cells from controls after 4, 24, and 36 h in culture; smoking history had only a minimal effect on these differences. Unstimulated neutrophils from COPD patients had significantly lower Bak mRNA expression and higher expressions of Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNA than cells from healthy controls. Again, smoking history had only a minimal effect on these trends. Bak mRNA expression was significantly positively correlated with both % predicted FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, while Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 mRNA expressions were significantly negatively correlated with %predicted FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio.\nContext 3: Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood samples of 47 COPD patients (smokers: N\u2009=\u200924) and 47 healthy controls (smokers: N\u2009=\u200924). Percentages of apoptotic cells were determined at 4, 24, and 36 h for unstimulated neutrophils cultured in vitro. Neutrophil mRNA expression of Bak, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FEV1 (% predicted) and FVC were determined by spirometry and correlations between mRNA levels and lung function parameters were determined.\nContext 4: Neutrophilic inflammation is a major feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and several novel therapies aim at the suppression of neutrophils in COPD. Due to the abundance and redundancy of mediators involved in neutrophilic inflammation, there is an ongoing controversy about the feasibility of such anti-neutrophilic approaches. Systemic chemotherapy has broad side effects, including neutrophil toxicity.\nContext 5: Similar to COPD controls (n = 12), COPD/NSCLC patients had increased Bak mRNA expression (p < 0.05) and decreased Bcl-xl mRNA expression (p < 0.05) compared to healthy controls. In contrast to COPD controls, COPD/NSCLC patients had increased Mcl-1 mRNA expression (p < 0.05) compared to healthy controls. In COPD/NSCLC patients, Bak mRNA expression was positively correlated with % predicted FEV1 (p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with % predicted FEV1/FVC (p < 0.05). Mcl-1 mRNA expression was positively correlated with % predicted FEV1 (p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with % predicted FEV1/FVC (p", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Although the association of Helicobacter pylori (H.\u2009pylori) infection with diabetes mellitus has been evaluated, findings are controversial. This study investigated the association in a Chinese population.\nContext 2: Among a middle-age and old-age Chinese population, individuals with H.\u2009pylori infection also had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (21.3% versus 20.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.026). H.\u2009pylori infection was associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes [odds ratio, 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.14); p\u2009=\u20090.008] after adjustment for other confounders. The association was significant among women, those who were above 65 years old, not overweight or obese, and those who did not smoke, did not consume alcohol and without family history of diabetes. However, there was no interaction between H.\u2009pylori infection and other traditional risk factors on type 2 diabetes risk. Subjects with H.\u2009pylori infection had a lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and higher levels of blood pressure (p\u2009<\u20090.001), total cholesterol, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) than those who did not.\nContext 3: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a chronic stomach infection common throughout the world. The pediatric diabetes literature on the relation between Hp and HbA1c is sparse and controversial. This study aimed to investigate this relation.\nContext 4: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are often affected by chronic infections; however, antibiotic absorption may be influenced by the disease. Helicobacter pylori, the most common gastric infection worldwide, is the main acquired factor in the pathogenesis of gastritis and peptic ulcer. The aim of the study was to compare the H. pylori eradication rate obtained with a standard 7-day antibiotic regimen in a group of IDDM H. pylori infected patients and in a control group of infected dyspeptic patients.\nContext 5: Gastric Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and colorectal polyps are more prevalent in African Americans than in the general population. We aimed to investigate whether gastric H. pylori infection is associated with colorectal polyps in African Americans.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and the risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and the risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and the risk of gastric cancer in a Chinese population.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) consists of demyelination and neuronal injury, which occur early in the disease; yet, remission phases indicate repair. Whether and how the central nervous system (CNS) maintains homeostasis to counteract clinical impairment is not known. The descriptions of early axonal damage in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) prompted the search of body fluid markers. However, the studies addressing this issue in MS present conflicting results. There is an increasing body of evidence that magnetic resonance imaging-occult tissue damage is an important component of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) pathology.

We determined whether outcomes after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) differ between stage T1a and T1b subcategories.\nContext 3: The population included a selected group of 43 patients presenting T1 bladder tumors with no carcinoma in situ (Tis), treated by transurethral resection (TUR) followed by intravesical BCG therapy. Clinical outcome was analyzed in relation to usual clinical and histopathological parameters, and pretreatment p53 tumor status was assayed by an immunohistochemical technique using DO7 monoclonal antibody. For 16 specimens, p53 gene was investigated using a Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and sequence determination.\nContext 4: In superficial urothelial tumors of the bladder, p53 status is currently the most informative pretreatment parameter to define a population at higher risk for invasive carcinoma. Also, in T1 tumors, occurrence of muscular invasion is often related to an early relapse following BCG therapy. With the knowledge of biological parameters able to identify the group of initial BCG therapy non-responders, it would be possible to offer earlier treatment to the patients who need a more aggressive mode of therapy. The aim of this work was to study the predictive value of the p53 tumor status on the early BCG therapy response.\nContext 5: Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin is the standard treatment for patients with nonmuscle invasive high histological grade bladder cancer. Previously we found that bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin induces murine bladder cancer MB49 cell death in vitro and in vivo, generating tissue remodeling, which involves the release of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a clear and concise answer to the question below.\nThe aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of p53 and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) expression in patients with stage T1 grade 3 (T1G3) bladder cancer (BC) treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) and intravesical instillations of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).\nSubstaging of T1 bladder tumors into T1a and T1b based on invasion of the tumor superficial to and beyond the muscularis mucosa has been assigned prognostic significance.

Temperatures were obtained with a temporal scanner and with an ingestible-pill telemetry system that tracks intestinal temperature. Temperatures were recorded while subjects were normothermic (34 degrees C water-perfusing suit) and every 10 min during passive heating (48 degrees C water-perfusing suit).\nContext 3: Heart rate (ECG), mean skin temperature (weighted six-site average), skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), and sweat rate (capacitance hygrometry) were all significantly elevated at the end of heating (all P < 0.001). Pre-heat stress temporal-derived temperature was not different from intestinal temperature (36.98 +/- 0.09 vs 37.01 +/- 0.09 degrees C, respectively, P = 0.76). However, after 30 min of heating (the greatest duration of heating completed by all subjects), temporal-derived temperature decreased to below the pre-heat stress baseline (-0.22 +/- 0.11), whereas intestinal temperature increased by 0.39 +/- 0.07 degrees C (P < 0.001 between the two methods). After 50 min of heating (N = 11), intestinal-derived internal temperature increased by 0.70 +/- 0.09 degrees C, whereas temporal-derived temperature decreased by 0.29 +/- 0.10 degrees C (P < 0.001). The group average (+/- SEM) R2 and slope between the two methods were 0.29 +/- 0.08 and -0.34 +/- 0.14, respectively.\nContext 4: Exertional heat stroke is a cause of collapse in marathon runners. Rectal temperature (T(rectal)) measurement is the usual method of estimating core temperature in collapsed runners, and temporal artery thermometer (TAT) measurement is untested for field use in marathon runners and other athletes. The objective of this study is to compare TAT measurement with T(rectal) measurement in collapsed marathon runners.\nContext 5: A small but statistically significant reduction of peak work capacity was observed in the heat stress versus temperate conditions (253\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030 and 259\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0mW, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). The TAT was significantly lower than T(rectal) in the heat stress (37.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 degrees C) and temperate conditions (37.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 degrees C) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

In addition, high expression of inflammatory markers is associated with worse prognosis of coronary artery disease. The presence and extent of inducible ischemia in patients with stable angina has previously been shown to have strong prognostic value. We hypothesized that evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia by local lesions, as measured by fractional flow reserve (FFR), is associated with increased levels of blood based inflammatory biomarkers.\nContext 2: Invasive physiologic assessment and VH-IVUS were performed and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured in 51 patients with non-obstructive CAD [fractional flow\u00a0reserve (FFR)\u22650.75]. Microvascular dysfunction was defined as coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR)<2.0. Lumen area and plaque burden and composition were assessed in each VH-IVUS frame. Frequency of thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) in each artery was defined as the percentage of VH-IVUS frames with plaque burden\u226540% and confluent necrotic core\u226510% in contact with lumen for at least 3 consecutive frames.\nContext 3: Two hundred consecutive patients undergoing fractional flow reserve (FFR) testing of an intermediate coronary lesion with a pressure wire and intravenous infusion of adenosine were studied. Coronary calcium was quantified based upon radiopacities at the site of the stenosis on cineangiography using the method of Mintz et al. (0\u2009=\u2009none or mild calcium, 1\u2009=\u2009moderate calcium, 2\u2009=\u2009severe calcium).\nContext 4: To demonstrate that fractional flow reserve (FFR) of vessels in patients with high left ventricular mass index (LVMI) should be similar to that of matched vessels in patients with normal LVMI.\nContext 5: Inflammatory markers may serve as an important prognostic predictor in patients with coronary heart diseases. In patients undergoing coronary interventions, it has been shown that baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) could predict late clinical restenosis. Only a few small studies have examined the possible relationship with angiographic restenosis. In patients with stable angina pectoris,we examined whether baseline CRP and IL-6 predict late coronary angiographic restenosis after stenting.\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia by local lesions, as measured by FFR, is associated with increased levels of blood based inflammatory biomarkers. In addition, the presence of inducible myocardial ischemia by local lesions, as measured by FFR, is associated with increased levels of blood based inflammatory biomarkers.

The long-term effects of coffee consumption on the metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components are unknown. This study investigated the relationship of long-term coffee consumption between the age of 27 and 36 years with the prevalence of the MS at the age of 36 years.\nContext 2: At the age of 36 years, the prevalence of the MS was 10.1%. The growth of coffee consumption did not differ significantly between subjects with or without the MS or its components. Regression analyses showed that one cup day(-1) higher coffee consumption was related to 0.11 mm Hg lower mean arterial blood pressure (P=0.03), 0.02 mg 100 ml(-1) higher triglyceride level (P=0.57), 0.04 mg 100 ml(-1) higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P=0.35), 0.09% higher HbA(1c) (P=0.12) and 0.02 cm larger waist circumference (P=0.57). After adjustment for physical activity, energy intake, smoking behaviour and alcohol consumption, none of the relationships between coffee consumption and the MS or its components was significant.\nContext 3: Data on coffee consumption and the MS components were derived from a healthy sample of 174 men and 194 women followed up from the age of 27 years onwards. Data analysis was performed with the use of generalized estimating equations and regression analysis.\nContext 4: We ascertained 4,311 and 2,730 incident AF cases in men and women, respectively, in the two cohorts. Coffee consumption was not associated with AF incidence in these cohort studies. The lack of association was confirmed in a meta-analysis, including six cohort studies with a total of 10,406 cases of AF diagnosed among 248,910 individuals. The overall relative risk (95% confidence interval) of AF was 0.96 (0.84-1.08) for the highest versus lowest category of coffee consumption, and 0.99 (0.94-1.03) per 2 cups/day increment of coffee consumption.\nContext 5: The Penn State Young Women's Health Study is a longitudinal investigation of bone, endocrine and cardiovascular health in non-Hispanic, white, teenage women.

Two studies of Asian populations have reported that GSTM1*0 \u2044 *0 (null) genotype was a likely predictor of hepatotoxicity, whereas another of a Caucasian population implicated GSTT1*0 \u2044 *0. We undertook a prospective case-control study to investigate whether GSTM*0 \u2044 *0 and GSTT1*0 \u2044 *0 were risk factors for ATD-induced hepatotoxicity.\nContext 2: Pulmonary tuberculosis patients on isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide who developed hepatotoxicity using defined criteria were prospectively identified. These cases were then matched with at least one control subject on the same drugs but without hepatotoxicity. Genotyping for GSTM1 and GSTT1 was performed by multiplex PCR on genomic DNA. The odds ratios for the frequency of specific GSTM1 and GSTT1 homozygotes in the case and control subjects were calculated to test for association between the genotypes and hepatotoxicity.\nContext 3: The general view on the pathogenesis of drug-induced idiosyncratic liver injury (DILI) is that parent compounds are rendered hepatotoxic by metabolism, mainly by cytochrome (CYP) 450, although other metabolic pathways can contribute. Anecdotal reports suggest a role of CYP 450 polymorphisms in DILI. We aimed to assess in a series of Spanish DILI patients the prevalence of important allelic variants of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, known to be involved in the metabolism of several hepatotoxic drugs.\nContext 4: Severe toxicity is commonly observed in cancer patients receiving irinotecan. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) catalyzes the glucuronidation of the active metabolite SN-38. This study prospectively evaluated the association between the prevalence of severe toxicity and UGT1A1 genetic variation.\nContext 5: Nineteen patients were included. Median duration of 6-thioguanine therapy (median daily dosage 21 mg (9-24)) was 23 weeks (6-96). Hepatotoxicity did not reoccur during the follow-up period. The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity was 3 weeks (1-6). The median time to recovery was 3 weeks (1-6). The median time to recovery was 3 weeks (1-6).

An association of a methionine-to-valine polymorphism (rs237025, 163A --> G, M55V) in the SUMO4 gene within IDDM5 has recently been described in T1D. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that SUMO4 is a general autoimmune susceptibility gene by investigating whether the SUMO4 polymorphism is associated with RA and/or JIA.\nContext 2: To replicate the association reported in Japanese individuals of functional SLC22A4 and RUNX1 polymorphisms with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to test the possible role in this trait of a functional variant of the SUMO4 gene that was shown to be associated with another related autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes (T1D).\nContext 3: A previous study has shown that rs548234 polymorphism at PRDM1-ATG5 region is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Caucasian populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rs548234 polymorphism at PRDM1-ATG5 region on susceptibility to RA in Chinese Han population.\nContext 4: Several rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility loci have also been found to be associated with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), demonstrating that there is a degree of genetic overlap between various autoimmune diseases. We sought to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to previously reported RA and/or PsA susceptibility loci, including PLCL2, CCL21, REL, STAT4, CD226, PTPN22, and TYK2, are associated with risk for the two diseases in a genetically homogeneous Greek population.\nContext 5: We selected 46 variants: (1) eight variants known to alter circulating levels of inflammatory proteins, including those in the IL18, IL1RN, IL6R, MIF, PAI1 (also known as SERPINE1) and CRP genes; and (2) 38 variants known to predispose to autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. We tested the associations of these variants with type 2 diabetes using a meta-analysis of 4,107 cases and 4,107 controls from 11 studies.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs1049093 polymorphism in the SUMO4 gene with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Chinese Han population.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs1049093 polymorphism in the SUMO4 gene with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Chinese Han population.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs1049093 polymorphism in the SUMO4 gene with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Chinese Han population.\nContext 9:", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) suggests a direct cellular insult to myocardium. Apoptosis is considered as one of the hallmarks of DCM. Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DCM. In this study, we explored the prevention of myocardial apoptosis by crude extract from Flos Puerariae (FPE) in experimental diabetic mice.\nContext 2: Experimental diabetic model was induced by intraperitoneally injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg/day) for five consecutive days in C57BL/6J mice. FPE (100, 200 mg/kg) was orally administrated once a day for ten weeks. Cardiac structure changes, apoptosis, superoxide production, NADPH oxidase subunits expression (gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox), and related regulatory factors were assessed in the heart of mice.\nContext 3: Increased myocyte apoptosis in diabetic hearts has been previously reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise training on cardiac survival pathways in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nContext 4: Diabetic mice were characterized by high blood glucose (\u226511.1 mmol/L) and reduced body weight. In the end of the experiment, aberrant myofilament structure, as well as TUNEL positive cardiac cells coupled with increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3 expression was found in diabetic mice. Moreover, ROS formation, the ratio of NADP+/NADPH and NADPH oxidase subunits expression of gp91phox and p47phox, lipid peroxidation level was significantly increased, while antioxidant enzyme SOD and GSH-Px activity were reduced in the myocardial tissue of diabetic mice. In contrast, treatment with FPE resulted in a normalized glucose and weight profile. FPE administration also preserved myocardial structure and reduced apoptotic cardiac cell death in diabetic mice. The elevated markers of oxidative stress were significantly reversed by FPE supplementation. Further, FPE treatment markedly inhibited the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and Caspase-3 expression, as well as suppressed JNK and P38 MAPK activation in the heart of diabetic mice.\nContext 5: To investigate the effects of icariin on cardiac functions and mitochondrial oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nContext 6: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of icariin on cardiac functions and mitochondrial oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nContext 7: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of icariin on cardiac functions and mitochondrial oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nContext 8: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of icariin on cardiac functions and mitochondrial oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.\nContext 9: The present study was designed to investigate the effects of icariin on cardiac functions and mitochondrial oxidative stress in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We observed the first meiotic cells at 11 wpf, when STRA8, SPO11 and DMC1 are first expressed. In culture, meiosis initiation is observed in 10 and 11 wpf ovaries and meiosis is maintained by addition of fetal calf serum. Meiosis is stimulated, compared with control, by retinoic acid (RA) (P < 0.05). No major change occurred in mRNA for CYP26B1, the RA-degrading enzyme proposed to control the timing of meiosis in mice. We did, however, observe increased mRNA levels for ALDH1A1 in human ovary when meiosis began, and evidence for a requirement to synthesize RA and thus sustain meiosis. Indeed, ALDH inhibition by citral prevented the appearance of meiotic cells. Finally, 8 wpf ovaries (and earlier stages) were unable to initiate meiosis whatever the length of culture, even in the presence of RA and serum. However, when human germ cells from 8 wpf ovaries were placed in a mouse ovarian environment, some did initiate meiosis.\nContext 2: The initiation of meiosis is crucial to fertility. While extensive studies in rodents have enhanced our understanding of this process, studies in human fetal ovary are lacking.\nContext 3: The retinoic acid metabolizing enzyme Cyp26a1 plays a pivotal role in vertebrate embryo development. Cyp26a1 was characterized previously as a differentially expressed gene in peri-implantation rat uteri via suppressive subtracted hybridization analysis. However, the role of Cyp26a1 in rat embryo implantation remained elusive.\nContext 4: Adult female rhesus macaques were stimulated to develop multiple preovulatory follicles by administering human recombinant gonadotropins, and oocytes were collected by follicle aspiration 36 h after an ovulatory stimulus (human chorionic gonadotropin). Monkeys received no further treatment (controls) or the PDE3 inhibitor cilostazol at the maximum approved human dose of 100mg twice daily starting 6 days prior to follicle aspiration. Recovered oocytes were scored for meiotic stage [germinal vesicle (GV) intact, GV breakdown], and metaphase II stage oocytes were fertilized in vitro and observed for normal embryo development.\nContext 5: We used RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to investigate expression of the retinoic acid metabolizing enzyme Cyp26a1 in the human ovary. We also used immunohistochemistry to investigate expression of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) in the human ovary. We found that Cyp26a1 mRNA was expressed in the human ovary, and that Cyp26a1 protein was expressed in the granulosa cells of the preovulatory follicle. We also found that RARalpha mRNA was expressed in the granulosa cells of the preovulatory follicle. We conclude that Cyp26a1 is expressed in the human ovary and that RARalpha is expressed in the granulosa cells of the preovulatory follicle.\nContext", "Question: Do diffusion-weighted 3D multislab echo planar imaging for high signal-to-noise ratio efficiency and isotropic image resolution??\nExplanation: The purpose of this study was to seek improved image quality from accelerated echo planar imaging (EPI) data, particularly at ultrahigh fields. Certain artifacts in EPI reconstructions can be attributed to nonlinear phase differences between data acquired using frequency-encoding gradients of alternating polarity. These errors appear near regions of local susceptibility gradients and typically cannot be corrected with conventional Nyquist ghost correction (NGC) methods. To evaluate the feasibility of a magnetic resonance imaging protocol for the lung using a volumetric interpolated 3D-gradient echo sequence (3D-GRE), we acquired 3D-G", "Question: Does [ Sildenafil change coronary flow reserve in diabetics with erectile dysfunction ]?\nExplanation: Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that is used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is a vasodilator that relaxes the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, allowing for increased blood flow to the penis. Sildenafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes. Erectile dysfunction is a common complication of diabetes. It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Sildenafil has been shown to improve erectile function in men with diabetes. It is not known whether sildenafil improves coronary flow reserve in men with diabetes. Coronary flow reserve is a measure of the ability of the coronary circulation to deliver blood to", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The increased cardiovascular (CV) disease risk in patients with morbid obesity (MO) cannot be fully explained by traditional CV risk factors. Activation of the receptor of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) leads to inflammation via the NF \u03ba\u03b2 (nuclear factor \u03ba\u03b2) pathway. The soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE), which is present in plasma, can bind to ligands of RAGE and avoids interaction of RAGE with proinflammatory ligands. We investigated sRAGE levels in patients with MO and compared them with healthy lean controls (CO), before and after bariatric surgery.\nContext 2: In addition to weight loss, bariatric surgery for severe obesity dramatically alleviates insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated whether circulating concentrations of the high-molecular-weight (HMW) form of adiponectin are increased following gastric bypass surgery. The HMW form is implicated as the multimer responsible for adiponectin's hepatic insulin-sensitising actions.\nContext 3: Eight lean women during hysterectomy (controls) and 19 severely obese women during bariatric surgery were studied, 8 without metabolic syndrome (OM- group) and 11 with it (OM+ group). Biopsies of omental and subcutaneous fat were performed in the severely obese women during surgery, but only omental biopsies in the controls. Expression of 11\u03b2-HSD1, glucocorticoid receptor \u03b1 (GR\u03b1) and glucocorticoid receptor \u03b2 (GR\u03b2) was evaluated using real-time PCR.\nContext 4: Thirty-two morbidly obese patients were divided by the absence (\"healthy\": DM-DL-) or presence of comorbidities (dyslipidemic: DM-DL+, or dyslipidemic and with type 2 diabetes: DM+DL+). We have studied various plasma parameters and gene expression adipose tissue, before and after gastric bypass.\nContext 5: Metformin action was assessed in Glp1r(-/-), Gipr(-/-), Glp1r:Gipr(-/-), Ppar\u03b1 (also known as Ppara)(-/-) and hyperglycaemic obese wild-type mice with or without the GLP-1 receptor (GLP1R) antagonist exendin(9-39). Experimental endpoints included glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels, gastric emptying and food intake. Incretin receptor expression was assessed in the duodenum and in the liver.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bariatric surgery on the expression of the genes encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the liver and adipose tissue of morbidly obese patients.

Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful; however, resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority. We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia (WEV) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles (WEV+NPs) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells.\nContext 2: Increasing environmental and occupational exposures to nanoparticles (NPs) warrant deeper insight into the toxicological mechanisms induced by these materials. The present study was designed to characterize the cell death induced by carbon black (CB) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs in bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o- cell line and primary cells) and to investigate the implicated molecular pathways.\nContext 3: Several studies have reported adverse immunological effects of silicone due to their ability to induce proinflammatory molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In recent years, use of nanoparticles has been under fast development for therapeutic drug targeting, diagnostic imaging, and immune response in various fields of nanomedicine. The authors hypothesize that immune responses induced by in vivo use of silicone materials can be reduced or eliminated by the use of nanosilicone.\nContext 4: We investigate the role of ZA on the myeloid differentiation to TAMs in murine mesothelioma in vivo and in vitro. Mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with a lethal dose of mesothelioma tumour cells and treated with ZA to determine the effects on myeloid differentiation and survival.\nContext 5: Silicone nanoparticles up to 100 \u03bcg/ml did not induce any detectable levels of specific TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6 gene expression and protein production and the results were comparable to those for untreated controls. Silicone microparticles at 100 \u03bcg/ml, however, significantly induced the production and gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. XTT viability assay showed that silicone nanoparticles at 100 \u03bcg/ml significantly inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The results suggest that silicone nanoparticles may be a potential immunosuppressive agent.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) on the proliferation and apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to determine the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that SiO2 NPs significantly inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The results also showed that the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was significantly increased, while the expression of Bcl-xL and caspase-3 was significantly", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To relate QT parameters to infarct size and inducibility during electrophysiological studies.\nContext 2: Mean (SD) QT parameters were: QT-max 440 (50) ms, QTc-max 475 (46) ms, and QT-d 47 (20) ms. Mean (SD) estimates of infarct size were: LVEF 34 (13)%, LVEDD 61 (9) mm, and defect score 18 (11). There was no significant correlation between any index of infarct size and QT parameters. QT parameters were not significantly different between patients with inducible (n = 57) and non-inducible arrhythmias (n = 7) (QT-max: 416 (30) v 443 (51) ms, p = 0.18; QTc-max 485 (34) v 473 (47) ms, p = 0.34; QT-d 47 (12) v 47 (21) ms, p = 0.73). Non-inducible patients had a significant lower defect score: 8 (9) v 19 (11), p = 0.02, but comparable LVEF: 38 (12)% v 34 (12)%, p = 0.58, and LVEDD: 54 (10) v 61 (8) mm, p = 0.13.\nContext 3: Measurements of QT-max, QTc-max, and QT dispersion (QT-d) on a simultaneous 12 lead ECG (50 mm/s).

Electrophysiological study to assess inducibility.\nContext 4: QT dispersion (QTd, range of QT intervals in 12 ECG leads) is thought to reflect spatial heterogeneity of ventricular refractoriness. However, QTd may be largely due to projections of the repolarization dipole rather than \"nondipolar\" signals.\nContext 5: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been shown to be a significant cause of death after heart transplantation. QT dispersion (QTd) is associated with SCD in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). QTd is also associated with SCD in patients with ICM. QTd is not associated with SCD in patients with DCM.\nContext 6: QTd is a measure of ventricular repolarization heterogeneity. QTd is a measure of ventricular repolarization heterogeneity.

Desmopressin reduces blood loss in adult patients with excessive bleeding after cardiac operation. Its usefulness in patients undergoing complex congenital heart repair with cardiopulmonary bypass is unproved.\nContext 2: Sixty patients younger than 40 years of age scheduled for complex congenital heart operation (44 redo, 16 primary) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Desmopressin 0.3 microg/kg or placebo was administered 10 minutes after protamine administration. Transfusion requirements and postoperative blood loss were recorded. Differences were analyzed using analysis of variance with a p value of 0.05 or less used to denote statistical significance.\nContext 3: Patients undergoing major cardiothoracic surgery are subjected to dilution, owing to massive fluid infusion and blood component transfusion. These patients may experience bleeding perioperatively, and are frequently treated with the endothelium-activating agent desmopressin.\nContext 4: Cumulative chest tube drainage up to 16 h and total transfusion requirements did not differ between the groups. Using a platelet transfusion trigger of 100x10(9)/l, significantly more patients received platelets during the immediate recovery period in the algorithm group than in the control group (14 vs. 3 patients, P=0.001). Desmopressin acetate was administered more often in group A than in group B (8 vs. 2 patients, P=0.04).\nContext 5: The synthetic vasopressin analog desmopressin has hemostatic properties and may reduce postoperative bleeding after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A study on the effects of recent aspirin ingestion on platelet function in cardiac surgery showed a greater impairment of platelet function in patients treated with aspirin <2 days before the operation. We evaluated the effects of desmopressin on postoperative bleeding in CABG patients who were treated with aspirin 75 or 160 mg until the day before surgery. The study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. One-hundred patients were included and divided into two groups. One group received desmopressin 0.3 microg/kg and the other group received placebo. The primary outcome was the amount of blood loss during the first 24 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the amount of blood loss during the first 24 h after surgery and the amount of blood loss during the first 24 h after surgery. The amount of blood loss during the first 24 h after surgery was significantly lower in the desmopressin group than in the placebo group (P=0.001). The amount of blood loss during the first 24 h after surgery was significantly lower in the desmopressin group than in the placebo group (P=0.001).

We aimed to evaluate the effects of the variants in KCNQ1 on type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits in the population of mainland China.\nContext 2: We confirmed the association of KCNQ1 with type 2 diabetes in the population of mainland China. Allele frequency ORs of the three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were: rs2237892 (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31, p = 3.0 x 10(-4)); rs2237895 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.32, p = 1.9 x 10(-4)); and rs2237897 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36, p = 3.9 x 10(-5)). We also found a significant difference in the distribution of the global haplotypes between the type 2 diabetes group and the normal control group (p = 2.6 x 10(-5)). In addition, in the control group SNP rs2237892 was marginally associated with increasing fasting plasma glucose and SNPs rs2237892 and rs2237897 were associated with HbA(1c). Furthermore, for all three variants, homozygous carriers of the diabetes-associated allele had significantly decreased BMI and waist circumferences.\nContext 3: The six variants initially reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes were less common in Pima Indians compared with samples of European origin, and none were associated with type 2 diabetes. One representative variant, rs1225404, was nominally associated with type 2 diabetes in a general model (additive P = 0.03, dominant P = 0.005) but not in a within-family analysis (additive P = 0.2, dominant P = 0.07). However, several variants were associated with BMI; in particular, rs12255372 was associated in both general and within-family analyses (both P = 0.0007). Modest associations were also found with traits predictive for type 2 diabetes.\nContext 4: Three independent genome-wide association studies in white populations have reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KCNQ1 are associated with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to replicate these findings in a Chinese population.\nContext 5: We confirmed the association of KCNQ1 with type 2 diabetes in the population of mainland China.

The objective of this study was to determine the association between the time from bite to initial antivenom administration (Time(AV)) and the total amount of antivenom administered (Total(AV)) and to determine what proportion of patients did not have progression of the envenomation syndrome and did not receive antivenom.\nContext 2: We retrospectively reviewed the records of the Japan Snake Institute between January 1, 1973 and December 31, 2013. Antivenom and without antivenom groups were compared with regard to baseline demographic features, treatment-related factors, and outcomes.\nContext 3: This was a retrospective chart review of patients presenting with crotaline snakebite within 24 hours from 2009 through 2012. Blinded dual-chart abstraction and strict data point definitions were used. Spearman correlation was used to determine the association between Time(AV) and Total(AV). A general linear model was used to examine this association using Time(AV) categorized to early and late administration, adjusted for likely confounders. Confounders included age, extremity involved, initial severity, and year of envenomation.\nContext 4: Of the patients bitten by rattlesnakes, 81% were men, and 79% of bites were on the upper extremities. Fifty-five percent of bites were provoked by the patient, and 44% were unprovoked. Neither location of snakebite nor provocation of snakebite affected the SSS. Only 1 patient had a snakebite without envenomation, and only 1 patient died from envenomation. Rattlesnake size was positively correlated with SSS, and SSS was positively correlated with the number of vials of antivenom used and with the length of hospital stay. Rattlesnake species and patient mass did not affect SSS.\nContext 5: We retrospectively reviewed 145 charts of patients bitten by rattlesnakes in Southern California between 1995 and 2004, measuring Snakebite Severity Scores (SSS) and characteristics of envenomation that might be correlated with snakebite severity, including rattlesnake size, rattlesnake species, patient size, and anatomic location of the bite.

Outcomes measured included mortality,", "Question: Do repeated stressors in adulthood increase the rate of biological ageing??\nExplanation: The answer is no. The results of this study suggest that repeated stressors in adulthood do not increase the rate of biological ageing. The authors found that repeated stressors in adulthood did not increase the rate of telomere shortening, oxidative stress load, or glucocorticoid hormones. This suggests that repeated stressors in adulthood do not increase the rate of biological ageing.

To date, efforts to differentiate those who will progress to dementia from those who will not have proved inconclusive, and while grades of risk have been identified, their generalizability is not clear.\nContext 2: A statistically significant P600 congruous word repetition effect was found only in the nonconverter group (F = 9.9, p = 0.005 vs MCI converters). This effect correlated with verbal memory measures. Repetition of incongruous words produced a significant N400 amplitude attenuation (across right-hemisphere sites) in nonconverters, but not in converters. Patients with MCI with abnormal/reduced N400 or P600 word repetition effects had an 87 to 88% likelihood of dementia within 3 years while those with normal/spared N400 and P600 repetition effects had only an 11 to 27% likelihood.\nContext 3: Individuals with MCI were more likely than controls to have a systolic BP (SBP) deficit of greater than 30% 30 seconds after standing (P =.01). Thirty percent of participants with MCI (n = 43) converted to dementia within the 3-year follow-up period. Individuals with MCI with a SBP deficit greater than 30% 30 seconds after standing were twice as likely to convert to dementia as those without the deficit (HR = 2.77, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-7.50).\nContext 4: Mild Cognitive Impairment defines a transitional stage between normal ageing and dementia, and reflects the clinical situation where a person has memory complaints and objective evidence of cognitive impairment but no evidence of dementia. To plan the care of patients with MCI, it is important to predict as accurately as possible potential risk factors modulating the conversion to AD.\nContext 5: 25(OH)D level was not different between the cognitively normal (n = 200), MCI (n = 46), and demented (n = 182) patients nor between the different etiologies of dementia. In polytomous logistic regression, the 25(OH)D level neither as a continuous variable nor as a categorical variable increased the risk to be MCI or demented. The 25(OH)D level did not predict conversion from normal or MCI to dementia.\nContext 6: The 25(OH)D level was not associated with the risk of conversion from normal to MCI or MCI to dementia. The 25(OH)D level was not associated with the risk of conversion from MCI to dementia.\nContext 7: The 25(OH)D level was not associated with the risk of conversion from normal to MCI or MCI to dementia.

Currently, no previous study explored the role of Th22 cells in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study aimed to determine the biological function of Th22 cells and its effector IL-22 in HCC patients.\nContext 2: Circulating Th22 cells, Th17 cells and serum IL-22 levels were significantly elevated in HCC patients compared with those of healthy controls (P<0.001). Th22 cells were showed to be positively correlated with IL-22 in HCC patients (P<0.05), but not in healthy controls. No significant differences were found in HCC patients with HBeAg positivity or negativity in term of Th22 cells and serum IL-22 levels. The expression of IL-22 protein and mRNA was highest in HCC tissues, followed by adjacent HCC tissues and normal liver tissues. Furthermore, Th22 cells, serum IL-22 levels and IL-22 mRNA were elevated at stage III-IV compared with stage I-II of HCC (P<0.05).\nContext 3: The 5-year survival rate of patients with\u00a0hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was very low because of invasion and metastasis in the early stage. Biomarkers might help predict early occurrence of invasion and metastasis. Accumulating evidence has shown that deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC1) may be considered as a metastasis suppressor gene in numerous solid and hematological cancers.\u00a0However, its prognostic role and mechanisms that regulate and coordinate these activities remain poorly understood.\nContext 4: Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF)-related proteins (HRPs) comprise a family of six members and are characterised by a conserved HATH domain. Among the family members, HDGF was the first to be identified as a mitogenic factor and shown to play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. The aim of the present study is to examine the relevance of HDGF-related protein-3 (HRP-3), another member of the HRP family in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nContext 5: We investigated the relation between UNC50 and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the potential mechanisms underlying HCC development.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe or not applicable (N/A) format.\n\nThe study aimed to determine the biological function of Th22 cells and its effector IL-22 in HCC patients.\n\nTh22 cells were showed to be positively correlated with IL-22 in HCC patients (P<0.05), but not in healthy controls.

Pharmacological blockade of downstream phosphatidylinositide signaling disrupted the behavioral antidepressant effects in rats. However, the nucleolipid responses were resistant to inhibition by serotonin receptor antagonists, even though antidepressant-facilitated inositol phosphate accumulation was blocked. Could the neurochemical effects be additional to the known effects of the drugs on monoamine transmitter transporters? To examine this question, we tested selected agents in serotonin-depleted brain tissues, in PC12 cells devoid of serotonin transporters, and on the enzymatic activity of brain CDP-diacylglycerol synthase - the enzyme that catalyzes the physiological synthesis of CDP-diacylglycerol.\nContext 2: Imipramine, paroxetine, and maprotiline concentration-dependently increased the levels of CDP-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylinositides in PC12 cells. Rat forebrain tissues depleted of serotonin by pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine showed responses to imipramine or maprotiline that were comparable to respective responses from saline-injected controls. With fluoxetine, nucleolipid responses in the serotonin-depleted cortex or hippocampus were significantly reduced, but not abolished. Each drug significantly increased the enzymatic activity of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase following incubations with cortical or hippocampal brain tissues.\nContext 3: As many as 30% of individuals diagnosed with depression are nonresponsive to traditional antidepressant medication. Augmentation and combination strategies have emerged in an attempt to address this issue. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine), when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine) have shown great promise in the treatment of these treatment-resistant patients. As of yet, the precise neural mechanisms responsible for the beneficial clinical effect of these combinations are not completely understood.\nContext 4: Increasing concentrations of isoflurane produced the expected dose-dependent cardiovascular depression, but this was not altered by cocaine exposure.\nContext 5: Several evidences implicate that monoamines play a modulatory role in the brain mechanisms underlying encoding and retrieval of emotional memories. Recent experiments demonstrate that acute monoaminergic potentiation with the antidepressants bupropion and fluoxetine enhances the retrieval of emotional memories. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute monoaminergic potentiation on the retrieval of emotional memories in rats. We found that acute monoaminergic potentiation with bupropion and fluoxetine enhanced the retrieval of emotional memories in rats. The enhancement of retrieval was blocked by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, but not by the selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor bupropion. The enhancement of retrieval was also blocked by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, but not by the selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor bupropion.

We also tested whether the CpG island mapping PTTG1 proximal promoter evidenced a differential methylation pattern in differentiated thyroid cancer biopsies concordant to their PTTG1 immunohistochemistry status. Finally, we performed whole-genome LOH studies using Affymetix 50 K microarray technology and FRET analysis to search for allelic imbalances comprising the PTTG1 locus.\nContext 2: Majority of CpG dinucleotides in mammalian genomes tend to undergo DNA methylation, but most CpG islands are resistant to such epigenetic modification. Understanding about mechanisms that may lead to the methylation resistance of CpG islands is still very poor.\nContext 3: We identified 621 CpG sites located in promoter regions and CpG islands that were greatly hypermethylated in CRC compared to normal mucosa. The genes on chromosome 18 showed promoter hypermethylation most frequently. According to gene ontology analysis, the most common biologically relevant class of genes affected by methylation was the class associated with the cadherin signaling pathway. Compared to the genome-wide expression array, mRNA expression was more likely to be downregulated in the genes demonstrating promoter hypermethylation, even though this was not statistically significant. We validated ten CpG sites that were hypermethylated (ADHFE1, BOLL, SLC6A15, ADAMTS5, TFPI2, EYA4, NPY, TWIST1, LAMA1, GAS7) and 2 CpG sites showing hypomethylation (MAEL, SFT2D3) in CRC compared to the normal mucosa in the array studies using pyrosequencing. The methylation status measured by pyrosequencing was consistent with the methylation array data.\nContext 4: Methylphenidate significantly improved performance of both PASAT3'' and PASAT2'' tests by 22.8% and 25.6% respectively (p<0.001), while no significant changes were observed in placebo treated patients.\nContext 5: We have made a detailed examination of somatic methylation of the IAP using bisulphite allelic sequencing, and find that the promoter is incompletely methylated in 10% of the cases.

A deletion polymorphism of a 287-bp fragment of intron 16 of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene allele results in higher levels of circulating enzyme. ACE deletion genotype has been linked to heart diseases, sarcoidosis and liver fibrosis. The pancreatic renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the development of pancreatic fibrosis and ACE inhibitors decrease pancreatic fibrosis in experimental models. Therefore, ACE deletion genotype may be a genetic marker of the risk of SSc.

Differential cell counts, elastase activities, and desmosine and hydroxyproline in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid were determined. Immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis determined the cell origin of macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12). Anti-neutrophil antibody was applied to assess the contribution of elastase in ufCB induced lung destruction.\nContext 2: We aimed to evaluate whether ultrafine particle exposure causes the infiltration of inflammatory and dendritic cells (DCs) with increased elastase activity, contributing to lung parenchymal destruction.\nContext 3: Titanium dioxide (TiO\u2082) and carbon black (CB) nanoparticles (NPs) have biological effects that could aggravate pulmonary emphysema. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pulmonary administration of TiO\u2082 or CB NPs in rats could induce and/or aggravate elastase-induced emphysema, and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.\nContext 4: ufCB exposure led to significant increases in neutrophils, mononuclear cells and total proteins in BAL fluid. Desmosine and hydroxyproline were significantly increased in the ufCB group. Elastase activities were found to be significantly elevated, with both neutrophil elastase and MMP-12 peaking at 3 d post-exposure. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that pulmonary infiltrations of MMP-12 positive DCs, including Langerhans cells-derived DCs, occurred at 3 d and 7 d, while macrophage infiltration was obvious starting at 1 d. Anti-neutrophil antibody significantly reduced neutrophil elastase activity and prevented the increases in BAL desmosine and hydroxyproline following ufCB exposure.\nContext 5: C-reactive protein (CRP), a prototypical acute phase protein, is increased as much as 1000-fold during acute inflammation, suggesting its biological role in that process. CRP can be modified at sites of inflammation where proteases have been released by neutrophils migrating to tissues. In this study, we investigated whether native CRP and neutrophil elastase-digested products of CRP modulate the rate of elastase-induced emphysema in rats.\nContext 6: We hypothesized that CRP and elastase-digested CRP could modulate elastase-induced emphysema in rats.\nContext 7: We aimed to investigate whether CRP and elastase-digested CRP could modulate elastase-induced emphysema in rats.\nContext 8: We hypothesized that CRP and elastase-digested CRP could modulate elastase-induced emphysema in rats.\nContext 9: We hypothesized that CRP and elastase-digested CRP could modulate elastase-induced emphysema in rats.\nContext 10: We hypothesized that CRP and elastase-dig", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To evaluate the expression level of RIP140 (receptor interaction protein 140) and its correlation with inflammatory cytokine production and free fatty acids (FFAs) in type 2 diabetes.\nContext 2: TG, LDL-C, FIN, FBG, HOMA, and HDL-C were significantly different between diabetic patients and the control group. Levels of RIP140, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 were higher in the diabetic group compared to control. RIP140 expression was positively correlated with FFAs, HDL-c, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, FIN, FBG, and HOMA. Finally, 500\u2009\u03bcmol/L PA treatment increased RIP140 expression and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in cultured control PBMCs.\nContext 3: Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 24 diabetic and 30 healthy individuals. The levels of FFAs, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, FIN, and FBG were measured. The insulin resistance index was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Additionally, PBMCs from control group were cultured alone or with 500\u2009\u03bcmol/L palmitic acid (PA). Levels of RIP140 TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in PBMCs were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR, Western blots and ELISA. The relationship between RIP140 and other variables was performed using SPSS 11.5 software.\nContext 4: Diabetes was present in 22.7% of all sepsis patients. Throughout the study, plasma glucose levels were higher in diabetic patients. Mortality was equal in diabetic and nondiabetic patients (31.4% vs. 30.5% after 28 days). Markers of coagulation, fibrinolysis, and inflammation were generally equal in diabetic and nondiabetic patients, although on admission diabetic patients had slightly higher levels of anticoagulation markers. Interestingly, nondiabetic patients with admission hyperglycemia (>11.1 mmol/L; 200 mg/dL) had a higher mortality rate compared to those without admission hyperglycemia (43.0% vs. 27.2%).\nContext 5: There are strong associations between measures of inflammation and type 2 diabetes, but the causal directions of these associations are not known. We tested the hypothesis that common gene variants known to alter circulating levels of inflammatory markers are associated with type 2 diabetes. We found that common genetic variants in the genes encoding for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are associated with type 2 diabetes. We also found that common genetic variants in the genes encoding for the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1RA are associated with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that common genetic variants in the genes encoding for proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are associated with type 2 diabetes.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the expression of the receptor interaction protein 140 (RIP140) and the inflammatory cytokines in type 2 diabetes. RIP140 is a receptor for", "Question: Does age and gender influence on rate and duration of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation??\nExplanation: The influence of age and gender on the character of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAD) has not been described. To evaluate if pulse pressure (PP) is a risk predictor for atrial fibrillation (AF) in a longitudinal study of 60-year-old men and women from Stockholm (n\u2009=\u20094,232), free from AF at baseline, with primary end-point incident AF. Advanced age is an indication for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation though it is not clear that elderly patients have a higher prevalence of left atrial thrombus.

The study group included 1, 000 patients who underwent 2-stage rTKA for PJI and had a prior I&D. The control group included 1, 000 patients who underwent 2-stage rTKA for PJI and had no prior I&D. The primary outcome was failure of 2-stage rTKA. The secondary outcomes were repeat surgery, revision", "Contexts:\nContext 1: A recent study in young patients undergoing propofol-alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia demonstrated implicit memory for stories presented during operation using a postoperative reading speed task. In this study we investigated whether patients who tolerate only small amounts of anaesthetics are prone to develop implicit and explicit memories about intraoperative events.\nContext 2: Groups were well matched at baseline, with a mean +/- sd age of 63.0 +/- 10.4 yrs and weight of 88.7 +/- 16.7 kg. No difference was observed for length of surgery, length of intubation, or ICU stay (p >.05). DEX patients perceived a shorter length of intubation (p =.044). A deeper sedation level was found in the propofol group (p =.021), with similar morphine and midazolam requirements (p =.317). Patient-rated level of overall awareness as a marker of amnesia did not differ between groups (p =.653). The ability to rest or sleep trended toward significance favoring propofol (p =.051). On evaluation of questionnaire ratings, DEX patients expressed more discomfort (p =.046), pain (p =.096), and sleeping difficulty (p =.036). Similar comfort levels were reported during extubation (p =.179).\nContext 3: Although half of the patients seemed to be awake one or more times during the operation, no explicit memories of intraoperative events were reported. The forced-choice recognition of the stories was at chance level. No effect on reading speed was found in either the patients or the control subjects.\nContext 4: Thirty patients with poor physical status (ASA III-IV) undergoing cardioverter defibrillator implantation were included in the study. Patients were premedicated with intravenous midazolam and anaesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil infusions. During surgery one of two audio-tapes containing two short stories was played to the patients. Reading speed for the stories played during surgery and two similar stories from the other tape was tested 4 h later. Explicit memory was tested at 4 h and 24 h after audiotape presentation using a structured interview and a forced-choice recognition test pertaining to the story content. Thirty additional awake subjects served as controls.\nContext 5: Of 246 patients identified, 50 received propofol (AT = 10 +/- 2 h, 1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/kg) and 50 received remifentanil (AT = 10 +/- 2 h, 0.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg). The propofol group had a significantly lower mean intubation time (p =.001) and a significantly lower mean duration of surgery (p =.001). The propofol group had a significantly lower mean intubation time (p =.001) and a significantly lower mean duration of surgery (p =.001). The propofol group had a significantly lower mean intubation time (p =.001) and a significantly lower mean duration of surgery (p =.001). The propofol group", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The study showed that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protects the myocardium from ischaemic injury and may also protect the vascular endothelium from the deleterious effects of ischaemia and reperfusion. We examined the possibility that ischaemic preconditioning might preserve the integrity of the coronary microcirculation following ischaemia and reperfusion. Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) has been used in off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) to reduce potential injury secondary to ligation of the target vessel. Previous studies have shown that a brief period of repetitive coronary occlusion applied at the onset of reperfusion, postconditioning (postcon), attenuates myocardial", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Males have strikingly increased risk of advanced liver disease. However, the association between testosterone and risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related advanced liver disease is unknown. We performed a cross-sectional study in male veterans with chronic HCV. Blood samples were obtained to measure total serum testosterone and perform the FibroSURE-ActiTest. Other risk-factor data were obtained through systematic questionnaires (e.g., alcohol), physical measurements (e.g., body mass index), and serological tests (e.g., viral load). The association between total testosterone and risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis (F3 and F3/F4) and inflammatory activity (A3 and A2/3) measured by the FibroSURE-ActiTest was evaluated with logistic regression. A total of 308 eligible study participants were prospectively recruited (mean age: 57; 52% African-American). There were 105 cases with advanced fibrosis and 203 mild fibrosis controls as well as 88 cases with advanced inflammatory activity and 220 mild activity controls. Mean total serum testosterone was significantly higher in advanced fibrosis cases as well as advanced inflammatory activity cases, compared to mild disease controls (6.0 versus 5.3 ng/mL and 5.9 versus 5.4 ng/mL, respectively). We observed a significant 25% increase in advanced fibrosis risk and 15% increase in advanced inflammatory activity risk for each 1-ng/mL increase in total serum testosterone. Total testosterone in the upper tertile was associated with an even greater excess risk of advanced fibrosis than advanced inflammatory activity (odds ratio [OR](adjusted advanced fibrosis) = 3.74; 95% CI: 1.86-6.54 versus OR(adjusted advanced inflammatory activity) = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.07-4.93, respectively).\nContext 2: Obesity-related steatosis is an increasingly common histologic finding and often coexists with other chronic liver diseases. Although obesity and steatosis are recognized risk factors for more advanced fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease, it has not been determined whether these factors influence the progression of other diseases in which steatosis is not a feature of the primary liver insult.\nContext 3: Hepatic steatosis is common in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The effect of steatosis on anti-HCV therapy efficacy is unclear.\nContext 4: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of steatosis on the efficacy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and to determine whether steatosis is associated with the response to therapy.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of steatosis on the efficacy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and to determine whether steatosis is associated with the response to therapy.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of steatosis on the efficacy of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Results from recent studies on animal models of concussion suggest that multiple, rather than single, episodes of mild traumatic brain injury result in impaired cognitive performance in mice. The objective of the present study was to administer multiple impacts to the heads of mice while directly measuring the force of the impacts to determine how these parameters are related to transient loss of consciousness, cognitive deficits, and potential neuropathologic effects.\nContext 2: To determine the effect of time interval between repeat concussions on the cognitive function of mice.\nContext 3: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 173) were anesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 60 mg/kg) and subjected to lateral fluid percussion (FP) brain injury of moderate severity (n = 123) or sham injury (n = 50). Beginning 1 h post-injury, TNF mAB (n = 41, of which 25 were brain-injured) or IL-6 mAB (n = 42, of which 25 were brain-injured) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL was infused i.c.v ipsilateral to the injury for 48 hours. Vehicle-treated animals (control IgG; n = 43, of which 26 were brain-injured) served as controls. In Study 1, cognitive function was evaluated in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) followed by evaluation of regional cerebral edema at 48 h post-injury. In Study 2, animals were evaluated for neurological motor function and post-injury learning in the MWM at one week post-injury.\nContext 4: After 1 concussion, injured and sham-injured mice performed similarly in the Morris water maze. As the number of concussions increased, injured mice performed worse than sham-injured mice. Mice sustaining 5 concussions either 1 day or 1 week apart performed worse than sham-injured mice. When 5 concussions were delivered at 1-month time intervals, no difference in Morris water maze performance was observed between injured and sham-injured mice. After a 1-month recovery period, mice that sustained 5 concussions at daily and weekly time intervals continued to perform worse than sham-injured mice. One year after the final injury, mice sustaining 5 concussions at a daily time interval still performed worse than sham-injured mice.\nContext 5: The mean ( +/- SD) force of impact was 19 ( +/- 3.5) N. Impacted mice were anesthetized and their brains were removed. The brains were sectioned and the volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere was measured. The volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly greater in mice that sustained 5 concussions at a daily time interval than in sham-injured mice. The volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere was also significantly greater in mice that sustained 5 concussions at a weekly time interval than in sham-injured mice. The volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere was also significantly greater in mice that sustained 5 concussions at a daily time interval than in mice that sustained 5 concussions at a weekly time interval.\nContext 6: The mean ( +/- SD) force of impact was 19 ( +/- 3.5", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Omega-3 (omega-3) fatty acids (FA), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), attenuate cytokine-mediated inflammation. Currently, in the United States, there is no commercial source of omega-3 lipid for clinical use. A clinically used European lipid emulsion, Omegaven, has been shown to have beneficial antiinflammatory effects; however, the mechanisms of its action are not well defined. In the present work, this omega-3 FA emulsion has been evaluated in order to define its effects on TNF-alpha production in a model of LPS-stimulated macrophages.\nContext 2: Unstimulated RAW cell TNF-alpha production was similar in all groups and < 60 pg/mL. Lipovenos pretreatment did not alter TNF-alpha production from that of baseline compared to LPS-stimulated cells. Four-hour Omegaven pretreatment significantly reduced TNF-alpha production in LPS-stimulated cells, with a 46% reduction in TNF-alpha from baseline observed.\nContext 3: We demonstrated that physiological concentrations of lycopene were able to attenuate the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated induction of TNF-\u03b1 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The molecular mechanism was studied. It appeared that the LPS-activation of both JNK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways was modulated by lycopene. The anti-inflammatory effects of lycopene on macrophages were accompanied by a decrease in LPS-stimulated macrophage migration in the presence of lycopene. Furthermore, lycopene decreased macrophage conditioned medium-induced proinflammatory cytokine, acute phase protein, and chemokine mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\nContext 4: Suppressive effects on NO generation in vitro were assayed in LPS-stimulated macrophages (M\u03c6). In vivo anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated with LPS-challenged ICR mice. Mechanistic analyses were done by ELISA, Western blot, RT-PCR, etc.\nContext 5: All MCT-containing lipid emulsions activated leukocytes by inducing changes in expression of membrane markers and stimulus induced ROS production, whereas MCT-free lipid emulsions lacked this effect. Moreover, addition of n-3 FA to LCT/MCT did not prevent MCT-induced immune activation. TLR-4 inhibitors, but not TLR-2 inhibitors, prevented MCT-induced immune activation. In addition, MCT-induced immune activation was prevented by the addition of n-3 FA to LCT/MCT. These results suggest that MCT-induced immune activation is mediated by TLR-4 and that n-3 FA can prevent this activation.\nContext 6: The effects of a novel lipid emulsion, Omegaven, on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages were investigated. Omegaven was found to be a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 production. The effects of Omegaven on LPS-induced chemok", "Yes, gender and race/ethnicity affect the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening.

Statins have been recently suggested to exert protective cerebral effects. This study investigated whether preoperative statins were associated with decreased incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.\nContext 2: Delirium affected 89 patients (3%), and preoperative statin administration was not multivariably associated with a decreased incidence of delirium (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 2.37; p=0.18) and was also unrelated to a delirium decrease in patient subgroups undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 2.52; p=0.51) or combined valvular procedures (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 3.07, p=0.08). Similar results were observed for age groups and cardiopulmonary bypass durations. Patients affected by postoperative delirium experienced a longer hospital stay (25th to 75th percentile) of 11 (7 to 18 days) vs 7 days (7 to 8 days, p<0.001) and 12% hospital mortality vs 1% (p<0.001).\nContext 3: Statin use prior to cardiac surgery has been reported to improve outcomes in the postoperative period because of other effects apart from decreasing lipid levels. Objective of the study was to analyse mortality and acute renal failure (ARF) during the cardiac surgery postoperative period in patients treated with or without statins.\nContext 4: Statins improve clinical outcome after cardiac surgery, but it is unclear whether they exert their effects by modifying the myocardial redox state.\nContext 5: Statin therapy in nonsurgical patient populations is associated with a significant reduction in adverse cardiovascular events, including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Recently, statin therapy was shown to be associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative mortality in patients undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery. We investigated the influence of preoperative statin therapy on adverse outcomes after primary coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n1.

A malfunction of retinoid X receptor-\u03b1 (RXR-\u03b1) due to phosphorylation by Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase is closely associated with liver carcinogenesis and acyclic retinoid (ACR) can prevent HCC development by inhibiting RXR-\u03b1 phosphorylation. The present study examined the possible combined effects of ACR plus branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), which can also prevent the development of HCC in obese patients with liver cirrhosis, in human HCC xenografts in nude mice.\nContext 2: Retinoids are used to treat several types of cancer; however, their effects on liver cancer have not been fully characterized. To investigate the therapeutic potential of retinoids on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the present study evaluates the apoptotic effect of a panel of natural and synthetic retinoids in three human HCC cell lines as well as explores the underlying mechanisms.\nContext 3: \u2002 This study examined the effects of the combination of ACR plus BCAA on the growth of Huh7 human HCC xenografts in nude mice. The effects of the combination on the phosphorylation of RXR-\u03b1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) proteins, and on the expression levels of retinoic acid receptor-\u03b2 (RAR-\u03b2) and p21(CIP1)  mRNA, were also examined by western blot and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses, respectively.\nContext 4: It could be shown that the clonogenic inactivation of tumor cells under retinoid treatment alone or in combination with irradiation was not correlated with the induction of RAR-beta on mRNA and protein level, respectively. The control cells (HSF6), however, demonstrated an induction.\nContext 5: The retinoid responsiveness of seven human tumor cell lines (HTB35, HTB43, SCC4, SCC9, MDA-MB231, HCT116, and CaSki) as well as one normal human skin fibroblast (HSF6) as control cells was analyzed by colony formation assay under retinoid and retinoid/radiation treatment. Basic mRNA levels of all retinoic acid receptors as well as the treatment-dependent modulation of retinoic acid receptor-\u03b2 (RAR-\u03b2) and retinoid X receptor-\u03b1 (RXR-\u03b1) mRNA levels were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.

We recently showed in rats that a neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist is capable of reducing adhesion formation. To determine the clinical feasibility of using an NK-1R antagonist to reduce adhesions, this study examined the time dependence for the effectiveness of NK-1R antagonist administration and its effects on wound healing.\nContext 2: The NK-1R antagonist significantly reduced (P=.003) intraabdominal adhesions when administered during or 1 hour after surgery, only moderately reduced (P=.08) adhesions when administered at 5 hours, and had no effect at 12 or 24 hours. Peritoneal tPA activity was significantly increased (P<.05) in peritoneal fluid 24 hours after administration of the NK-1R antagonist regardless of the surgical procedure. The NK-1R antagonist did not alter colonic anastomotic healing.\nContext 3: Adhesions were surgically induced in rats receiving a single intraperitoneal infusion of the NK-1R antagonist, CJ-12,255, during or 1, 5, 12, or 24 hours after surgery. Adhesion formation was assessed 7 days later. In a subset of animals, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) activity, which is a measure of peritoneal fibrinolytic activity, was determined in peritoneal fluid 24 hours after surgery (48 hours for animals infused at 24 hours). The tPA activity was also determined in nonoperated animals 24 hours after peritoneal injection of the NK-1R antagonist. Colonic burst pressures were measured 7 days after creation of anastomoses in rats that were administered the antagonist at surgery.\nContext 4: Hyaluronic acid (HA) agents reduce postsurgical adhesion formation. The effect of their perioperative administration on early anastomotic healing is unknown. This study investigated the influence of two HA-containing agents on the development of strength in colonic anastomosis during the first postoperative week, both in normal rats and in rats with bacterial peritonitis.\nContext 5: The safety and antiemetic efficacy of CP-122,721, a novel neurokinin-1 antagonist, was evaluated when administered alone or in combination with ondansetron.\n\nBased on the contexts above, the following conclusions were drawn:\n1. The NK-1R antagonist significantly reduced (P=.003) intraabdominal adhesions when administered during or 1 hour after surgery, only moderately reduced (P=.08) adhesions when administered at 5 hours, and had no effect at 12 or 24 hours. Peritoneal tPA activity was significantly increased (P<.05) in peritoneal fluid 24 hours after administration of the NK-1R antagonist regardless of the surgical procedure.

It is based on the premise that the administration of analgesic drugs before the onset of pain can reduce the intensity of pain and the need for analgesic drugs after the onset of pain. Preemptive analgesia has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. However, the effects of preemptive analgesia on postoperative pain and opioid requirements in patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: It has been demonstrated that uraemic serum/ultrafiltrate inhibits cell-mediated immune response in vitro, and that it suppresses calcitriol synthesis and its biological actions.\nContext 2: In the present in vitro study, the effect of calcitriol, uraemic ultrafiltrate (UUF) and a combination of both on the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL-60, was studied by evaluating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into the DNA, luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (CL) production, expression of CD14, and levels of vitamin D receptor mRNA (VDR mRNA) and CD14 mRNA.\nContext 3: The ability of calcitriol to block cell proliferation (37.4+/-5.4 to 30.5+/-5.6% cells incorporating BrdU, P:<0.01) was neutralized when UUF was applied together with calcitriol (53.4+/-21.3% cells incorporating BrdU, P:<0.01 vs calcitriol alone). Similarly to what was observed for BrdU incorporation, the CL production of HL-60 cells was enhanced in the presence of calcitriol (20126+/-10154 to 61528+/-24021 cpm, P:<0.01), and was suppressed again in the presence of calcitriol and UUF (20916+/-12075 cpm, P:<0.01 vs calcitriol alone); finally UUF also inhibited the calcitriol-induced CD14 expression (71.1+/-11.2 to 54.9+/-17.7% CD14 positive cells, P:<0.05). On the other hand, the calcitriol-induced CD14 mRNA levels were not significantly different in the presence of calcitriol and UUF compared to calcitriol alone. This points to an inhibition by UUF at a post-transcriptional level. Similar data were found for VDR mRNA levels. UUF was fractionated by HPLC in four fractions, hydrophilic uraemic solutes being eluted first (F1) and hydrophobic solutes being eluted last (F4); fractions 1, 2 and 3 simultaneously affected both BrdU incorporation and CL production in a significant way.\nContext 4: The present study demonstrates that UUF inhibits the calcitriol-induced CD14 expression and CD14 mRNA levels in HL-60 cells. This effect is not mediated by the calcitriol-induced VDR mRNA levels, but is probably due to the presence of hydrophobic uraemic solutes in the UUF.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The purpose of this study was to determine whether rhGH administered locally during the surgical placement of an implant, in the tibia of an osteoporotic rabbit model, would induce qualitative and quantitative differences in peri-implant bone reaction.\nContext 2: Eight New Zealand rabbits were ovariectomized and fed with a low-calcium diet (with 0.07% of calcium) to induce osteoporosis. After 6 weeks, an experimental titanium sheet was inserted into the rabbit tibiae. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group was treated with 4 IU of rhGH added locally into the ostectomy as a lyophilized powder and the control group was left without any treatment. After 2 weeks, animals were sacrificed, tibial sections were prepared and bone-titanium interface was examined at light microscopy, using Masson, hematoxylin-eosin and Pichrosirius stains. Light microscopic morphometry and densitometry were used to comparatively quantitate bone reaction.\nContext 3: Previous studies showed that endogenous fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is required for parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated bone anabolic effects, however, the exact mechanisms by which PTH stimulate bone formation and the function of FGF receptors in mediating these actions are not fully defined. FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3) has been characterized as an important regulator of bone metabolism and is confirmed to cross-talk with PTH/PTHrP signal in cartilage and bone development.\nContext 4: Whereas alphaCGRP-/- -mice display an osteopenia at all ages analyzed, the Calca-/- -mice develop a phenotype of high bone turnover with age. Histomorphometric analysis performed at the age of 12 months revealed significant increases of bone formation and bone resorption specifically in the Calca-/- -mice. This severe phenotype that can result in hyperostotic lesions, can not be explained by obvious endocrine abnormalities other than the absence of CT.\nContext 5: The AR was found to be expressed in both male and female fetal rat metatarsal bones. Neither oxandrolone nor testosterone had any effect on metatarsal bone growth when tested at a wide concentration range (1 nM to 10 microM), not even in the presence of IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or charcoal-treated serum (10%). Bone growth was also not affected by the administration of the AR antagonist, ICI 182,780 (10 microM). The AR was found to be expressed in both male and female fetal rat metatarsal bones. Neither oxandrolone nor testosterone had any effect on metatarsal bone growth when tested at a wide concentration range (1 nM to 10 microM), not even in the presence of IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or charcoal-treated serum (10%). Bone growth was also not affected by the administration of the AR antagonist, ICI 182,780 (10 microM).", "Question: Are increased soluble VCAM-1 serum levels in preeclampsia correlated to urinary excretion or circadian blood pressure rhythm??\nExplanation: The aim of our study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to ascertain their relation to blood pressure.\nThe median VCAM-1 plasma levels were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5 ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a typical circadian rhythm,", "No. The continuous infusion of pantoprazole with octreotide did not improve management of variceal hemorrhage.

To test if PDGF stimulation of resident fibroblasts causally contributes to fibrosis, we employed inhibition of PDGF receptor signalling with the orally available kinase inhibitor Imatinib.\nContext 2: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) causes human myocarditis, which can result in cardiac damage, maladaptive remodeling, and heart failure. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-8 and -9 have been identified in virus-infected myocardium, but their particular roles and underlying mechanisms of effect are unknown. For the first time, we examine the severity of CVB3-induced myocarditis in MMP-8-and MMP-9-deficient mice.\nContext 3: Viral myocarditis, which is often caused by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), is a serious clinical disorder characterized by excessive myocardial inflammation. Valproic acid (VPA) is described as a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory effects in several inflammatory diseases. However, the role and the detailed mechanism of VPA in viral myocarditis remain unclear.\nContext 4: Enterovirus infection markers were detected in 20 (40%) of 50 patients who died suddenly of MI, 2 (4%) of 50 matched subjects without cardiac disease (p < 0.001), and 4 (8%) of 50 matched patients exhibiting a noncoronary chronic cardiopathy (p < 0.001). All of the EV RNA-positive patients exhibited VP1, which provided evidence of viral protein synthesis activity. The VP1 gene sequences amplified after cloning from myocardial or coronary samples of 8 of the MI patients and showed a strong homology with sequences of coxsackievirus B2 and B3 serotypes. Moreover, in the endomyocardial tissue of these 8 patients, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that there was disruption of the sarcolemmal localization of dystrophin in the same tissue areas that were infected by coxsackieviruses.\nContext 5: Acute viral myocarditis is an important cause of cardiac failure in young adults for which there is no effective treatment apart from general heart failure therapy. The present study tested the hypothesis that the viral myocarditis-associated cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key mediator of the inflammatory response in acute viral myocarditis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in the pathogenesis of myocarditis in a murine model of viral myocarditis. The results showed that the CVB3 infection induced myocarditis in mice, which was characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the activation of inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of inflammatory genes. The results also showed that the CVB3 infection induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of inflammatory genes in the myocardium, which was accompanied by the infiltration", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter and syncope have been considered risk factors for sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nContext 2: QT dispersion (QTD) reflects regional variation of ventricular repolarization. However, the relationship between QTD and the regional variation of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is not yet elucidated.\nContext 3: Eighty-four patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (62 males, age 43 +/- 12 years) had a two-dimensional echocardiographic study and a 48-h Holter. Myocardial blood flow was measured by positron emission tomography, at baseline and after dipyridamole, and the coronary vasodilator reserve was computed as dipyridamole myocardial blood flow/baseline myocardial blood flow. In 27 patients, subendocardial and subepicardial myocardial blood flow was measured in the septum and the subendocardial/subepicardial ratio was computed. Twenty of 84 patients had at least one syncopal episode, and 26 had at least one run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter. Baseline and dipyridamole myocardial blood flow, coronary vasodilator reserve, and baseline and dipyridamole subendocardial/subepicardial myocardial blood flow ratio were similar in patients with and without syncope and with and without non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on Holter. However, patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia had larger left ventricular end-diastolic (47 +/- 6 vs 44 +/- 5 mm, P < 0.05) and end-systolic diameters (30 +/- 6 vs 27 +/- 4 mm, P < 0.05).\nContext 4: Abnormalities in systolic and diastolic function shown by tissue Doppler imaging have been shown to be present in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who do not yet show clinical or echocardiographic evidence of the disease. These become more marked as left ventricular hypertrophy develops. We attempted to show that these abnormalities could be reversed by treatment with diltiazem.\nContext 5: Myocardial fibrosis (MF) occurs in up to 80% of subjects with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The aim of this study was to determine whether MF is associated with left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and whether it is reversible by treatment with diltiazem.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with increased risk of sudden death.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with increased risk of sudden death.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Functional and structural changes in pulmonary vasculature characterize pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and the prognosis of advanced PAH remains poor despite progress in pharmacotherapy. Adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) promote cell regeneration at pathological sites and comprise a novel therapy for ailments of various organs. We investigated the effects of ADRC therapy in rat models of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) and the underlying mechanisms.\nContext 2: Cardiac cachexia is a catabolic state in which adipose tissue atrophy is accompanied by a proinflammatory state. The molecular mechanisms underlying proinflammatory activation remain, however, largely unknown. In this experimental study, the effect of a high-calorie diet was analyzed in the advanced stages of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH).\nContext 3: Both Bay41-2272 and Bay58-2667 dose-dependently inhibited the pressor response of acute hypoxia in the isolated perfused lung system. When wild-type (NOS3(+/+)) or NOS3(-/-) mice were housed under 10% oxygen conditions for 21 or 35 days, both strains developed pulmonary hypertension, right heart hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, demonstrated by an increase in fully muscularized peripheral pulmonary arteries. Treatment of wild-type mice with the activator of sGC, Bay58-2667 (10 mg/kg per day), or the stimulator of sGC, Bay41-2272 (10 mg/kg per day), after full establishment of pulmonary hypertension from day 21 to day 35 significantly reduced pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and structural remodeling of the lung vasculature. In contrast, only minor efficacy of chronic sGC activator therapies was noted in NOS3(-/-) mice. In monocrotaline-injected rats with established severe pulmonary hypertension, both compounds significantly reversed hemodynamic and structural changes.\nContext 4: Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) show similarities to cancer cells. Due to the growth-suppressive and pro-apoptotic effects of p53 and its inactivation in cancer, we hypothesized that the p53 pathway could be altered in PAH. We therefore explored the involvement of p53 in the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and the pathophysiological consequences of p53 inactivation in response to MCT.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the novel phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, BAY 41-2272, on the pulmonary vascular remodeling in a rat model of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH). The effects of BAY 41-2272 on the pulmonary vascular remodeling were evaluated by morphometric analysis of the pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle.

We observed a significant association between Caesarean delivery and abdominal obesity in crude analyses (OR: 1.66; 1.02-2.69, p = 0.04), but this disappeared after adjusting for covariates (OR: 1.96; 0.82-4.69, p = 0.13).\nContext 3: In a cross-sectional study, 635 children aged from 6 to 12 years of age (476 girls and 159 boys) were randomly selected from Isfahan elementary schools. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured. General obesity and abdominal obesity were defined based on World Health Organization growth charts and Iranian national cut-off points, respectively. Parents were asked about delivery type and other factors potentially related to childhood obesity using a self-administered questionnaire. The association between delivery type and obesity was examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.\nContext 4: With increasing maternal age, maternal and newborn body dimensions increased significantly. Although extremely young mothers were significantly shorter and lighter and exhibited the significantly lowest pre-pregnancy weight status and the narrowest pelvic dimensions, they showed the lowest rates of caesarean sections (13.1%) and, unexpectedly, not the highest rate of low weight newborns (<2,500 g). In contrast, for mothers older than 35 years the highest rate of low weight newborns (3.7%) and the highest rate of macrosom newborns (<4,000 g) were found. Furthermore, mothers older than 40 years experienced the significantly highest rate of caesarean section (31.3%).\nContext 5: Maternal overweight and obesity are associated with slower labour progress and increased caesarean delivery for failure to progress. Obesity is also associated with hyperlipidaemia and cholesterol inhibits myometrial contractility in vitro. Our aim was, among overweight and obese nulliparous women, to investigate 1. the role of early pregnancy serum cholesterol and 2. clinical and biochemical predictors of caesarean delivery.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of caesarean delivery in a population-based cohort of 1,000,000 women.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of caesarean delivery in a population-based cohort of 1,000,000 women.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal body mass index (BMI) and the risk of caesarean delivery in a population-based cohort of 1,000,000 women.\nContext 9: The", "Yes, thermal sensory and pain thresholds in the tongue and chin change with age, but altered in patients with BMS.\nThe study was designed to examine thermal sensory and pain thresholds in the oral mucosa and chin, both innervated by the trigeminal nerve, in patients with BMS, as well as in healthy controls. In addition, the study proposed to examine whether there are any differences in oral thermal and pain sensations between the advanced age group, where BMS is prevalent and a younger group.\nThe study was conducted in 20 patients with BMS and 20 healthy controls. The patients with BMS were divided into two groups: one group of 10 patients over 50 years of age", "Question: Does the Fatty Liver Index have limited utility for the detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis in obese patients??\nThe Fatty Liver Index (FLI) is a simple, noninvasive tool for the detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis in obese patients. The FLI is based on the sum of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triglycerides, and \u03b3-glutamyl-transferase (GGT). The FLI has been validated in a large cohort of obese patients and has been shown to be a useful screening tool for the detection of hepatic steatosis. However, the FLI has not been validated in a large cohort of obese patients with Type 2 diabetes", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Chronic hepatitis B infection is characterized by hepatic immune and inflammatory response with considerable variation in the rates of progression to cirrhosis. Genetic variants and environmental cues influence predisposition to the development of chronic liver disease; however, it remains unknown if aberrant DNA methylation is associated with fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis B.\nContext 2: Changes in DNA methylation patterns are believed to be early events in hepatocarcinogenesis. A better understanding of methylation states and how they correlate with disease progression will aid in finding potential strategies for early detection of HCC. The aim of our study was to analyze the methylation frequency of tumor suppressor genes, P14, P15, and P73, and a mismatch repair gene (O6MGMT) in HCV related chronic liver disease and HCC to identify candidate epigenetic biomarkers for HCC prediction.\nContext 3: 516 Egyptian patients with HCV-related liver disease were recruited from Kasr Alaini multidisciplinary HCC clinic from April 2010 to January 2012. Subjects were divided into 4 different clinically defined groups - HCC group (n=208), liver cirrhosis group (n=108), chronic hepatitis C group (n=100), and control group (n=100) - to analyze the methylation status of the target genes in patient plasma using EpiTect Methyl qPCR Array technology. Methylation was considered to be hypermethylated if >10% and/or intermediately methylated if >60%.\nContext 4: DNA methylation (5-mC) is an epigenetic mark that is an established regulator of transcriptional repression with an important role in liver fibrosis. Currently, there is very little knowledge available as to how DNA methylation controls the phenotype of hepatic stellate cell (HSC), the key cell type responsible for onset and progression of liver fibrosis. Moreover, recently discovered DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hmC) is involved in transcriptional activation and its patterns are often altered in human diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation in liver fibrosis.\nContext 5: In our series, a significant difference in the hypermethylation status of all studied genes was noted within the different stages of chronic liver disease and ultimately HCC. Hypermethylation of the P14 gene was detected in 100/208 (48.1%), 100/108 (92.6%), 100/100 (100%), and 100/100 (100%) patients in the HCC, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, and control groups, respectively. Hypermethylation of the P15 gene was detected in 100/208 (48.1%), 100/108 (92.6%), 100/100 (100%), and 100/100 (100%) patients in the HCC, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, and control groups, respectively.

The objective of this experiment was to demonstrate that endobronchial gene transfer of soluble type I interleukin-1 receptor IgG to donor lung grafts reduces posttransplant ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nContext 2: All experiments utilized an orthotopic left lung isograft transplant model. Donors were divided into three groups (n = 6 each) for endobronchial transfection: group I received 2 x 10(7) plaque-forming units of adenovirus encoding soluble type I interleukin-1 receptor IgG; group II received 2 x 10(7) plaque-forming units of nonfunctional control adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase; and group III received 0.1 mL of saline. Left lungs were harvested 24 hours after transfection and stored for 18 hours before transplantation. Graft function was assessed 24 hours after reperfusion using three measurements: isolated graft oxygenation, wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Transgene expression of soluble type I interleukin-1 receptor IgG was also evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry.\nContext 3: Ischemia-reperfusion injury accounts for one-third of early deaths after lung transplantation. To expand the limited donor pool, lung retrieval from non-heart beating donors (NHBD) has been introduced recently. However, because of potentially deleterious effects of warm ischemia on microvascular integrity, use of NHBD lungs is limited by short tolerable time periods before preservation. After intravenous prostanoids are routinely used to ameliorate reperfusion injury, the latest evidence suggests similar efficacy of inhaled prostacyclin. Therefore, the impact of donor pretreatment with the prostacyclin analogue iloprost on postischemic NHBD lung function and preservation quality was evaluated.\nContext 4: Cold ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of graft failure in lung transplantation. Despite therapeutic benefits of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in attenuating acute lung injury, their protection of lung transplants from cold IRI remains elusive. The present study was to test the efficacy of MSCs in the prevention of cold IRI using a novel murine model of lung transplantation.\nContext 5: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a novel, noninvasive, and nonpharmacologic method of lung recruitment on lung function and gas exchange in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nContext 6: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a novel, noninvasive, and nonpharmacologic method of lung recruitment on lung function and gas exchange in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nContext 7: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a novel, noninvasive, and nonpharmacologic method of lung recruitment on lung function and gas exchange in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nContext 8:", "#1: Intraoperative cholangiography is not essential to avoid duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of non-lethal rates (0, 180, 360 and 720 g AI ha(-1)) of glyphosate on four-month-old 'Cravo' lime, Citrus limonia (L.) Osbeck, seedlings. Photosynthesis and the concentrations of shikimic acid, total free amino acids and phenolic acids were evaluated.\nContext 2: The growth of the plants and most ecophysiological parameters differed significantly between clones. The mean maximum shoot height varied from 0.9 to 1.86 m, P(max) from 9.7 to 27 \u00b5mol m(-2) s(-1), g(s) from 0.22 to 1.41 mol m(-2) s(-1) and WUE from 13 to 47 \u00b5mol mol(-1). The concentrations of chlorophylls did not vary significantly between clones, but the chlorophyll a/b ratio and the concentrations of total carotenoids did. The observed differences were not explained either by the ploidy level per se or by the geographic origin or phylogenetic relationships of the clones.\nContext 3: The entire world is facing a deteriorating environment. Understanding the mechanisms underlying plant responses to external abiotic stresses is important for breeding stress-tolerant crops and herbages. Phytohormones play critical regulatory roles in plants in the response to external and internal cues to regulate growth and development. Medicago falcata is one of the stress-tolerant candidate leguminous species and is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen. This ability allows leguminous plants to grow in nitrogen deficient soils.\nContext 4: Woodland spring ephemerals exhibit a relatively short epigeous growth period prior to canopy closure. However, it has been suggested that leaf senescence is induced by a reduction in the carbohydrate sink demand, rather than by changes in light availability. To ascertain whether a potentially higher net carbon (C) assimilation rate could shorten leaf lifespan due to an accelerated rate of storage, Erythronium americanum plants were grown under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (1100 ppm) CO2 concentrations.\nContext 5: Plants in the high-reproductive-effort treatment grew less between seasons but did not differ in their probability of flowering the second season.

AC reduced the risk of death as a protective treatment with statistical significance (HR=0.91, 95%CI: [0.85, 0.97], P=0.002), and it seemed more effective for Asian than non-Asian patients. The effects of AC were not influenced by the starting time (P>0.05). D2 lymphadenectomy-based chemotherapy was effective (HR=0.89, 95%CI: [0.80, 0.99], P=0.04). Oral S-1 40 mg/m2 after D2 lymphadenectomy might be a better choice for Asians with advanced GC and might result in a greater reduction of adverse events than in non-Asian patients. GRADE quality assessment determined that the strength of the evidence from foreign studies from Europe, the United States and Asian countries other than China was high, while it was moderate for Chinese studies.\nContext 2: In this study, 139 patients (42 female and 97 male patients, median age 53 years) with gastric adenocarcinoma received NACT. Chemotherapy-related toxicity was noted in 32% of patients. Of the 139 patients, 129 underwent gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy, with 12% morbidity and no mortality. Major pathological response of primary tumor was noted in 22 patients (17%). Of these 22 patients, lymph node metastases were noted in 12 patients. The median blood loss and lymph node yield was not significantly different to the 62 patients who underwent upfront surgery. Patients who underwent upfront surgery were older (58 vs. 52 years, P <0.02), had a higher number of distal cancers (63% vs. 82%, P <0.015) and a longer hospital stay (11 vs. 9 days, P <0.001).\nContext 3: A prospective randomised study involving 810 elderly patients was conducted in an attempt to compare alternating chemotherapy with conventional first-line chemotherapy in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in order to improve prognosis with an acceptable toxicity for elderly patients.\nContext 4: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (G-O) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) who had received prior chemotherapy.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (G-O) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) who had received prior chemotherapy.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (G-O) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) who had received prior chemotherapy.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In this study,methylation-specific PCR and real time quantitative PCR have been applied to investigate the effect of promoter methylation of the SOX11 gene on SOX11 expression in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and chronic inflammation tissues.

Here, we investigated the possible antiproliferative/proapoptotic effects of bromelain (from the pineapple stem Ananas comosus L., family Bromeliaceae) in a human colorectal carcinoma cell line and its potential chemopreventive effect in a murine model of colon cancer.\nContext 2: Proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated in human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells by the (3) H-thymidine incorporation assay and caspase 3/7 activity measurement, respectively. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and Akt expression were evaluated by Western blot analysis, reactive oxygen species production by a fluorimetric method. In vivo, bromelain was evaluated using the azoxymethane murine model of colon carcinogenesis. Bromelain reduced cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. The effect of bromelain was associated to downregulation of pERK1/2/total, ERK, and pAkt/Akt expression as well as to reduction of reactive oxygen species production. In vivo, bromelain reduced the development of aberrant crypt foci, polyps, and tumors induced by azoxymethane.\nContext 3: A complete in vitro multi-stage carcinogenesis model for oral cancer was developed to examine chemopreventive strategies. In the present study, the effects of EGCG [(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate], the major constituent of green tea, is being examined to understand mechanisms of action.\nContext 4: The present study compared the ability of different berry types to prevent chemically-induced tumorigenesis in the rat esophagus. We also determined if berries influence the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum of carcinogen-treated rats.\nContext 5: Among cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the commonest worldwide, and its incidence is increasing around the world. A lot of evidence underlines that natural substances usually consumed in the diet can have an important role in the prevention of cancer. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative activity of Citrus bergamia (bergamot) juice (BJ) in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n    - Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme found in the pineapple stem (Ananas comosus L., family Bromeliaceae).

We tested the hypotheses (1) that psychoacoustically measured tinnitus loudness is related to gamma oscillatory band power, and (2) that tinnitus loudness and tinnitus-related distress are related to distinct brain activity patterns as suggested by the distinction between loudness and distress experienced by tinnitus patients. Furthermore, we explored (3) how hearing impairment, minimum masking level, and (4) psychological comorbidities are related to spontaneous oscillatory brain activity in tinnitus patients.\nContext 2: Here, we show that the spontaneous neuronal activity of a group of individuals with tinnitus (n = 17) is characterised by a marked reduction in alpha (8-12 Hz) power together with an enhancement in delta (1.5-4 Hz) as compared to a normal hearing control group (n = 16). This pattern was especially pronounced for temporal regions. Moreover, correlations with tinnitus-related distress revealed strong associations with this abnormal spontaneous activity pattern, particularly in right temporal and left frontal areas. Overall, effects were stronger for the alpha than for the delta frequency band. A data stream of 5 min, recorded with a whole-head neuromagnetometer under a resting condition, was sufficient to extract the marked differences.\nContext 3: The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tinnitus perception are not well understood. Surprisingly, there have been no group studies comparing abnormalities in ongoing, spontaneous neuronal activity in individuals with and without tinnitus perception.\nContext 4: Resting state oscillatory brain activity recorded electroencephalographically from 46 male tinnitus patients showed a positive correlation between gamma band oscillations and psychoacoustic tinnitus loudness determined with the reconstructed tinnitus sound, but not with the other psychoacoustic loudness measures that were used. Tinnitus-related distress did also correlate with delta band activity, but at electrode positions different from those associated with tinnitus loudness. Furthermore, highly distressed tinnitus patients exhibited a higher level of theta band activity. Moreover, mean hearing loss between 0.125 kHz and 16 kHz was associated with a decrease in gamma activity, whereas minimum masking levels correlated positively with delta band power. In contrast, psychological comorbidities did not express significant correlations with oscillatory brain activity.\nContext 5: Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown promising results in the treatment of tinnitus. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of rTMS on spontaneous oscillatory brain activity in tinnitus patients. We found that rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduced spontaneous oscillatory activity in the alpha and delta frequency bands. Furthermore, rTMS of the DLPFC was associated with a reduction in tinnitus-related distress. These findings suggest that rTMS of the DLPFC may be a promising treatment option for tinnitus.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rTMS of the right DLPFC on spontaneous oscillatory brain activity in tinnitus", "Question: Does [ Single embryo transfer compromise the pregnancy rate in patients with good IVF/ICSI prognosis ]?\nExplanation: The aim of our study was to compare the efficiency of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) and double embryo transfer (DET) in the couples with a very good prognosis of IVF/ICSI.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 152 couples undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), including 75 cycles of IVF and 77 cycles of ICSI. We compared the rates of normal fertilization, high-quality embryos, transferrable embryos, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and abortion between the two groups.\nThe results showed that the pregnancy rate in the eSET", "Question: Does growth hormone treatment alter lower limb asymmetry in children with Russell-Silver syndrome??\nYes, growth hormone treatment alters lower limb asymmetry in children with Russell-Silver syndrome.\nThe study by Kato et al. (2010) was a retrospective study of 59 boys with non-GH deficient short stature. The boys were divided into 3 groups: group A consisted of 26 boys who were not treated with GH, group B consisted of 13 boys who were treated with GH alone, and group C consisted of 20 boys who were treated with combination therapy with GH and GS using cyproterone acetate. At the start of observation, the height SDS for BA and projected height were matched among these three groups", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Since returning from the Persian Gulf, nearly 100,000 veterans of the first Gulf War (GVs) have reported numerous symptoms with no apparent medical explanation. A primary complaint of these individuals is chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). CMP symptoms in GVs are similar to those reported by patients with fibromyalgia (FM), but have not received equivalent scientific attention. Exercise research in CMP patients suggests that acute exercise may exacerbate pain while chronic exercise can reduce pain and improve other symptoms. However, the influence of exercise on GVs with CMP is largely unexplored. This study examined the impact of an acute bout of exercise on pain sensitivity in GVs with CMP. Thirty-two GVs (CMP, n = 15; Control, n = 17) were recruited to complete a series of psychophysical assessments to determine pain sensitivity to heat and pressure stimuli before and after exercise. In response to heat-pain stimuli, GVs with CMP reported higher pain intensity and affect ratings than healthy GVs and exhibited a significant increase in ratings following exercise. GVs with CMP rated exercise as more painful and effortful and were generally more sensitive to heat-pain stimuli than healthy GVs. These results are similar to what has been reported for acute exercise in patients with FM.\nContext 2: A total of 1378 low back pain patients, many with acute symptoms, were included in the study. Nearly 40% of all patients reported sufficient physical activity at baseline. While there were significant improvements in patients' physical activity behaviour in all study arms, there was no evidence for an intervention effect.\nContext 3: Twenty participants volunteered (11 women; average age, 22.3 years; average body mass index, 23.5) for study participation. Reports of pain intensity at 48 hours ranged from 0 to 59 mm on the VAS. Muscle damage was confirmed by reductions in mechanical threshold (p=.011) and motor performance (p<.001) and by changes in T2-weighted MRI (p=.007). This study was powered to find an association of at least r=0.5 to be statistically significant. Correlations of continuous variables revealed no significant correlations between pain intensity and measures of muscle damage (ranging between -0.075 and 0.151). There was a significant association between the remaining torque deficit at 48 hours and pain area.\nContext 4: To improve pain management, the Veterans Health Administration launched the \"Pain as the 5th Vital Sign\" initiative in 2007. The initiative was designed to improve pain management by increasing the use of evidence-based interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a brief, evidence-based intervention for chronic pain management in a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) outpatient setting. The intervention was a 5-minute, self-administered, web-based, interactive, multimedia program that provided information on the causes and treatment of chronic pain. The intervention was delivered to 1,000 VHA patients with chronic pain. The intervention was delivered to 1,000 VHA patients with chronic pain.

We characterized an increasingly unequal distribution of chromosomes as mono-nucleated cells became multi-nucleated cells, some of which also contained chromosome-poor 'ghost' cell nuclei. Measurements of nuclear chromosome positions suggested chromosome overlaps in both types of cells. Spectral karyotyping then revealed both aneuploidy and complex chromosomal rearrangements: multiple breakage-bridge-fusion cycles were at the origin of the multiple rearranged chromosomes. This conclusion was challenged by super resolution three-dimensional structured illumination imaging of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg nuclei. Three-dimensional super resolution microscopy data documented inter-nuclear DNA bridges in multi-nucleated cells but not in mono-nucleated cells. These bridges consisted of chromatids and chromosomes shared by two Reed-Sternberg nuclei. The complexity of chromosomal rearrangements increased as Hodgkin cells developed into multi-nucleated cells, thus indicating tumor progression and evolution in Hodgkin's lymphoma, with Reed-Sternberg cells representing the highest complexity in chromosomal rearrangements in this disease.\nContext 2: Deleterious mutations of genes encoding proteins virtually anywhere within the BRCA pathway increased risks up to nearly 2000 fold for certain leukemias and lymphomas. Cancers with large increases in risk included mantle cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. Mantle cell lymphoma is defined by a characteristic rearrangement of DNA fragments interchanged between chromosomes 11 and 14. DNA translocations or rearrangements also occur in significant percentages of the other cancers.\nContext 3: We performed high-throughput sequencing of rearranged VDJ junctions in 14 pairs of matched diagnosis-relapse tumors, among which 7 pairs were further characterized by exome sequencing. We identify two distinctive modes of clonal evolution of DLBCL relapse: an early-divergent mode in which clonally related diagnosis and relapse tumors diverged early and developed in parallel; and a late-divergent mode in which relapse tumors developed directly from diagnosis tumors with minor divergence. By examining mutation patterns in the context of phylogenetic information provided by VDJ junctions, we identified mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as KMT2D as potential early driving events in lymphomagenesis. We also identified mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in DNA repair, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM, as potential late driving events in lymphomagenesis.", "Question: Does oximetry-guided reoxygenation improve neurological outcome after experimental cardiac arrest??\nExplanation: The study tested the hypothesis that graded reoxygenation, with oximetry guidance, can safely reduce FiO2 after resuscitation, avoiding hypoxia while promoting neurological recovery.\nContext 1: Current guidelines suggest that cardiac arrest (CA) survivors should be ventilated with 100% O2 after resuscitation. Breathing 100% O2 may worsen neurological outcome after experimental CA. This study tested the hypothesis that graded reoxygenation, with oximetry guidance, can safely reduce FiO2 after resuscitation, avoiding hypoxia while promoting neurological recovery.\nContext 2: Oxygen", "Question: Is proliferative and anti-apoptotic activity of esophageal mucosa in gastroesophageal reflux disease affected by fundoplication : a 4-year follow-up study??\nThe study was conducted in 20 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and 7 controls.

This study aims to investigate whether HBV genotypes influence the clinicopathologic features and long-term prognosis of patients after curative resection of HCC.\nContext 4: Genetic variations were identified through direct DNA sequencing using TaqMan assay in 1,439 patients with past or present HBV infection. Subjects included 404 spontaneously recovered patients, 313 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 305 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients and 417 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Three polymorphisms near the IL28B gene, rs8099917T>G, rs12979860C>T and rs12980275A>G, were identified. Associations between these polymorphisms and HBV clearance, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) clearance as well as HCC occurrence among patients were analyzed using logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and gender.\nContext 5: HBV/Ce was the predominant subgenotype in Taiwan. The prevalence of HBV/Ce was 93.6% in the inactive carriers group, 84.2% in chronic hepatitis patients, 81.2% in cirrhosis patients, 92.5% in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without cirrhosis and 91.9% in HCC patients with cirrhosis. There was no significant difference in the distribution of the HBV/C subgenotypes among patients with different stages of liver disease.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no.\n\n    - The study aims to investigate the effect of rs17401966 on the prognosis of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients at intermediate or advanced stages.\n    - The study aims to investigate the role of the genetic variants in KIF1B in the development of chronic hepatitis B.\n    - The study aims to investigate whether HBV genotypes influence the clinicopathologic features and long-term prognosis of patients after curative resection of HCC.\n    - The study aims to investigate the associations between the polymorphisms near the IL28B gene, rs8099917T>G, rs12979860C>T and rs12980275A>G, and HBV clearance, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg", "Question: Does obesity paradox disappear in coronary artery bypass graft patients during 20-year follow-up??\nYes, obesity paradox disappears in coronary artery bypass graft patients during 20-year follow-up.\nThe obesity paradox is a phenomenon in which patients with obesity have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than expected based on their body mass index (BMI). This phenomenon is observed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is thought to be due to the protective effects of obesity on the development of CAD. However, the obesity paradox is not observed in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This is because the obesity paradox is not observed in patients undergoing CABG because the protective effects of obesity on the development of CAD are not present in patients", "Question: Do hepatocyte exosomes mediate liver repair and regeneration via sphingosine-1-phosphate??\nYes, hepatocyte exosomes mediate liver repair and regeneration via sphingosine-1-phosphate.\nExosomes are small membrane vesicles released by cells and are involved in intercellular communication. Hepatocytes are known to release exosomes, but little is known about their biological function. We sought to determine if exosomes derived from hepatocytes contribute to liver repair and regeneration after injury.\nWe isolated hepatocyte exosomes from primary murine hepatocytes and characterized them biochemically and biophysically. Using cultures of primary hepatocytes, we tested whether hepatocyte exosomes induced proliferation of hepatocytes in vitro.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between bladder carcinoma patients and normal subjects were screened using empirical Bayes method of the linear models for microarray data package. Co-expression networks were constructed by differentially co-expressed genes and links. Regulatory impact factors (RIF) metric was used to identify critical transcription factors (TFs). The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and clusters were obtained through molecular complex detection (MCODE) algorithm. Centralities analyses for complex networks were performed based on degree, stress and betweenness. Enrichment analyses were performed based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.\nContext 2: To explore molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer (BC), network strategy was used to find biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis.\nContext 3: This study, using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), analyzed the expression levels of three selected genes in dissected tissues from normal bladder, noninvasive cancers, and muscle-invasive bladder carcinomas (n = 49). We compared gene expression levels of three genes (Aurora-A, and as control uroplakin II (UPII) and TBP, respectively) at different stages of bladder cancer. We used multivariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic curves and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.\nContext 4: Effective systemic therapeutic options are limited for bladder cancer. In this preclinical study we tested whether bladder cancer gene alterations may be predictive of treatment response.\nContext 5: It is well established that environmental toxins, such as exposure to arsenic, are risk factors in the development of urinary bladder cancer, yet recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide compelling evidence that there is a strong genetic component associated with disease predisposition. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs8102137, was identified on chromosome 19q12, residing 6 kb upstream of the important cell-cycle regulator and proto-oncogene, Cyclin E1 (CCNE1). However, the functional role of this variant in bladder cancer predisposition has been unclear because it lies within a non-coding region of the genome. Here, it is demonstrated that bladder cancer cells heterozygous for this SNP exhibit biased allelic expression of CCNE1 with 1.5-fold higher expression of the CCNE1 allele in bladder cancer cells compared to normal bladder epithelial cells. Furthermore, the CCNE1 expression level is inversely correlated with the expression of the CCNE1 promoter region. These findings suggest that the CCNE1 promoter region may be a potential target for bladder cancer therapy.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the CCNE1 gene in bladder cancer and to determine whether CCNE1 expression is associated with the clinical characteristics of bladder cancer.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the CCNE1 gene in bladder cancer and to determine whether CCNE1 expression is associated with the clinical characteristics of bladder cancer.\nContext", "Question: Does a single bout of resistance exercise promote excess postexercise energy expenditure in untrained young men with a family history of diabetes??\nExplanation: The study was conducted in 20 young men with a family history of type 2 diabetes.

In addition to facilitating its degradation, E6 may also inhibit p53 transactivity, though the mechanisms are still poorly understood. It has been reported that inhibition of p300, an acetyltransferase responsible for p53 acetylation is inactivated by E6. Activation of overexpressed p53 to cause cell growth inhibition is facilitated by its phosphorylation. Previously, we reported that non-genotoxically overexpressed p53 in HeLa cells needs to be phosphorylated to perform its cell growth inhibitory functions. Since over expressed p53 by itself was not activated, we hypothesized an inhibitory role for E6.\nContext 2: The correlation between p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations and the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA with the in vitro radiosensitivity of gynecological malignancies was studied in 26 cell lines derived from gynecological cancers of 23 patients.\nContext 3: To determine if human papillomaviruses (HPVs) play a role in the histogenesis of adenosarcomas of the uterine cervix.\nContext 4: Majority of reports proposes E6 mediated degradation of p53 as a possible reason for its inactivation. However, results presented here for the first time demonstrate that overexpressed p53 is not directly associated with E6 and therefore free, yet it is not functionally active in HPV positive cells. Also, the stability of overexpressed p53 does not seem to be an issue because inhibition of proteasomal degradation did not increase the half-life of overexpressed p53, which is more than endogenous p53. However, inhibition of proteasomal degradation prevents the degradation of endogenous p53. These findings suggest that overexpressed p53 and endogenous p53 are differentially subjected to proteasomal degradation and the reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear. Our studies demonstrate that p53 over expression has no effect on anchorage independent cell-growth and E6 nullifies its cell growth inhibitory effect. E6 overexpression abrogates OA induced p53 occupancy on the p21 promoter and cell death as well. E6 did not decrease p53 protein but phospho-p53 level was significantly reduced.\nContext 5: To investigate the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and to determine the association between HPV and p53 mutations in these tumors.\nContext 6: The role of p53 in the development of cervical cancer is well established.

However, its correlation with stroke severity has not been investigated. Moreover, studies on the association of MPV with functional outcome yielded inconsistent results.\nContext 2: We studied a total of 310 patients who were admitted within 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset. All patients had been taking aspirin for at least 7 days before stroke onset. Aspirin resistance, defined as high residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) on aspirin treatment, was measured using the VerifyNow assay and defined as an aspirin reaction unit \u2265550. Initial stroke severity was assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Infarct volume was measured using DWI.\nContext 3: To assess the the effect of antiplatelet therapy on the severity of subsequent stroke in patients with stroke and TIA.\nContext 4: We prospectively studied 498 patients with ischemic stroke who were admitted within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. CRP and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) were measured at the time of admission. Short-term functional outcome was measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Barthel ADL index (BI) 7 days after admission. Patients were followed for up to 2.5 years for long-term mortality and future vascular events data.\nContext 5: 100 patients were enrolled: 58 were ischemic (30 stroke, 28 TIA), 10 were unknown, and 28 were non-ischemic. Blood samples were collected after a median delay of 23 h (IQR: 17, 36) after symptom onset. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 activity level for ischemic (stroke and TIA) versus non-ischemic events were 186.5 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 153, 216.3) and 169 nmol/ml/min (IQR = 137, 212.5), respectively. The median levels of Lp-PLA2 mass level for ischemic versus non-ischemic events were 202 ng/ml (IQR = 171.6, 226.1) and 192 ng/ml (167.8, 230).

In this study the IGHV gene usage of anti-Rh-producing B cells in a woman who was immunized in the last trimester of her pregnancy was analyzed.\nContext 2: A plasma sample of the immunized person showed high levels of both anti-D and anti-G and low levels of anti-C. Anti-D and anti-G contributed equally strong to the ADCC whereas anti-C did not. Eighteen anti-D-, 5 anti-G-, and 1 anti-C-specific phage clones were found, of which 16, 2, and 1 used the IGHV3s genes, respectively.\nContext 3: Neither the donor nor the recipient GvHD risk alleles TNFd3/d3 and IL-10(-1064) (11-16) were associated with the development of aGvHD grades II to IV and I to IV. Because of the heterogeneity of CBTs, the data were reanalyzed separately for patients with malignancies (n=83) or with inborn errors (n=24). No significant association was observed between the severity of aGvHD and the possession of either TNFd3/d3 or IL-10 (11-16) genotypes. Mismatches for the mHags HY, HA-1, and CD31 exon 125 between donor and recipient did not associate with aGvHD grades II to IV.\nContext 4: The acute murine semiallogenic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is known to be associated with Th1 cytokines secreting lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes. However, whether this cytokine secretion pattern is also involved in the intestinal manifestations of acute GvHD (crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy) is not known, so far.\nContext 5: Compared with the non-Mi.III samples, the surface expression of the Rh antigen was reduced to 76\u00b74% in Mi.III(+/+) RBCs and 93\u00b76% in Mi.III(+/-). RhAG expression was also significantly reduced in Mi.III(+/+), but not in Mi.III(+/-) RBCs. The Rh antigen was not expressed on the surface of Mi.III(+/+) RBCs, but was expressed on the surface of Mi.III(+/-) RBCs. The Rh antigen was expressed on the surface of Mi.III(+/+) RBCs, but was not expressed on the surface of Mi.III(+/-) RBCs. The Rh antigen was expressed on the surface of Mi.III(+/+) RBCs, but was not expressed on the surface of Mi.III(+/-) RBCs.

The end-stage mediator of excess cellular collagen production is connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). The aim of this study was to investigate CTGF expression by in situ hybridization (ISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in CC and coeliac disease as well as lymphocytic colitis (LC), Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis (UC).\nContext 2: In coeliac disease, small-bowel mucosal permeability is increased in response to gluten consumption. However, the signalling routes leading to such a barrier defect remain obscure. As the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is up-regulated in untreated coeliac disease, and since this cascade has been related to epithelial hyperpermeability, the aim of this study was to establish whether blocking the EGFR route would restore the barrier after gliadin insult in vitro.\nContext 3: Fibroblasts isolated from strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) exhibit reduced responsiveness to stimulation with transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. TGF-beta1, acting through the smad pathway, is critical to fibroblast-mediated intestinal fibrosis. The membrane glycoprotein, endoglin, is a negative regulator of TGF-beta1.\nContext 4: For coeliac disease we analysed fresh frozen material by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and archival material for ISH. PCR transcripts in coeliac disease were moderately elevated and labelled cells were significantly increased in the subepithelial zone. For CC, LC and UC we investigated archival material because of the rarity of the first two conditions. There was a marked increase in CTGF expression in the subepithelial zone in CC, localizing to cells with the morphology of smooth muscle cells, which was not seen in LC.\nContext 5: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with differential expression of genes involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling, including FOXO3a, which encodes a transcription factor known to promote inflammation in several tissues. However, FOXO3a expression in tissues affected by UC has not been examined. This study investigated the effects of FOXO3a on UC pathogenesis.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\nYes, the expression of CTGF is increased in CC, LC and UC.

To determine if KLF9 suppresses intestinal adenoma formation, we generated mice of distinct Klf9 genotypes in the background of the Apc (Min/+) mouse and compared their adenoma burdens at 16 weeks of age. While small intestine adenoma burden remained unchanged among Klf9 genotypes, male and female Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(-/-) and Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(+/-) mice exhibited significantly more colon adenomas than their Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(+/+) counterparts. Microarray analysis showed significant increases in the expression of interferon-induced genes in the colon mucosa of female Apc (Min/+)/Klf9(+/-) and Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(-/-) compared to Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(+/+) mice, prior to overt adenoma occurrence. Gene upregulation was confirmed by qPCR of colon mucosa and by siRNA knockdown of KLF9 in human HT29 colorectal cancer cells. Increases in expression of these genes were further augmented by supplementation with Interferon \u03b21. Circulating levels of the cytokine, interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) were increased in Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(+/-) and Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(-/-) mice relative to Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(+/+). Additionally, colon mucosal levels of ISG15 were increased in Apc(Min/+)/Klf9(+/-) mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated KLF9 recruitment to the ISG15 promoter. Lastly, treatment with ISG15 suppressed apoptosis in HT29 cells, in the presence and absence of 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Results show KLF9 to be a haploinsufficient suppressor of colon tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice in part, by repression of ISG15 and the latter's antiapoptotic function.\nContext 2: To date, genomewide association studies have identified 10 genetic loci associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility. We hypothesized that these loci might also affect cancer survival.\nContext 3: We performed a genome-wide association study of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC cohort. We identified 10 loci associated with CRC survival (P < 5 \u00d7 10-8). The top 5 loci were rs1049093 (P = 1.1 \u00d7 10-8), rs1049094 (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10-8), rs1049095 (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10-8), rs1049096 (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10-8), and rs1049097 (P = 1.0 \u00d7 10-8).

There were no differences in the rates of factor V Leiden (2.8% vs 3.8%; relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.34-1.85), prothrombin gene mutation (2.8% vs 3.1%; relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.40-2.09), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism (13% vs 9%; relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.87-1.84) between mothers with small-for-gestational-age babies and control subjects, respectively. Inherited thrombophilias were not increased in small-for-gestational-age babies compared with control babies. Of small-for-gestational-age babies with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies (n = 25), 21% had a thrombophilia compared with 11% with normal umbilical artery Doppler studies (n = 68; relative risk, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.81-3.81).\nContext 2: The purpose of this study was to determine (1). whether the inherited thrombophilias (the factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [C677T] polymorphism) are increased in women with \"idiopathic\" (normotensive) small-for-gestational-age pregnancies and/or in their babies and (2). whether fetal carriage of a thrombophilia is associated with abnormal umbilical Doppler studies.\nContext 3: Of the 185 patients, 44 with thrombophilia and 26 without thrombophilia have conceived. Nineteen of the 44 pregnancies (43.2%) in thrombophilia patients have terminated in live births, compared with 8 of 26 pregnancies (30.8%) in patients without thrombophilia.

Six hundred and thirty-three legs had an ABPI50.85, 236 (39%) demonstrating isolated superficial venous reflux. Surgery was performed on 131 of these legs. Twelve and 24 week healing rates were 50% and 72% for operated legs and 62% and 74% for non-operated legs (p=0.67; Kaplan-Meier life table analysis). Recurrence rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 14%, 20% and 26% for operated legs and 28%, 30% and 44% for non-operated legs (p=0.03; Kaplan-Meier life table analysis).\nContext 3: consecutive patients with chronic leg ulcers were prospectively assessed at a one-stop clinic over a 4-year period from July 1995 to July 1999. All patients with ankle brachial pressure indices (ABPI)50.85 were initially treated with weekly four-layer bandaging. Venous duplex studies in all ulcerated legs assessed venous reflux pattern with surgery being offered to all those with isolated superficial reflux, of whom 56% accepted. Patients were advised to wear class two elastic compression stockings after healing.\nContext 4: Twenty-six patients, 18 women and 8 men, with a mean age of 50 years (range, 20 to 77 years) underwent SEPS. Preoperative evaluation confirmed superficial reflux in 65% of limbs, deep venous reflux in 77% of limbs, and perforator incompetence in 97% of limbs. All limbs had advanced venous dysfunction (C3, C4, C5, C6). All active ulcers (C6, n = 12) healed after surgery (mean, 32 +/- 3 days), and only 1 recurred during a mean follow-up period of 11 months (range, 1 to 43 months). Clinical score improved from 6.58 +/- 0.50 to 2.19 +/- 0.25 (P <.0001). Improved calf muscle pump function was demonstrated by means of postoperative SGP and was indicated by increased refill volume (RV: 0.27 +/- 0.06 vs 0.64 +/- 0.09 ml, P <.0001) and increased venous return (VR: 0.27 +/- 0.06 vs 0.64 +/- 0.09 ml, P <.0001).

Obese individuals have lower fasting plasma ghrelin levels but increased appetite, suggesting greater responses to endogenous ghrelin in obesity. The aim of this study was to compare effects of exogenous ghrelin (at a dose that stimulates growth hormone [GH] release in the physiologic range) versus placebo on gastric emptying, gastric volume, and postprandial symptoms and determine whether body mass (ranging from normal weight to obesity)", "Question: Is excision of the dilated pelvis necessary in laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty??\nExplanation: The surgical treatment of choice for significant hydronephrosis is dismembered pyeloplasty. While in open surgery, extensive resection of the dilated pelvis is common practice, laparoscopically usually only a sparing resection is performed. We compared the treatment results of both techniques to investigate whether extensive resection is necessary or not in dismembered pyeloplasty procedures.\nContext 2: To study the effects of the wide excision of soft tissues adjacent to the ovary and fallopian tube on ovarian function and surgical outcomes in women undergoing laparoscopic bilateral prophylactic", "Question: Do parkinson's disease genes segregate with breast cancer genes'loci??\nExplanation: The answer is no.

Anxiety was assessed using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory before, during, and at the end of treatment. Quality of life was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) before and at the end of treatment. Patients' satisfaction and perception of the organized medical record (OMR) were evaluated using a specifically designed questionnaire at the end of treatment.\nContext 3: Most patients (98%) who had the opportunity to obtain the OMR chose to do so. Anxiety levels did not increase in the SFA arm, although they did not differ significantly compared with anxiety levels in the RA arm. The patients who had full access to their medical record were more satisfied with information (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-2.9) and felt sufficiently informed more often (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.19), but the differences were not statistically significant at the 5% level.\nContext 4: We conducted retrospective chart reviews of electronic medical records to identify women who had a diagnosis of depression or anxiety in the year prior to the abnormal mammogram or Pap test.

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at particular risk for vitamin D deficiency. This may contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory response to pulmonary infection in CF.\nContext 2: Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism among dialysis patients. The biologic activity of vitamin D and its analogs is mediated by vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is distributed widely throughout the body. Recent papers have revealed that low vitamin D levels are correlated with severe fibrosis in chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis and hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects of vitamin D against the progression of peritoneal fibrosis.\nContext 3: 20.6\u00a0% of patients had NASH. The stage of fibrosis was F0 12.9\u00a0%, F1 57.36\u00a0%, F2 25.32\u00a0%, F3 (bridging fibrosis) 3.88\u00a0%, and F4 (cirrhosis) 0.52\u00a0%. The 25-OH vitamin D level inversely correlated to the NAS (r\u2009=\u20090.12 and p\u2009=\u20090.01) and to steatosis (r\u2009=\u20090.14 and p\u2009=\u20090.007); however, it was not associated with the presence of NASH. The level of vitamin D was significantly lower in patients with significant fibrosis compared to those without (15.9 (11.1-23.5) vs 19.6 (13.7-24.7) ng/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.02). There was an inverse correlation between the severity of fibrosis and the values of 25-OH vitamin D (r\u2009=\u20090.12 and p\u2009=\u20090.01). In a logistic regression analysis, no parameters were independently associated with the severity of fibrosis except the presence of steatohepatitis (1.94 (1.13-3.35) p\u2009=\u20090.017).\nContext 4: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects the lungs causing infections and inflammation.

Genotype distribution of the IL-10 -1082 polymorphism significantly differed between patients and controls (P < 0.05). However, the allele frequencies and genotype distribution of the IL-10 -1082 polymorphism did not differ between surviving and dead patients (P > 0.05). No significant differences in the genotype distribution and allele frequencies of the IL-10 -592 and IL-10 -819 polymorphisms were observed between patients with severe sepsis and healthy controls, nor between surviving and dead patients (P > 0.05).\nContext 3: Candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within bacterial recognition (TLR4 +896, CD14 -159) and inflammatory response (TNF-alpha -308, IL-1beta -31, IL-6 -174) loci were evaluated for association with increased risk for severe sepsis (sepsis plus organ dysfunction or septic shock) and mortality.\nContext 4: The genetic polymorphisms correlate with neither development nor outcome of sepsis. No correlations were found between C-reactive protein or WBC and the investigated SNPs. In patients in the ICU with abdominal surgery and multiple trauma, the TLR2-R753Q SNP was associated with infection at ICU admission (p<0.01); and for carriers of the TLR4-D299G SNP, a trend was observed (p=0.0776). Patients with multiple trauma carrying the TLR4-D299G SNP displayed significantly higher levels of procalcitonin (p=0.0212).\nContext 5: Genotype distribution and allele frequencies of severe sepsis patients were comparable to both control groups. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of both polymorphisms were associated significantly with the outcome of severe sepsis.

Such adverse cardiovascular events have day/night patterns with peaks in the morning (~9 AM), potentially related to endogenous circadian clock control of platelet activation. The objective was to test if the human endogenous circadian system influences (1) platelet function and (2) platelet response to standardized behavioral stressors. We also aimed to compare the magnitude of any effects on platelet function caused by the circadian system with that caused by varied standardized behavioral stressors, including mental arithmetic, passive postural tilt and mild cycling exercise.\nContext 2: Circadian rhythms control a vast array of biological processes in a broad spectrum of organisms. The contribution of circadian rhythms to the development of megakaryocytes and the regulation of platelet biology has not been defined.\nContext 3: We studied 12 healthy adults (6 female) who lived in individual laboratory suites in dim light for 240 h, with all behaviors scheduled on a 20-h recurring cycle to permit assessment of endogenous circadian function independent from environmental and behavioral effects including the sleep/wake cycle. Circadian phase was assessed from core body temperature. There were highly significant endogenous circadian rhythms in platelet surface activated glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, GPIb and P-selectin (6-17% peak-trough amplitudes; p \u2264 0.01). These circadian peaks occurred at a circadian phase corresponding to 8-9 AM. Platelet count, ATP release, aggregability, and plasma epinephrine also had significant circadian rhythms but with later peaks (corresponding to 3-8 PM). The circadian effects on the platelet activation markers were always larger than that of any of the three behavioral stressors.\nContext 4: The sympathetic nervous system has been implicated in the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction and sudden death. It has been postulated that sympathetic nerve activity is higher in the morning than at other times of the day and that this increase reflects an endogenous circadian pattern or is triggered by changes in posture and the onset of morning activities.\nContext 5: Platelets prepared after holding of whole blood overnight at 22 degrees C have a well-preserved metabolism. However, the possibility that such prolonged incubation with active granulocytes may increase platelet activation has not been fully tested.\n\nBased on the above, we hypothesized that (1) the circadian system influences platelet function and (2) the magnitude of any effects on platelet function caused by the circadian system is larger than that caused by varied standardized behavioral stressors, including mental arithmetic, passive postural tilt and mild cycling exercise.\n\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, San Francisco.

Eighty-one patients were admitted within 3 h of onset of neurological deficit, of which 28 received IV thrombolysis. In 25 patients no thrombolytic treatment was given because of the presence of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) exclusion criteria, and one patient refused treatment. No thrombolytic treatment was given to 27 patients because of mild neurological deficit or rapid clinical improvement, and after 3 months all these patients were independently living at home without nursing help. Despite a public campaign to gain awareness concerning stroke, the majority of the patients arrived too late at the ED for thrombolytic treatment.\nContext 5: Intra-arterial therapy has improved recanalization rates compared with intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke; however, superior clinical efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated. Time to recanalization is postulated as a mechanism hindering the efficacy of intra-arterial therapy.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in 250 words or less.\n\n## Context 1\n\nThe number of eligible patients was compared with the number actually treated.\n\n## Context 2\n\nThe proportion of patients with an ischemic stroke that received intravenous (IV) thrombolytic treatment, and reasons why patients are not treated.\n\n## Context 3\n\nTo determine the eligibility of patients with ischaemic stroke admitted to the 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland, for intravenous thrombolysis; to identify the major exclusions and assess whether organisational changes in the in-hospital stroke pathway and informative campaign in the local community and medical services can increase the number of patients treated; and to establish whether lack of previous experience with", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To determine the efficacy of long-term anti-miR-33 therapy on the progression of atherosclerosis in high-fat, high-cholesterol-fed Ldlr(-/-) mice.\nContext 2: Ldlr(-/-) mice received saline, or control or anti-miR-33 oligonucleotides once a week for 14 weeks. The treatment was effective, as measured by reduced levels of hepatic miR-33 and increased hepatic expression of miR-33 targets. Analysis of plasma samples revealed an initial elevation in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 2 weeks of treatment that was not sustained by the end of the experiment. Additionally, we found a significant increase in circulating triglycerides in anti-miR-33-treated mice, compared with controls. Finally, examination of atheromata revealed no significant changes in the size or composition of lesions between the 3 groups.\nContext 3: Atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability is accompanied by changes in the molecular and cellular function in the plaque shoulder, including a decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. We aimed to determine whether the expression of 3 miRNAs that regulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (miR-145, miR-221, and miR-222) is altered with plaque rupture, suggesting a role in regulating plaque stability.\nContext 4: The function of microRNAs is highly context and cell type dependent because of their highly dynamic expression pattern and the regulation of multiple mRNA targets. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) plays an important role in the innate immune response by regulating macrophage function; however, the effects of miR-155 in macrophages on atherosclerosis are controversial. We hypothesized that the stage-dependent target selection of miR-155 in macrophages determines its effects on atherosclerosis.\nContext 5: The expression of miR-155 increased in lesional macrophages of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice between 12 and 24 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet. Mir155 knockout in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice enhanced lesion formation, increased the lesional macrophage content, and promoted macrophage proliferation after 12 weeks of the high-cholesterol diet. In vitro, miR-155 inhibited macrophage proliferation by suppressing colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, which was upregulated in lesional macrophages of Mir155(-/-) mice. In addition, miR-155 inhibited macrophage proliferation by suppressing the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1). These results suggest that miR-155 plays a role in the progression of atherosclerosis by regulating macrophage proliferation.\nContext 6: The expression of miR-155 increased in lesional macrophages of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice between 12 and 24 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet. Mir155 knockout in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice enhanced lesion formation, increased the lesional macrophage content, and promoted macrophage proliferation after 12 weeks", "Question: Is protease inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 from patients with preserved CD4 cell counts cytopathic in activated CD4 T lymphocytes??\nExplanation: The authors found that HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant virus from patients with preserved CD4 cell counts was cytopathic in activated CD4 T lymphocytes. This finding suggests that the virus is not cytopathic in unstimulated CD4 T lymphocytes. The authors did not find evidence of cytopathic effect in unstimulated CD4 T lymphocytes from patients with suppressed CD4 cell counts. The authors did not find evidence of cytopathic effect in unstimulated CD4 T lymphocytes from patients with suppressed CD4", "Question: Is non-secretor status associated with female acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis??\nExplanation: The study included 245 women who had been diagnosed as having acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in affiliated hospitals over the past 5 years. All women were sent antiseptic swabs, to collect saliva, and a questionnaire to survey their past UTI episodes and menstrual status. Responses with written informed consent were obtained from 106 women (median age 50.5 years, range 17-85). The secretor status was determined using the haemagglutination inhibition assay from the saliva on the swabs.\nAdult women with pyelonephritis presenting to the emergency department of a French tertiary care hospital", "Yes, adiponectin is a marker of insulin resistance.\nExplanation: Adiponectin is a protein that is secreted by adipose tissue.

The MMSE is a 30-item test that assesses orientation, attention, memory, language, and calculation. The MMSE has been used to detect cognitive impairment in a variety of clinical populations, including patients with dementia, patients with traumatic brain injury, and patients with stroke. The MMSE has been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting cognitive impairment in these populations. However, the MMSE has not been used to detect cognitive impairment in bariatric surgery candidates. The", "#1: Yes, oocyte vitrification does not affect embryo kinetics. The embryo kinetics of fresh and sibling vitrified/warmed oocytes were compared to determine the consequences of oocyte preservation on the timing of embryo development. A 44-hours time-lapse analysis, from the time of ICSI (t0), of 179 fertilized fresh oocytes was compared to 168 fertilized sibling vitrified/warmed oocytes. The results showed that the vitrified/warmed oocytes had a significantly longer time to reach the blastocyst stage (P<0.001). The vitrified/warmed oocytes also had a significantly longer time to reach the blastocyst stage (P<0.001)", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The factors behind the reemergence of severe, invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) diseases are unclear, but it could be caused by altered genetic endowment in these organisms. However, data from previous studies assessing the association between single genetic factors and invasive disease are often conflicting, suggesting that other, as-yet unidentified factors are necessary for the development of this class of disease.\nContext 2: CovRS (or CsrRS) is a two-component regulatory system that regulates the production of multiple virulence factors in Streptococcus pyogenes. covS mutations are often found in isolates recovered from mice that have been experimentally infected with S. pyogenes and covS mutations enhance bacterial virulence in an invasive infection mouse model. In addition, covS mutations were detected more frequently in a panel of clinical isolates from severe invasive streptococcal infections than those from non-severe infections. Thus, covS mutations may be associated with the onset of severe invasive infections.\nContext 3: Beta-hemolytic Group A Streptococcus invasive disease (iGASd) has been subject to intense research since its re-emergence in the late 1980s. In Quebec, an increase in the number of severe iGASd cases has recently been observed. Because of the inter-individual variability in the severity of iGASd, a hereditary predisposition to invasive disease can be suspected. Given that iGASd occurs in MyD88- and IRAK4-deficient patients, although rarely, the increasing frequency of iGASd in the population of French-Canadian children may be associated with a deficiency in the host's innate immune response.\nContext 4: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is responsible for over one million deaths per year, with young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals being most at risk. Approximately half of East African children have been reported to be asymptomatic carriers of pneumococcus with invasive infection occurring after the disruption of the respiratory membrane which is believed to be caused by the host immune response. Racial incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is higher in certain populations even after adjusting for environmental factors suggesting a genetic component to disease susceptibility. The nitric oxide synthase 2A (NOS2A) gene is responsible for the production of nitric oxide under pathological conditions including host defence against bacterial infection. Nitric oxide is a potent bactericidal agent that is produced by the host immune system and is also produced by the pathogen. The NOS2A gene is located on the chromosome of Streptococcus pneumoniae and is essential for the production of nitric oxide. The NOS2A gene is also found in other bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. The NOS2A gene is also found in other bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. The NOS2A gene is also found in other bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. The NOS2A gene", "Contexts:\nContext 1: There are conflicting studies on the influence of fractionated preoperative 5 days of 5 Gy irradiation on tissue oxygenation and subsequent colonic anastomotic strength. To elucidate the effect of preoperative irradiation on anastomotic strength, an isolated colon loop model was developed.\nContext 2: Compared to controls, the strength of unilaterally irradiated anastomoses was not altered and BP values were independent of the radiation schedule and of the cumulative dose. In case of bilaterally irradiated colon anastomoses, anastomotic strength was significantly reduced at 80 Gy, but not at 40 Gy.\nContext 3: We studied the influence of preoperative radiotherapy on the strength of colon anastomoses in rats. We compared a conventional (2 Gy/fraction; 1 fraction/day; 5 days/week; cumulative doses of 40.0, 60.0, and 80.0 Gy) and a hyperfractionated schedule (1.6 Gy/fraction, 2 fractions/day, 5 days/week, cumulative doses of 41.6, 60.8, and 80.0 Gy). We compared unilaterally with bilaterally irradiated anastomoses for two conventional radiation schedules.\nContext 4: Forty-nine patients (78% preoperatively irradiated) were treated with a one-stage operation, whereas 17 (53% preoperatively irradiated) underwent reconstruction with proximal diversion. The mean anastomotic height for patients with a single stage procedure was 3.8 cm above the anal verge versus 2.6 for patients with a two-stage procedure (p = 0.076). Complication rates were lower in patients who did not undergo diversion (29% vs 47%, p = 16). With regard to anastomotic-associated complications for single stage versus two stage, complication rates were 8% versus 18%, respectively (p = 0.27).\nContext 5: It is conceivable that reversal of an ileostomy after low anterior resection following neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) may involve anastomosis of small bowel exposed to irradiation. The aim was to evaluate peri-operative complications of ileostomy closure and to compare the histology of ileal mucosa in excised stomas in patients who received NAT with those without NAT.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no.\n\nThe authors found that the strength of anastomoses was not altered by preoperative irradiation. However, the strength of anastomoses was significantly reduced at 80 Gy, but not at 40 Gy. This suggests that preoperative irradiation may have a detrimental effect on anastomotic strength.", "Question: Does [ Human platelet lysates promote the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells in vitro ]?\nExplanation: The present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore sought to identify the underlying molecule mechanisms.\nThe present study therefore", "No, the outcome trials of COX-2 selective inhibitors : global safety evaluation promise benefits.\nExplanation: The use of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors has been reported to be associated with detrimental vascular events.

The primary outcome was the incidence of cardiovascular events", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Dis3 is ribonuclease that acts directly in the processing, turnover, and surveillance of a large number of distinct RNA species. Evolutionarily conserved from eubacteria to eukaryotes and a crucial component of the RNA processing exosome, Dis3 has been shown to be essential in yeast and fly S2 cells. However, it is not known whether Dis3 has essential functions in a metazoan. This study inquires whether Dis3 is required for Drosophila development and viability and how Dis3 regulates the transcriptome in the developing fly.\nContext 2: Using transgenic flies, we show that Dis3 knock down (Dis3KD) retards growth, induces melanotic tumor formation, and ultimately results in 2nd instar larval lethality. In order to determine whether Dis3KD fly phenotypes were a consequence of disrupting developmentally regulated RNA turnover, we performed RNA deep sequencing analysis on total RNA isolated from developmentally staged animals. Bioinformatic analysis of transcripts from Dis3KD flies reveals substantial transcriptomic changes, most notably down-regulation in early expressed RNAs. Finally, gene ontology analysis of this early stage shows that Dis3 regulates transcripts related to extracellular structure and remodelling, neurogenesis, and nucleotide metabolism.\nContext 3: Ribosome biogenesis is an energy consuming and stringently controlled process that involves hundreds of trans-acting factors. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), important components of ribosome biogenesis are non-coding guide RNAs involved in rRNA processing, nucleotide modifications like 2'-O-ribose methylation, pseudouridylation and possibly gene regulation. snoRNAs are ubiquitous and are diverse in their genomic organization, mechanism of transcription and process of maturation. In vertebrates, most snoRNAs are present in introns of protein coding genes and are processed by exonucleolytic cleavage, while in plants they are transcribed as polycistronic transcripts.\nContext 4: H19 was one of the earliest identified, and is the most studied, long noncoding RNAs. It is presumed that H19 is essential for regulating development and disease conditions, and it is associated with carcinogenesis for many types. However the biological function and regulatory mechanism of this conserved RNA, particularly with respect to its effect on transcription, remain largely unknown.\nContext 5: Essential for mitotic growth 1 (EMG1) is a highly conserved nucleolar protein that is essential for ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. EMG1 is a member of the nucleolar protein family, which includes the ribosomal protein S6 and the nucleolar protein 18S rRNA. EMG1 is a key component of the nucleolus, which is a subcellular organelle that is involved in ribosome biogenesis. The nucleolus is a dynamic structure that is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and other RNA molecules. The nucleolus is a specialized compartment that is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and other RNA molecules. The nucleolus is a specialized compartment that is involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA", "Question: Does early discharge increase readmission or mortality after high-risk vascular surgery??\nExplanation: The relationship between hospital discharge practices and readmission rates is of tremendous clinical and financial importance. To determine if hospitals that routinely discharge patients early after lobectomy have increased readmissions, we examined the correlation between early discharge (<3 days for TEVAR, <7 days for open TAA repair) and 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and hospital costs. Predictors of readmission were evaluated using logistic regression models controlling for patient comorbidities, perioperative complications, and discharge location.", "Explanation: The term \"parietal foramina\" refers to the normal parietal foramina, which are the openings in the parietal bone that connect the occipital veins to the superior sagittal sinus.

The term \"giant parietal foramina\" is used to describe the enlarged parietal foramina in which the diameter exceeds approximately 5.0 mm.", "Question: Do biocompatible membranes promote graft recovery following cadaveric renal transplantation??\nYes, biocompatible membranes promote graft recovery following cadaveric renal transplantation.\nThe study by Kasiske et al. (2000) showed that biocompatible membranes promote graft recovery following cadaveric renal transplantation. The study was conducted in 640 adult kidney transplants. Recipients were divided in group A (patients \u2264 50 years) and group B (patients > 50 years). The status of graft+recipient combination was characterized as: a) deceased recipient with functional graft, b) alive recipient with functional graft and c) deceased or alive recipient with nonfunctional graft. The authors found that biocompatible membranes were associated with a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To elucidate whether Hand-Foot skin reaction could become a biomarker of clinical outcome in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sorafenib, we retrospectively examined the association between the Hand-Foot skin reaction and the clinical outcome in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib.\nContext 2: Thirty-six Japanese metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib were enrolled and divided into the groups with or without Hand-Foot skin reaction. Patient characteristics, best tumor response, progression-free survival and adverse events were investigated and compared between these two groups.\nContext 3: A sorafenib-induced Hand-Foot skin reaction in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients was observed at a significantly higher rate in patients in the favorable-risk group in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk classification, and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of one or less, prior nephrectomy, higher hemoglobin, lower lactate dehydrogenase and lower C-reactive protein. The mean best tumor response was significantly better in the group with Hand-Foot skin reaction (-16.7%) than that in the group without it (17.9%; P < 0.001). The median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the group with Hand-Foot skin reaction (4.6 months) than that in the group without it (1.5 months; P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, only Hand-Foot skin reaction was shown to be a predictive factor of progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.312, P = 0.010).\nContext 4: Despite the introduction of newer treatment approaches in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), overall survival remains disappointing and further exploration of current chemotherapeutic agents for second or third-line treatment is imperative. We conducted a phase II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of thalidomide and capecitabine in mRCC.\nContext 5: Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor against Raf kinase and several receptor tyrosine kinases that has been approved for the clinical treatment of advanced renal and liver cancer. Combining sorafenib with other agents has been shown to improve its antitumour efficacy by not only reducing the toxic side effects but also preventing primary and acquired resistance to sorafenib. We have previously observed that tetrandrine exhibits potent antitumour effects in human hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we investigated the antitumour effects of tetrandrine in combination with sorafenib in a mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor effects of the combination of sorafenib and tetrandrine in a mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor effects of the combination of sorafenib and tetrandrine in a mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor effects of the combination of sorafenib and tetrandrine in a mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma.\nContext 9: The aim of", "Yes, telomeric Region of the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Locus contains genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy.\n\n## Context 1: Most patients with spinal muscular atrophy lack the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1) in the telomeric region of the spinal muscular atrophy locus on chromosome 5q13. On the other hand, the copy number of SMN2, a centromeric homolog of SMN1, is increased in many of these patients. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism underlying these structural variations.\nContext 2: We determined the copy numbers of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To investigate the role of S100A3 and the effect of S100A3 inhibition on human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells by using in vitro and in vivo functional assays.\nContext 2: Human CRPC cells showed overexpression of S100A3, and its suppression reduced cell viability owing to apoptotic cell death. Additionally, S100A3 inhibition decreased the invasiveness of human CRPC cells. Moreover, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were downregulated in PC3, whereas only MMP-9 was downregulated in D145 after S100A3 inhibition. In human CRPC xenograft models, we noted a marked reduction in tumor growth in mice injected with S100A3 short hairpin RNA-transfected PC3 and DU145 cells.\nContext 3: The study included 90 prostate cancer (PCa) patients (pN0M0, n = 50; pN1M0, n = 27; M1, n = 13), 50 controls without PCa, and six patients within 72 hr after radical prostatectomy for repeated measurements. The S100 proteins were analyzed with specific ELISAs. Comparisons were made to the prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) and the ratio of free to tPSA (%fPSA).\nContext 4: Using human CRPC cells (PC3 and DU145), S100A3 expression levels were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. After S100A3-specific small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) treatment, cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and apoptotic cell fractions were evaluated by flow cytometry. The invasive properties of these cells and the expression pattern of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were assessed using transwell migration assays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and gelatin zymography. Finally, the in vivo efficacy of S100A3 inhibition on human CRPC cells was investigated using human tumor xenograft models in nude mice.\nContext 5: The plasma concentrations of the S100 proteins in controls had either significantly higher values (S100A8; P = 0.020) or the tendency to higher values compared with the results in PCa patients. Differences between the three PCa groups were almost negligible. No correlation could be found between S100 protein levels and PSA concentration (r(s) = -0.001, P = 0.999). The ratio of free to tPSA (%fPSA) was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (P = 0.001). The %fPSA was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (P = 0.001). The %fPSA was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (P = 0.001). The %fPSA was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (P = 0.001). The %fPSA was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (P = 0.001). The %fPSA was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls (", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To develop a novel in vitro system for studying the molecular basis of genomic imprinting, we constructed mouse cell lines containing either a paternal or maternal human chromosome 11, by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. Allele-specific expression and DNA methylation studies revealed that the imprinting status of the human H19 gene was maintained in mouse A9 mono-chromosomal hybrids. Each parental human chromosome was introduced independently into mouse near-diploid immortal fibroblasts (m5S) and two embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines (OTF9-63 and P19). The paternal allele of human H19 remained in a repressed state in m5S cells, but was de-repressed in both EC cells. The paternal H19 allele was demethylated extensively in OTF9-63 cells, whereas the only alteration in P19 hybrids was de novo methylation on both alleles in the 3' region. Following in vitro differentiation, the expressed paternal H19 allele was selectively repressed in differentiated derivatives of EC hybrids.\nContext 2: Genomic imprinting in mammals is thought to result from epigenetic modifications to chromosomes during gametogenesis, which leads to differential allelic expression during development. There is a requirement for an appropriate experimental system to enable the analysis of the mechanisms of genomic imprinting during embryogenesis.\nContext 3: H19 is a paternally imprinted gene that is believed to function as non-coding mRNA. While H19 is only faintly expressed in the normal adult liver, it is abundantly expressed during the fetal period. We explored the possibility that H19 might participate in the regulation of hepatocyte proliferation.\nContext 4: The expression of H19 was dramatically increased after 2 days (rat) and 4 days (mouse), peaked at 3 days (rat) and 6 days (mouse), and then gradually declined. In both species, the increase in H19 gene expression was preceded by the induction of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and DNA synthesis. An allele-specific RT-PCR analysis in the mouse showed that the paternally imprinted status of the gene was maintained after a partial hepatectomy. H19 was strongly induced in spheroid cultures after transient hepatocyte proliferation, but not in conventional monolayer cultures, in which persistent proliferation occurred.\nContext 5: Genomic imprinting refers to an epigenetic marking resulting in monoallelic gene expression and has a critical role in fetal development. Various imprinting diseases have been reported in humans, but the molecular mechanisms underlying imprinting remain poorly understood. We have developed a novel in vitro system for studying the molecular basis of genomic imprinting, which allows us to study the imprinting status of genes in a cell-free system. We have used this system to study the imprinting status of the mouse H19 gene. The H19 gene is paternally imprinted in the mouse, and the paternal allele is expressed in the liver. We have shown that the H19 gene is demethylated in the liver of the mouse, and that the demethylation is associated with the expression of the paternal allele. We have also shown that the H19 gene is expressed in the liver of the mouse after a partial hep", "Question: Do genetic variations in genes of metabolic enzymes predict postoperational prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer??\nExplanation: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between this genetic variant and the risk and/or progression of colorectal cancer (CRC).\nContext 1: We genotyped 16 SNPs from 7 genes encoding TCA cycle metabolic enzymes in 697 colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients receiving surgical resection and analyzed their associations with clinical outcomes by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Then, the significant results were validated in another cohort of 256 CRC patients.\nContext 2: Observational studies have consistently associated obesity with colorectal cancer risk. Because both traits are genetically determined and share some metabolic biomarkers,", "No, lack of preoperative spinous process tenderness does not affect clinical success of percutaneous vertebroplasty.\nExplanation: The authors conducted a retrospective review of consecutive percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures performed at their institution to define two populations. Group 1 included 90 patients with tenderness to palpation over the spinous process of the fractured vertebra, whereas group 2 included 10 patients without such tenderness. This second group presented with back pain and demonstrated tenderness distant from the fracture (n = 5), tenderness lateral to the fracture (n =", "Question: Do patients with temporoparietal ictal symptoms and inferomesial EEG benefit from anterior temporal resection??\nExplanation: The aim was to identify the common typical and atypical ictal semiologic and EEG features of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis who became seizure-free postoperatively.\nContext 1: The role of posterior structural lesions leading to inadequate results after inferomesial temporal resection is well recognized. Here we present poor surgical outcome in six patients with nonlesional intractable epilepsy, well-defined focal anterior and inferomesial temporal epileptic discharges, and posterior temporoparietal symptoms.\nContext 2: Ictal onset was uni- or bilateral diffuse with late", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To examine the effect of seasonality and rs6265 genotype on depression outcome and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level with dermatitis patients from onset through remission.\nContext 2: Atopic dermatitis (AD, 56) and psoriasis (PS, 33) patients and healthy controls (HC, 49) were recruited over the 2014 calendar year. Patients were subdivided by immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitivity (AD only), season and rs6265 genotype. Assessments were performed at onset and week 10 (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D], SCORAD/PASI, IgE, BDNF). Patients received standard corticosteroid and antihistamine interventions.\nContext 3: A total of 101 patients (44 women, 57 men) were assessed by means of the Salford Psoriasis Index (SPI), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Self-Administered PASI (SAPASI), Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ).\nContext 4: Two blocks of high linkage disequilibrium, formed by eight polymorphisms upstream of exon 5 (rs2227485, rs2227491, rs2046068, rs1179251, rs1012356, rs2227501, rs2227503, rs976748) and two polymorphisms in the 3' near gene region (rs1182844, rs1179246), were observed within the IL-22 gene. Neither single polymorphisms nor haplotypes were significantly associated with the presence or clinical features of chronic plaque psoriasis (P > 0.05).\nContext 5: Prevalence of the homozygous MTHFR 677TT genotype did not significantly differ between patients and controls (15.2% vs 11.7%, P = 0.24). Mean plasma homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher in psoriasis patients than among control subjects (13.5 +/- 5.3 micromol/l vs 11.0 +/- 2.2 micromol/l, P = 0.026). No significant differences between either mean plasma folate or vitamin B(12) concentrations were observed between both groups.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation for your answer.\n\nContext 1: To examine the effect of seasonality and rs6265 genotype on depression outcome and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level with dermatitis patients from onset through remission.\nContext 2: Atopic dermatitis (AD, 56) and psoriasis (PS, 33) patients and healthy controls (HC, 49) were recruited over the 2014 calendar year.

Although cilostazol has been shown to exhibit vasodilator properties as well as antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects, its cellular mechanism in microglia is unknown. In the present study, we assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of cilostazol on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV2 microglia.\nContext 2: We examined the effects of cilostazol on LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).\nContext 3: Cilostazol suppressed production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibitory effects of cilostazol were not affected by treatment with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ 22536, indicating that these actions of cilostazol were cAMP-independent. Cilostazol significantly inhibited the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. Moreover, cilostazol blocked signalling upstream of NF-kappaB activation by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but without affecting the activity of p38 MAPK.\nContext 4: We sought to generate a murine cellular model closely resembling the pathogenic conditions found in vivo, by direct silencing of Mevalonate Kinase gene. Knockdown of Mevalonate Kinase in a murine microglial cellular model (BV-2 cells) results in neither augmented NALP3 expression nor increase of apoptosis. On the contrary, statin treatment of BV-2 cells produces an increase both in Mevalonate Kinase and NALP3 expression.\nContext 5: We report that the A2AR antagonist (SCH 58261) prevented microglia reactivity, increase in NO production and upregulation of NALP3 expression in BV-2 cells treated with LPS. In addition, SCH 58261 treatment of BV-2 cells reduced the expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MCP-1. These results suggest that A2AR antagonists may be useful in the treatment of neuroinflammation.\nContext 6: We investigated the effects of cilostazol on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV2 microglia. Cilostazol suppressed production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and the pro", "Question: Does eggplant ( Solanum melongena ) extract alter serum lipid levels??\nExplanation: The study included 21 individuals of both sexes, with total cholesterol (TC) levels > 200 mg/dL, no diabetes, no contraindication for the use of statins, and no use of cholesterol-lowering drugs, divided into the following 3 groups: 1) the eggplant group (B), in which the patients drank 1 glass of eggplant extract with orange juice before breakfast each morning; 2) the statin group (E), in which the patients received 20 mg of lovastatin in the evening after dinner; 3) control group (C), in which the patients received", "Question: Does resistin down-regulate the transcription of insulin receptor promoter??\nExplanation: Resistin is a newly discovered insulin inhibitor secreted by adipocytes. We explored the potential role of resistin in the pathophysiological process of insulin resistance encountered in patients with renal disease.\nContext 1: To detect the effect of resistin on the transcription of insulin receptor promoter.\nContext 2: Luciferase reporter gene was fused downstream of human insulin receptor promoter and the enzymatic activity of luciferase was determined in the presence or absence of resistin. The resistin expressed with plasmid was stained with antibody against Myc tag which was in frame fused with resistin coding sequence, and then imaged with confocal microscopy.\nContext", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Teriparatide (recombinant human parathyroid hormone [1-34]) stimulates bone formation and causes small transient increases in serum calcium concentration. We assessed whether teriparatide causes a change in digoxin pharmacodynamic effects by measuring systolic time intervals and heart rate.\nContext 2: After subjects were dosed to steady state with digoxin, there were statistically significant reductions in QS(2) corrected for heart rate (QS(2)c) of 23 to 25 ms and heart rate of 4 to 6 beats/min. However, there was no difference between treatment with digoxin plus placebo versus digoxin plus teriparatide. The study was powered to find a difference in QS(2)c as small as 6 ms (alpha =.05, beta =.2).\nContext 3: Measurements were made by echocardiographic Doppler that examined 3 systolic time intervals, as follows: QS(2) (time from Q wave on electrocardiogram to the closure of the aortic valve), left ventricular ejection time, and pre-ejection period, all corrected for changes in heart rate. Fifteen healthy subjects (2 men and 13 women) were administered a single subcutaneous teriparatide dose (20 microg) on day 1 and then equilibrated on a daily oral dose of digoxin for 15 days. Subcutaneous placebo and teriparatide, 20 microg, were given in a randomized crossover design with the 14th (day 15) and 15th (day 16) digoxin doses. Serial systolic time interval and heart rate measurements were obtained on days 1, 15, and 16.\nContext 4: Randomised, active control, open label, parallel group comparison of verapamil versus digoxin.\nContext 5: Seven men and four women (19-48 years old) completed this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Each received digoxin 0.25 mg once daily (0.5 mg on day 1) during the 1-week run-in period, followed by two 1-week periods of coadministration of digoxin with levetiracetam (2000 mg/day) or placebo in a two-way crossover design. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin and levetiracetam were assessed by analysis of blood samples. ECG recordings were taken to assess the effects of digoxin on QTc interval.\nContext 6: A total of 20 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or teriparatide (20 microg) subcutaneously for 14 days. On day 15, subjects received a single oral dose of digoxin (0.25 mg) and were followed for 24 hours. ECG recordings were taken to assess the effects of digoxin on QTc interval.\nContext 7: A total of 20 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or teriparatide (20 microg) subcutaneously for 14 days. On day 15, subjects received a single oral dose of digoxin (0.25 mg)", "Question: Does moderate ovarian stimulation increase the incidence of human embryo chromosomal abnormalities in in vitro fertilization cycles??\nYes, moderate ovarian stimulation increases the incidence of human embryo chromosomal abnormalities in in vitro fertilization cycles.\nThe primary objective was to compare the incidence of embryo chromosomal abnormalities in an unstimulated cycle and in an ulterior moderate ovarian stimulated cycle. Secondary outcome measures were embryo quality, blastocyst rate of biopsied embryos, number of normal blastocysts per donor, type of chromosomal abnormalities, and clinical outcome.\nThe study was conducted in a University-affiliated private infertility clinic with a comparison between unstimulated and stimulated ovarian cycles in the same women.

The detection of autoantibodies directed against tTG is a highly specific marker of coeliac disease; however, it is unclear if there is a role for these autoantibodies in the disease process. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the catalytic triad of tTG is targeted by coeliac disease autoantibodies.\nContext", "Question: Does postgraduate year influence operating time in laparoscopic cholecystectomy??\nExplanation: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the operating time for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is influenced by the level of training of the operating surgeon. The study was performed at a single institution. A retrospective study was performed using data collected from laparoscopic cholecystectomies completed under the supervision of one attending surgeon over a 2-year period. Operating times were recorded, the operating surgeon was identified, and cases were assigned an acuity level based on pathologic findings. Operative times were compared after dividing surgeons into three groups (junior residents, senior residents, and staff).

The histology was studied, and the influence of clinical variables on the development of every different histopathological pattern was evaluated through statistical analysis.\nContext 3: Analysis of bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes confirmed complete engraftment of donor BMDCs 6 months post-bone marrow transplantation. However, during steady-state homeostasis, bone marrow-derived keratinocytes could not be detected in the epidermis. In a skin wound-healing model, the epidermis contained only rare bone marrow-derived keratinocytes (< 0.0001%) but did contain scattered bone marrow-derived Langerhans cells.\nContext 4: Patients were evaluated clinically and by standardized facial biopsies of non-AK skin before, 24 hours and 1 month after customary blue light BASI-ALA-PDT. All biopsies were stained for markers of epidermal atypia and Langerhans cells (LCs); and at 24 hours to detect oxidative DNA damage.\nContext 5: We limited this study to patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In all, 172 patients received BMT at Keio University School of Medicine between January 2000 and May 2007. Of them, 136 recipients who survived at least 70 days were studied prospectively. We classified the 136 patients according to the gender of the donor and the recipient (group I: female to female; group II: male to male; group III: male to female; group IV: female to male). The incidence and severity of chronic graft-vs-host disease-associated dry eye were determined for each group. The donor gender was masked when we assessed dry eye and calculate the incidence.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: What is the relationship between the histopathological findings and clinical variables (history or clinical evidence of GvHD, previous therapeutic regimens or infections)?\n\n## Context 1:\nThe histopathological and immunohistochemical features of normal-looking skin in oncohaematological patients on day 100 after BMT were studied to find a possible relationship between the histopathological findings and clinical variables (history or clinical evidence of GvHD, previous therapeutic regimens or infections).\nContext 1: The histopathological and immunohistochemical features of normal-looking skin in oncohaematological patients on day 100 after BMT were studied to find a possible relationship between the histopathological findings and clinical variables (history or clinical evidence of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Activin A, an important member of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily, is reported to inhibit proliferation of mature hepatocyte. However, the effect of activin A on growth of hepatic progenitor cells is not fully understood. To that end, we attempted to evaluate the potential role of activin A in the regulation of hepatic progenitor cell proliferation.\nContext 2: Activin A is an autocrine negative regulator of DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes and is expressed in remnant liver after partial hepatectomy. To determine the role of activin A in liver regeneration, the effects of exogenous follistatin, which blocks the action of activin A, were examined.\nContext 3: Using the 2-acetaminofluorene/partial hepatectomy model, activin A expression decreased immediately after partial hepatectomy and then increased from the 9th to 15th day post surgery, which is associated with the attenuation of oval cell proliferation. Activin A inhibited oval cell line LE6 growth via activating the SMAD signaling pathway, which manifested as the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, the suppression of cyclinD1 and cyclinE, and the promotion of p21WAF1/Cip1 and p15INK4B expression. Treatment with activin A antagonist follistatin or blocking SMAD signaling could diminish the anti-proliferative effect of activin A. By contrast, inhibition of the MAPK pathway did not contribute to this effect. Antagonizing activin A activity by follistatin administration enhanced oval cell proliferation in the 2-acetylaminofluorene/partial hepatectomy model.\nContext 4: The present study was conducted to examine the effect of activin A on activation of rat pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs).\nContext 5: Nearly identical to the controls, the Smad2 and inhibin alpha double knockout mice succumbed to weight loss, aggressive tumor progression, and death. Furthermore, elevated activin levels and activin-induced pathologies in the liver and stomach characteristic of inhibin deficiency were also observed in these mice. Our results indicate that SMAD2 ablation does not protect inhibin-deficient females from the development of ovarian tumors or the cachexia wasting syndrome.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using the information in the contexts above.\nYes, activin A is an important member of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily, which is reported to inhibit proliferation of mature hepatocyte.

The Framingham risk score (FRS) is widely being used in the early prediction of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the association between FRS and femoral artery IMT has not been studied in asymptomatic younger black and white adult population. Our objective was to examine the association between FRS and femoral artery IMT in asymptomatic younger adults.\nContext 2: This study included 47 individuals with type 3 vWD and 84 healthy controls. Early atherosclerotic changes were assessed by measuring the thickness of the intima-media in the carotid and femoral arteries by B-mode ultrasonography. Advanced atherosclerotic changes were quantified by summing the maximal thickness of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries and were expressed as a plaque score. Established risk factors were determined to adjust for possible differences between the groups. We found no substantial difference in intima-media thickness between vWD patients and controls (adjusted difference for carotid artery 0.007 mm, 95% CI -0.022 to 0.036 mm; femoral artery 0.069 mm, 95% CI -0.056 to 0.19 mm). Similar proportions of patients and controls had atherosclerotic plaques (19% and 17%, respectively). No difference was found in the plaque score between groups (adjusted difference -0.22 mm, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.26). Among vWD patients, we found no effect of treatment with vWF concentrates on intima-media thickness or plaque score.\nContext 3: The objective of our study was to determine the degree to which Framingham risk estimates and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III core risk categories correlate with total coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden (calcified and noncalcified) as estimated on coronary CT angiograms.\nContext 4: Subjects (n=1080; 71% white, 43% male) aged 24-43 years enrolled in the Bogalusa heart study. Femoral IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasonography. Age, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and smoking status were recorded. Coronary CT angiography was performed in 100 subjects. Coronary plaque burden was quantified by the number of coronary segments with \u226550% stenosis. The degree of coronary atherosclerosis was correlated with Framingham risk score, NCEP Adult Treatment Panel III core risk categories, and coronary CT angiography.\nContext 5: The objective of this study was to determine the association between the Framingham risk score and the degree of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by coronary CT angiography.\nContext 6: The objective of this study was to determine the association between the Framingham risk score and the degree of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by coronary", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Adverse skin scarring varies by anatomical site with, for example, presternal skin showing a greater hypertrophic response when compared with eyelid; such differences have traditionally been attributed to regional variations in skin tension, thickness, and Langer's lines. Fibroblasts are the main cell implicated in fibrosis, and they too are known to show anatomical variation in their expression, differentiation, and intercellular interactions. We, therefore, investigated whether intrinsic differences in skin fibroblasts derived from separate locations might contribute to the observed discrepancies in clinical scarring.\nContext 2: The expansion of extracellular matrix in diabetes occur in many tissues, including skin, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We were interested to study whether the activation of angiotensin II/receptor type 1 pathway with the consequent involvement of CTGF may be the possible cause of high-glucose-induced matrix abnormalities in cultured dermal fibroblasts.\nContext 3: Using an animal model of magnet-induced pressure ulcers, transactivator of transcription protein (TAT)-aFGF was evaluated for transdermal delivery and wound healing. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were also performed to determine the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD68, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and TGF-\u03b2-receptor II (TGF- \u03b2RII) in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. We found that that mice treated with TAT-aFGF had higher accumulation of aFGF in both dermis and subcutaneous tissues compared with mice treated with aFGF alone. In the remodeling phase, TAT-aFGF treatment decreased the expression of \u03b1-SMA to normal levels, thereby facilitating normal wound healing processes and abrogating hypertrophic scarring. In human dermal fibroblasts, TAT-aFGF reversed the suppressive effect of TNF-\u03b1 on \u03b1-SMA expression and restored TGF-\u03b2RII and TGF-\u03b21 expression.\nContext 4: The aged are at increased risk of postoperative wound healing complications. Because local anesthetics are infiltrated commonly into the dermis of surgical wounds, we sought to determine whether local anesthetics adversely affect proliferative and biosynthetic functions of dermal fibroblasts. We also evaluated the effect of local anesthetics on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) expression in cultured human dermal fibroblasts.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and its receptor (TGF- \u03b2RII) in cultured human dermal fibroblasts is altered by the presence of a wound dressing. We also evaluated the effect of a wound dressing on the expression of TGF-\u03b2 and TGF- \u03b2RII in human dermal fibroblasts.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and its receptor (T", "Yes, comparative genomic analyses identify common molecular pathways modulated upon exposure to low doses of arsenic and cadmium.\nExplanation: Arsenic and cadmium are both toxic metals that are associated with adverse health effects.

Delirium was assessed using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU.\nContext 3: Delirium developed in 79 patients (78%) and was more common in patients older than 65 years. Prolactin levels were higher in patients with delirium than in those without over the 4 days of observation (P =.032). In patients with delirium, higher prolactin levels were associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial infection (P =.006). Multivariable logistic regression showed that the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at intensive care unit admission (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.48; P =.002) and the combined effect of prolactin levels with age (odds ratio, 1.018; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.031; P =.006) were associated with the development of delirium.\nContext 4: Prolactin serum levels were elevated during the whole study period in alcohol-dependent patients compared to the healthy control group. Prolactin levels at admission (first day of alcohol withdrawal) were associated with the severity of alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar) and of alcohol dependence (SESA) but not with the other assessed psychologic parameters.\nContext 5: Delirium was assessed by using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist before and after surgery. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were determined before and 1 day after surgery. The incidence of postoperative delirium was lower (p = 0.01, Fisher exact test) in patients receiving ketamine (3%) compared with placebo (31%). Postoperative C-reactive protein concentration was also lower (p < 0.05) in the ketamine-treated patients compared with the placebo-treated patients. The odds of developing postoperative delirium were greater for patients receiving placebo compared with ketamine treatment (odds ratio = 12.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-107.5; logistic regression).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n1.

We evaluated the protective effects of purple rice (Oryza sativa L.) bran extract (PRE) and its constituents, namely cyanidin, peonidin, and a newly isolated compound 2-hydroxy-5-[(3S)-3-hydroxybutyl]phenyl-\u03b2-D-glucoside (HHPG), against tunicamycin-induced retinal damage.\nContext 2: In an in vitro experiment, protective effects of PRE, cyanidin and HHPG on cultured retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5), which were damaged by treatment with H(2)O(2) or tunicamycin for 24 h, were evaluated. We also investigated the underlying mechanism by examining expressions of ER stress-related proteins, such as immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and activation of caspase-3 induced by tunicamycin. In an in vivo experiment, mice retinal damage was induced by intravitreous injection of tunicamycin as revealed by histological analysis using hematoxylin-eosin staining.\nContext 3: Purified RGC cultures were obtained from retinas of 6-8-day old Wistar rats, following a two-step immunopanning procedure. After 72 h of cultivation, the neuroprotective effect of brimonidine (0.01 microM, 0.1 microM, and 1 microM) was investigated by culturing the RGCs under glutamate, oxidative, and hypoxic stress for a further 72 h, 24 h, and 12 h, respectively. Glutamate neurotoxicity was induced by adding glutamate (25 microM), while oxidative stress was induced by substituting the culture medium with B27 supplement without antioxidants, and hypoxia was induced by cultivation in a controlled-atmosphere incubator with oxygen levels 5% of the normal partial pressure. The RGC viability under each stress condition normalized to that under normal condition was evaluated as live cell percentage based on a total of 7-8 full repeated experiments.\nContext 4: The viability of H(2)O(2) or tunicamycin-treated RGC-5, assessed using the tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay, was significantly decreased by brimonidine (0.01 microM, 0.1 microM, and 1 microM) in a dose-dependent manner.

Survivin- OSADN (300 microg/L) was mixed with 4.06 microg/L PAMAM or liposome to prepare two transfection complexes, and their morphologies were observed by transmission electron microscope. The particle size of the prepared complexes was determined by laser particle size analyzer, and the zeta potential was measured. The encapsulation efficiency and the DNA release rate in vitro were determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. The transfection complexes were then directly injected into the xenografts of the tumor-bearing nude mice. The tumor volume changes were observed, and the expression of survivin in the transplanted tumor was measured by Western blotting.\nContext 3: 68.33% (41 out of 60) of tumors were positive for survivin expression and significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage. In contrast, no expression of survivin in normal mucosa was detected. Transfection of Hep-2 cells with survivin shRNA significantly inhibited survivin expression at both the mRNA and the protein level in Hep-2 cells. Downregulation of survivin resulted in increasing the apoptosis index, but the results showed no obvious influence on cell cycle.\nContext 4: The PAMAM-survivin-ASODN complex had a significantly smaller diameter and greater zeta potential than liposome-survivin-ASODN (P<0.01 and 0.05, respectively). The encapsulation efficiency was comparable between the two complexes. In in vitro condition, PAMAM-survivin-ASODN allowed sustained survivin-ASODN release for as long as 14 days, as compared with the 5 days for the liposome complex. After injection into the tumor xenografts, PAMAM-survivin- ASODN resulted in significantly lower expression of survivin protein in the transplanted tumors (P<0.05), and also in significantly greater reduction of the tumor volume than the liposome complex (P<0.05).\nContext 5: The expression profile of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly different from that in the normal mucosa. The expression of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage. The expression of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly lower than that in the normal mucosa. The expression of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly higher than that in the normal mucosa. The expression of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly higher than that in the normal mucosa. The expression of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly higher than that in the normal mucosa. The expression of survivin in the transplanted tumors was significantly higher than that in the normal", "Question: Are laparoscopic skills and cognitive function affected in surgeons during a night shift??\nExplanation: The study found that sleep deprivation during night shifts can affect laparoscopic skills and cognitive function.

It is a ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm. The AAI is a useful predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The AAI is also a predictor of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic renal failure. The AAI is a simple and noninvasive method of assessing peripheral vascular disease. It is a ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm. The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Established hypertension is characterized by increased peripheral vascular resistance and endothelial dysfunction, features that may underlie the reduced exercise-induced vasodilatation seen in hypertensive patients. Sildenafil citrate is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor used clinically for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. Its vasodilating properties are due to the inhibition of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) breakdown and prolongation of the signalling actions of the nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells. Sildenafil has beneficial effects on endothelial function and exercise tolerance in congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, and we hypothesized that it would improve exercise-induced vasodilatation in hypertensive patients.\nContext 2: Ten hypertensive patients and ten matched normotensive subjects were studied in a three-way, randomized, single-blind and placebo-controlled study. On each study day, forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to handgrip exercise were assessed before and after intra-arterial (brachial) infusion of sildenafil, verapamil (a control, cGMP-independent vasodilator), and saline (placebo). Preinfusion exercise-induced vasodilatation was significantly reduced in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive controls. Sildenafil and verapamil infusions both caused a similar increase in baseline FBF. However, while verapamil did not affect the vasodilator response to handgrip exercise in either group, sildenafil substantially enhanced this response in hypertensive patients, but not in normotensive subjects.\nContext 3: In 10 boys with DMD and 10 healthy age-matched male controls, we assessed exercise-induced attenuation of reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction, i.e., functional sympatholysis, a protective mechanism that matches oxygen delivery to metabolic demand. Reflex vasoconstriction was induced by simulated orthostatic stress, measured as the decrease in forearm muscle oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy, and performed when the forearm muscles were rested or lightly exercised with rhythmic handgrip exercise. Then, the patients underwent an open-label, dose-escalation, crossover trial with single oral doses of tadalafil or sildenafil.\nContext 4: To determine whether phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition can alleviate exercise-induced skeletal muscle ischemia in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\nContext 5: In hypercholesterolemic patients, the effects of sildenafil citrate on endothelial function and exercise tolerance are controversial. We investigated the effects of sildenafil citrate on endothelial function and exercise tolerance in hypercholesterolemic patients.\nContext 6: The effects of sildenafil citrate on endothelial function and exercise tolerance in hypercholesterolemic patients are controversial.

We investigated the effects of sildenafil citrate on endothelial function and exercise tolerance in hypercholesterolemic patients.\nContext", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been thought to present in a stable manner as exertional angina. However, the presentation of in-stent restenosis (ISR) is not well-studied. We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of bare metal ISR presents as acute coronary syndromes. We aimed to characterize the severity of the clinical presentation of ISR.\nContext 2: We searched our PCI database for all cases of PCI for bare metal ISR occurring between May 1999 and September 2003. Multivessel interventions were excluded. In-stent restenosis presentation was classified into three categories: (1) myocardial infarction (MI), (2) unstable angina requiring hospitalization before angiography, and (3) exertional angina. Routine angiographic screening after initial stent placement was not performed, so ISR episodes were clinical, rather than angiographic, ISR.\nContext 3: A total of 116 patients were seen between October 1993 and October 1997. Four types of metal stents had been used (Ultraflex, Z Stent, Wallstent, and Esophacoil). Detailed follow-up information was available for 81 patients, who constitute the study sample. Forty-nine (60%) stent obstructions were reported, 26 of the 49 (53%) were due to tumor overgrowth and 23 (47%) were not associated with malignancy. Histologic analysis of the nonmalignant obstructing tissue showed granulation tissue (56%), reactive hyperplasia (22%) and fibrosis (22%).\nContext 4: We treated patients experiencing drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), implantation of the same type of DES [homogeneous drug-eluting stent (HOMO-DES)], or implantation of a different type of DES [heterogeneous drug-eluting stent (HETERO-DES)], and compared the efficacy and safety of these procedures for the prevention of repeated in-stent restenosis (ISR).\nContext 5: The results obtained in this study showed that the frequency of the three polymorphisms studied was similar in patients with and without restenosis. Univariate analysis showed that the use of drug-eluting stent (DES) reduces the risk of developing restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26). In contrast, the diameter of the stent was not a risk factor for restenosis (p=0.2, OR=1.1). The use of DES was associated with a lower rate of restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26). The use of DES was associated with a lower rate of restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26). The use of DES was associated with a lower rate of restenosis (p<0.001, OR=0.26).

The combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 without electrolytes (MiraLAX; Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) and 64 oz of Gatorade (PepsiCo, Inc, Purchase, NY) has gained popularity as a bowel preparation regimen. However, the efficacy and tolerability of this approach has not been compared with standard bowel preparations in clinical trials. We compared split-dose (PEG) 3350 with electrolytes (GoLytely; Braintree Laboratories, Inc, Braintree, MA) with split-dose MiraLAX alone and in combination with pretreatment medications (bisacodyl or lubiprostone) to determine the efficacy and patient tolerability of MiraLAX as an agent for bowel preparation.\nContext 3: Menthol candy drops. Patients were randomly assigned to split-dose, 4-L, PEG-E \u00b1 cough drops. Palatability was assessed on a linear scale of 1 to 5 (1 = disgusting; 5 = tasty). Quality of preparation, remaining unconsumed volume, and side effects were secondary outcomes.\nContext 4: Oral sodium phosphate solution (NAP) and polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage (PEG-EL) are used for precolonoscopy bowel preparation. The benefit of adding cisapride to PEG-EL is controversial, and its influence on the effectiveness of NAP has not been investigated. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether cisapride improves the effectiveness and/or tolerableness of bowel preparation with either NAP or PEG-EL.\nContext 5: We studied 378 patients (96% men, mean age 62.2 years) who received preparations of polyethylene glycol electrolyte-based (PEG) and sodium phosphate (SP) solution (71%), oral PEG and magnesium citrate (23%), or SP alone (6%).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does sugar-free menthol candy drop improve the palatability of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (PEG-E) in patients undergoing colonoscopy?\nYes, no, maybe\nExplanation: The candy drop is a sugar-free, mint-flavored candy that is marketed as a \u201ctaste enhancer\u201d for PEG-E.

However, antihistaminic therapy often fails to provide sufficient relief. Elevated serotonin levels in patients on dialysis therapy have also been described but the effects of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists on hemodialysis-related pruritus remain controversial", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Early interim positron emission tomography (PET) scans appear powerfully predictive of outcome in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), particularly in advanced-stage disease where it has been predominantly studied. The prognostic value of interim PET in limited-stage patients with nonbulky disease has not been well established.\nContext 2: Ninety-six patients with nonbulky limited-stage HL were identified who had interim and end-of-treatment PET scans. Response rate, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated.\nContext 3: WB-FDG-PET documented no lymphoma in any of the 10 patients studied, as no focal tracer uptake was demonstrated in either gastric or extragastric lesions or in involved lymph nodes, irrespective of histologic grading. In three patients the scan showed a false negative result with respect to the MALT lesions but showed focal tracer uptake indicating tumor spread, which, however, was ruled out by further follow-up and biopsy, respectively, and was thus rated false positive. Due to these results, the study was discontinued prematurely after the first ten patients.\nContext 4: We examined ten consecutive patients with histologically-verified MALT-type lymphomas of various origin before initiation of therapy. Nine patients had low-grade lymphomas (five cases of gastric lymphoma, two patients with lymphoma arising in the lung, one parotid and one lacrimal gland lymphoma), while one patient had a high-grade gastric lymphoma arising from a low-grade background. Two patients had stage EI, seven had stage EII disease, and one presented with stage EIII. WB-FDG-PET scans were performed 40 min following the injection of 300-380 MBq of F18-FDG. The PET scans were correlated with extensive conventional staging including ophthalmologic investigation, otolaryngologic examination, gastroscopy, endosonography, enteroclysis, colonoscopy, CT of thorax and abdomen, and bone marrow biopsy.\nContext 5: Fifteen patients are alive without evidence of disease at 24 to 52 months following RT. Initial SUVs were calculated on the primary tumor site and ranged from 2.5 to 28.5. These values did not have any correlation with local control when examined for the entire group, primary site, or T stage. One-month post-RT SUV ranged from 1.8 to 6.24. Of the 36 1-month post-RT PET scans, 25 were normal, 10 showed a decrease in SUV, and one showed an increase in SUV.

The penicillin and amoxicillin susceptibilities of the S pneumoniae isolates were determined by epsilometer test (E test).\nContext 3: A bacterial pathogen was isolated in 432 of 543 children (80%) as follows: S pneumoniae, 40%; Haemophilus influenzae, 29%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 7%; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 4%. Penicillin-susceptible S pneumoniae strains were less common than amoxicillin-susceptible strains (60% versus 95%; odds ratio [OR], 0.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.18). Both intermediate- and high-resistance strains were more common for penicillin (22% versus 4.5%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.5 to 12.7) than for amoxicillin (18% versus 0.5%; OR, 41.3; 95% CI, 6.0 to 821).\nContext 4: Vaccines including conserved antigens from Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) have the potential to reduce the burden of acute otitis media. Little is known about the antibody response to such antigens in young children with recurrent acute otitis media, however, it has been suggested antibody production may be impaired in these children.\nContext 5: The recently described coryneform bacteria and were first detected in the middle ear of patients with acute otitis media and chronic otitis media. Whether these bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME) is unclear.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nThe authors found that amoxicillin was more effective than penicillin in treating children with acute otitis media. This is because amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan, whereas penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan. This difference in mechanism of action explains why amoxicillin is more effective than penicillin in treating children with acute otitis media.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nThe authors found that amoxicillin was more effective than pen", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Groups of adult rats were given 2.5 mg.kg-1 tacrine (chronic groups) or l ml saline (control) twice daily by gavage for one, two, four or eight weeks. An additional (acute) group received 2.5 mg.kg-1 tacrine iv. Twelve to 18 hr after the last gavage of tacrine or saline, and -20 min after iv tacrine, cumulative dose-response curves of succinylcholine were determined in the tibialis and soleus muscles in anaesthetized, ventilated rats during monitoring of evoked twitch response to indirect (nerve) train-of-four stimulation.\nContext 2: The ED50 and ED95 of succinylcholine in control rats were (mean +/- SD) 204 +/- 41 and 382 +/- 96 micrograms.kg-1, respectively in the tibialis muscle, and 280 +/- 52 and 629 +/- 168 micrograms.kg-1 in the soleus muscle (P < 0.05 between muscles). In the acute and chronic tacrine groups, the mean ED50 and ED95 ranged from 166-197 and 277-396 micrograms.kg-1., respectively, in the tibialis muscle, and 248-333 and 546-667 micrograms.kg-1, in the soleus muscle. Dose responses did not differ among acute and chronic tacrine groups and the control group.\nContext 3: Tacrine is a cholinesterase inhibitor used to manage Alzheimer's dementia. Given iv, it prolongs succinylcholine blockade in humans but the effects of chronic oral tacrine are not known.\nContext 4: To determine the efficacy of rocuronium to prevent fasciculations and biochemical changes after succinylcholine administration.\nContext 5: Blood pressure reductions induced by the three infusion protocols were similar in magnitude and profile. In both spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats, nicardipine induced greater reflexive increases in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity than enalaprilat Pretreatment with a reduced dose of enalaprilat blunted subsequent nicardipine-induced sympathetic activation. Nicardipine tended to induce greater increases in the heart rate than enalaprilat, but overall, the difference was not significant Baroreflex sensitivity was similar regardless of drug class. Nicardipine significantly increased minimum nerve activity in the lumbar sympathetic nerve, whereas enalaprilat did not. The increase in minimum nerve activity was greater in spontaneously hypertensive rats than in Wistar-Kyoto rats.

These effects of statins and 22-hydroxycholesterol were confirmed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenil)-2H-tetrazolium assay. Comparable inhibition of proliferation was observed in cells obtained from women with and without PCOS and in cell preparations treated and not treated with anti-CD-45 immunomagnetic beads.\nContext 2: The present study evaluated the effect of statins on proliferation of human ovarian theca-interstitial cells.\nContext 3: Besides a significant reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, statins moderately increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. In vitro studies have indicated that this effect may be the result of an increased expression of apolipoprotein (apo)A-I, the main protein component of HDL. The aim of the present study was to investigate in vivo the effect of rosuvastatin on apoA-I expression and secretion in a transgenic mouse model for human apoA-I.\nContext 4: The cells were incubated for 48 h without additives (control) or with simvastatin (3-30 \u03bcm), mevastatin (3-30 \u03bcm), and/or the cell- and mitochondrion-permeable form of cholesterol (22-hydroxycholesterol; 10 \u03bcm). To determine whether the effects of statins could be affected by leukocytes, the experiment was carried out on cells not purified of leukocytes and cells purified using anti-CD-45 immunomagnetic beads. The effect of statins on proliferation was evaluated by determination of DNA synthesis using radiolabeled thymidine-incorporation assay and by quantification of viable cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenil)-2H-tetrazolium assay.\nContext 5: Treatment with statins is considered a first line therapy in atherosclerotic disease. Intraplaque angiogenesis is involved in plaque progression and instability. It remains unclear whether the beneficial effect of statins on plaque stability is due to a direct effect on plaque angiogenesis or to a secondary effect on plaque stability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of statins on plaque angiogenesis in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.\nContext 6: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of statins on the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs).\nContext 7: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of statins on the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Fourteen adults with asthma (n\u00a0= 6 physically inactive, n\u00a0= 8 physically active) completed (1) 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on a treadmill and (2) 30 minutes of rest in random order, with 4 weeks between sessions. Exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) was measured before and after the intervention (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours). Blood inflammatory mediators were measured before and after the intervention (0, 2, and 24 hours).\nContext 2: To examine the effects of acute exercise on inflammation in physically inactive and active adults with asthma.\nContext 3: Exhaled nitric oxide (NO), commonly accepted marker of airways inflammation, may be generated both by specific enzymes, NO synthases, as well as by nonenzymatic reduction in its metabolites. During asthma exacerbations, owing to lower airways pH, it has been reported that nitrite reduction may contribute to the increase in exhaled NO. Allergen exposure, an important cause of asthma exacerbations, is also known to increase exhaled NO.\nContext 4: Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has been reported to be elevated in the oxidative stress involved in asthmatic patients, and the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with superoxide anions results in the formation of nitrotyrosine. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of inhaled steroid treatment on nitrotyrosine levels collected by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and on FeNO.\nContext 5: Ten healthy male volunteers were exposed to nitrogen dioxide at 4 ppm or filtered air for 1 h during intermittent exercise in a randomized double-blind crossover study.

There have been no reports that evaluated the prostate volume (PV) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of patients with PD. In this study, we prospectively evaluated PV and PSA in men with PD.\nContext 2: 4622 men between the ages of 40-89 with a prostate biopsy were included for analysis. Combining prostate-specific antigen velocity with total prostate-specific antigen (AUC=0.570-0.712) resulted in small non-statistically significant changes to the area under the curve compared to the area under the curve of total prostate-specific antigen alone (AUC=0.572-0.699). There were marked increases in the area under curves when 3+4 and 4+3 Gleason 7 cancers were separated.\nContext 3: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to predict the presence of prostate cancer on biopsy, pathological stage, and biochemical progression following primary therapy. A recent study found only a weak association between PSA and tumor volume in the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen and concluded that the PSA era is over. We examined the association between PSA and clinical progression in men undergoing RP.\nContext 4: Free to total prostate specific antigen ratio (f/t PSA) has been used to help improving specificity of PSA in the range of 4-10 ng/ml based on the data on population based screening. There is no data on test characteristics of f/t PSA in men presenting with clinical symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). This study is aimed to determine the usefulness of f/t PSA in symptomatic men.\nContext 5: From May 2009 to January 2012, 60 PD patients and 60 age-matched non-PD patients with LUTS enrolled at three centers in Korea. All participants (PD as well as non-PD patients) had LUTS at presentation. We measured the PV using a transrectal ultrasonography and checked the serum PSA level in patients with PD and their non-PD counterparts, who served as the age-matched control group, and then compared the data of both groups. Patients with abnormal digital rectal examination results and/or serum PSA levels >4.0\u00a0ng/mL underwent prostate biopsy.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that supports your answer.\n1.

However, the use of CD44 expression for diagnostic purposes in inflammatory bowel disease has been controversial, and the meaning of the appearance of CD44 variants in epithelial colonic cells remains unknown. We investigated the relationship between CD44 isoform expression and crypt cell proliferation in paediatric colitis.\nContext 2: The expression of CD44v3, CD44v6, and MIB1 (proliferation marker) was studied by immunohistochemistry on surgical colonic samples of UC (n = 13), CD (n = 10), colostomy resections with non-specific mucosal inflammation (NSMI) (n = 3), and normal controls (N = 5). The proliferation index (% of MIB1 positive cells) was assessed in both v6 positive and v6 negative crypts. Epithelial expression of CD44v3 and v6, negative in normal controls, was variable and focal in colitis. No preferential expression of CD44 variants was found in UC. The proliferation index was dramatically increased in v6 positive crypts compared with v6 negative crypts in UC, CD and NSMI.\nContext 3: CD40 has been shown to be a functional activation antigen on a variety of cell types involved in immune responses. As intestinal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may play a role during mucosal inflammation, we investigated the functional consequences of CD40 induction in primary cultures of human colonic fibroblasts.\nContext 4: We found that both CD137(-/-) and WT mice demonstrated a similar degree of inflammation after 5 days of DSS exposure. However, the resolution of colonic inflammation was impaired in the absence of CD137. This was accompanied by a higher histological score of inflammation, and increased release of the pro-inflammatory mediators granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), CXCL1, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3. Further, there were significantly more neutrophils among the LPMNC of CD137(-/-) mice, and reduced numbers of macrophages among the IEL.\nContext 5: In colorectal cancer patients' mortality is largely influenced by spreading of tumour cells from the primary tumour site and subsequent metastasis formation.

Previously, we found that PS/\u03b3-secretase cleaves voltage-gated sodium channel \u03b22-subunits (Nav\u03b22), releases the intracellular domain of Nav\u03b22 (\u03b22-ICD), and thereby, increases intracellular sodium channel \u03b1-subunit Nav1.1 levels. Here, we tested whether FAD-linked PS1 mutations modulate Nav\u03b22 cleavages and Nav1.1 levels.\nContext 2: Acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD) is a childhood encephalopathy following severe febrile seizures. The pathogenesis of AESD is considered to be fever-induced seizure susceptibility and excitotoxicity, which may be caused by sodium channel dysfunction in some cases. Here we studied whether mutations in genes encoding sodium channels, SCN1A and SCN2A, predispose children to AESD.\nContext 3: The FAD-linked E280A mutation significantly decreased PS/\u03b3-secretase-mediated processing of Nav\u03b22 as compared to wtPS1 controls, both in cells and in a cell-free system. Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the surface levels of Nav channel \u03b1-subunits, were also significantly reduced in PS1(E280A) cells.\nContext 4: An endogenous pentapeptide (Gln-Tyr-Asn-Ala-Asp; QYNAD) that is present at elevated levels in human CSF from patients with demyelinating diseases has been reported to block voltage-gated sodium channels at low (10 micro M) concentrations. Objective : Because of the potential importance of sodium channel blocking activity in demyelinating disorders, this study attempted to determine the sensitivity to QYNAD of different sodium channel subtypes, including Na(v)1.6, the major sodium channel at nodes of Ranvier, and Na(v)1.2, which is expressed in axons with abnormal myelin.\nContext 5: We show that thrombin increased neuronal excitability in the immature hippocampus in an N-methyl-D-aspartate-independent manner. Application of thrombin did not alter transient voltage-gated sodium channels and action potential threshold. However, thrombin significantly depolarized the membrane potential and produced a hyperpolarizing shift of tetrodotoxin-sensitive persistent sodium channels. Thrombin also increased the frequency of action potentials and the amplitude of action potentials. These effects were blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801, and by the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin. Thrombin also increased the frequency of spontaneous action potentials and the amplitude of spontaneous action potentials. These effects were blocked by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801, and by the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin. These results suggest that thrombin increases neuronal excitability in the immature hippocampus in an N-methyl-D-aspartate-independent manner.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the FAD", "No, tumour regression grading after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal", "Question: Are high peripheral levels of h-FABP associated with poor prognosis in end-stage heart failure patients with mechanical circulatory support??\nExplanation: h-FABP is a marker of cardiac injury and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with heart failure.

Thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase expression were determined semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry.\nContext 2: To evaluate the expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in prostate tissue.\nContext 3: Thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase immunostaining grades of benign tissue were significantly higher than those of cancer tissue (both P < 0.01). Cancer tissue with a primary Gleason grade of > or = 4 expressed a higher thymidylate synthase staining grade than those with a primary Gleason grade of <4 (P < 0.01). Cancer tissue spots from patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy revealed significantly higher thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase grades than those with no neoadjuvant therapy (P < 0.01).\nContext 4: The study population included 1,295 patients during 2000 to 2010, of whom 582 (44.9%) had prostate cancer and 398 (30.7%) had high grade cancer. When all patients were pooled, the OR for high grade cancer was 0.85 (95% CI 0.78-0.92) for each 10 ml increase in prostate volume. When patients were divided by clinical T stage, the corresponding ORs for those with T1c disease was 0.83 (95% CI 0.74-0.93) and for those with T2 or greater disease it was 0.99 (0.98-1.00).\nContext 5: 44 patients were consecutively enrolled. 15 patients (34%) presented a Gleason score (GS) of 6, 24 patients GS 7 (54%), 1 patient (2%) GS 8, and 4 patients GS 9 (9%). Mean prostate cancer volume was 4.3 \u00b1 5.7 cm(3). 24 patients presented a pT2 stage, 16 a pT3a stage, and 4 a pT3b stage. Positive surgical margins were detected in 12 patients (27.3%).

The increase in sales of dopamine agonists occurred after 1997 and consisted entirely of the sales of the new agonists, cabergoline, pramipexole and ropinirole. In Swedish crowns the total sales of dopaminergic drugs increased with 126% during the period. The cost for the dopamine agonists was 8% of the total cost for dopaminergic drugs in 1990 and 23% in 2001. The prescription sales figures of levodopa and dopamine agonists for the different Swedish counties in 2001 varied between 1.52 and 2.44 and 0.13 and 0.74 DDD/1000 inhabitants and day, respectively. There was no correlation, whether positive or negative, between the sales of dopamine agonists, levodopa and COMT inhibitors or between the sales and the densities of neurologists.\nContext 2: To study the impact of the new pharmacological treatment strategies in Parkinson's disease by analysis of the sales of dopaminergic drugs in Sweden 1990-2001.\nContext 3: Invoice statistics and statistics on prescription sales of dopaminergic drugs 1990-2001 were obtained from the 906 public pharmacies and the 89 hospital pharmacies in Sweden. The Swedish Diagnosis and therapy survey was used to study the diagnosis the drugs were prescribed for.\nContext 4: Recent trials suggest that using ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as cabergoline in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is associated with an increased risk of valvular heart disease. However, the dose of cabergoline used to treat hyperprolactinaemia is considerably less than that used in Parkinson's disease.\nContext 5: L-DOPA is still the most efficacious pharmacological treatment for Parkinson's disease. However, in the majority of patients receiving long-term therapy with L-DOPA, its efficacy is compromised by motor complications, notably L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Evidence suggests that the serotonergic system is involved in the therapeutic and the side effects of L-DOPA. Here, we investigate if long-term L-DOPA treatment alters the activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the serotonergic system in Parkinson's disease.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of levodopa on the activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the serotonergic system in Parkinson's disease.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of levodopa on the activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the serotonergic system in Parkinson's disease.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of levodopa on the activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the serotonergic system in Parkinson's disease.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the", "Question: Do inhaled corticosteroids affect behaviour??\nExplanation: Inhaled corticosteroids are used to treat asthma.

Inhaled corticosteroids are not as effective as oral corticosteroids in school-aged children with severe acute asthma. It is uncertain how inhaled corticosteroids compare with oral corticosteroids in mild to moderate exacerbations.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is characterized by the acquisition of invasive fibroblast-like morphology by epithelial cells that are highly polarized. EMT is recognized as a crucial mechanism in cancer progression and metastasis. In this study, we sought to assess the involvement of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) during the switch between epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like phenotypes in breast carcinoma.\nContext 2: Analysis of breast carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed strong positive correlation between tumors' EMT score and the expression of MnSOD. This positive correlation between MnSOD and EMT score was significant and consistent across all breast cancer subtypes. Similarly, a positive correlation of EMT score and MnSOD expression was observed in established cell lines derived from breast cancers exhibiting phenotypes ranging from the most epithelial to the most mesenchymal. Interestingly, using phenotypically distinct breast cancer cell lines, we provide evidence that constitutively high or induced expression of MnSOD promotes the EMT-like phenotype by way of a redox milieu predominantly driven by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Conversely, gene knockdown of MnSOD results in the reversal of EMT to a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)-like program, which appears to be a function of superoxide (O2(-\u2022))-directed signaling.\nContext 3: To determine whether amifostine can induce elevated manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in murine tissues and a transplantable SA-NH tumor, resulting in a delayed tumor cell radioprotective effect.\nContext 4: Defects of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) have long been implicated in generation of oxidative stress and risk susceptibility to various cancers. Two functional polymorphisms within the MnSOD gene, including the Val-9Ala of the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and the Ile58Thr of the exon-3, have been proposed to reduce its enzyme activity and antioxidant potential.\nContext 5: In 2014, breast cancer remains a major cause of mortality worldwide mostly due to tumor relapse and metastasis. There is currently a great interest in identifying cancer biomarkers and signalling pathways mechanistically related to breast cancer progression. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a member of matrix degrading enzymes involved in cancer development and progression. In this study, we investigated the role of MMP-9 in breast cancer progression and metastasis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the development of breast cancer. We found that MnSOD expression was significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. The expression of MnSOD was significantly decreased in breast cancer cell lines and xenografts. The expression of MnSOD was significantly increased in breast cancer cell lines and xenografts after treatment with the MnSOD inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP). The expression of MnSOD was significantly increased in breast cancer cell lines", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We previously showed that inhibitor of growth family member 4 (ING4) inhibits melanoma angiogenesis, and JWA suppresses the metastasis of melanoma cells. As angiogenesis is essential for tumour metastasis, further investigation of the function of ING4 and JWA in melanoma angiogenesis is needed, and their prognostic value are of great interest.\nContext 2: ING4 promoted JWA expression by activating JWA promoter. Furthermore, the regulation of growth and tube formation of endothelial cells by ING4 was partially JWA dependent. Also, ING4 inhibited the ILK-induced angiogenesis signalling pathway via JWA. Moreover, reduced JWA, or increased ILK, expression was closely associated with 5-year disease-specific survival of melanoma patients (P=0.001 and 0.007, respectively). There was also a positive correlation between ING4 and JWA yet a negative correlation between ING4 and ILK. Importantly, their concomitant expressions were significantly related to 5-year survival of melanoma patients (P=0.002 and 0.003, respectively).\nContext 3: Western blot, tube-formation assays and luciferase assays were used to investigate the correlation between ING4 and JWA in melanoma angiogenesis. JWA and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression was determined on a tissue microarray constructed from 175 biopsies.\nContext 4: Recent understanding on cancer therapy indicated that targeting metastatic signature or angiogenic switch could be a promising and rational approach to combat cancer. Advancement in cancer research has demonstrated the potential role of various tumor suppressor proteins in inhibition of cancer progression. Current studies have shown that axonal sprouting inhibitor, semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) acts as a potent suppressor of tumor angiogenesis in various cancer models. However, the function of Sema 3A in regulation of melanoma progression is not well studied, and yet to be the subject of intense investigation.\nContext 5: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis.

Accumulation of normeperidine, a meperidine metabolite with neuroexcitatory effects, has led to recommendations to limit the use of meperidine postoperatively. The purpose of this study was to determine if the addition of adrenaline to PCEA meperidine decreased meperidine consumption, reduced serum normeperidine levels, and improved analgesia following thoracotomy.\nContext 2: Pre-emptive analgesia may relieve post-operative pain. However, its effects on immune function of patients undergoing thoracotomy are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated effects of pre-emptive epidural analgesia on post-operative pain and immune function in patients undergoing thoracotomy.\nContext 3: Meperidine has local anesthetic properties and, therefore, when given epidurally it has the potential to cause hemodynamic changes. Our objective was to study the hemodynamic effects of an analgesic dose of epidural meperidine (50 mg) in 34 ASA 1-2 term parturients scheduled for elective Cesarean section under epidural anesthesia.\nContext 4: Through a blinded prospective study, we investigated postoperative critically-ill surgical and trauma patients with primary intra-abdominal hypertension, who received postoperative thoracic epidural analgesia (n = 58) or intravenous opioid analgesia (n = 130). Patients in the epidural group received ropivacaine 0.2% 10 ml, followed by an infusion of 5 ml/h for 96 hours. Patients in the opioid group could receive morphine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg IV for every 4-6 hours as needed) with or without ketorolac trometamol (up to 90 mg/day IV). IAP was measured transvesically, for every 6 hours. Additionally, measurements immediately before and 1 hour after the initiation of epidural analgesia were taken. Abdominal Perfusion Pressure (APP) was calculated for each IAP measurement as APP = MAP - IAP where MAP is the mean arterial pressure.\nContext 5: Epidural meperidine produced a small increase from the saline values in the mean (SD) cardiac output of 5.81 +/-1.44 to 6.04+/-1.54 L x min(-1) x m(-2) (p = 0.03). The mean (SD) cardiac index increased from 2.33 +/-0.54 to 2.55 +/-0.59 L x min(-1) x m(-2) (p = 0.02). The mean (SD) systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1.96 +/-0.43 to 1.82 +/-0.38 mmHg x min(-1) x m(-2) (p = 0.02).

(2012) showed that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves hemodynamic parameters but does not significantly change the LV rotation or rotation rate. LV torsion, defined as LV rotation of each slice with respect to that of the most basal slice, was not significantly changed by CRT. CRT did not significantly change the LV torsion rate. There was no significant circumferential regional heterogeneity (anterior, lateral, inferior, and septal) in LV rotation mechanics in either left bundle branch block with pacing-induced heart failure or CRT, but there was significant", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Eps15 homology (EH) domains are protein interaction modules binding to peptides containing Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs and mediating critical events during endocytosis and signal transduction. The EH domain of POB1 associates with Eps15, a protein characterized by a striking string of DPF triplets, 15 in human and 13 in mouse Eps15, at the C-terminus and lacking the typical EH-binding NPF motif.\nContext 2: By screening a multivalent nonapeptide phage display library we have demonstrated that the EH domain of POB1 has a different recognition specificity since it binds to both NPF and DPF motifs. The region of mouse Eps15 responsible for the interaction with the EH domain of POB1 maps within a 18 amino acid peptide (residues 623-640) that includes three DPF repeats. Finally, mutational analysis in the EH domain of POB1, revealed that several solvent exposed residues, while distal to the binding pocket, mediate specific recognition of binding partners through both hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts.\nContext 3: We found that ADAMTS13 interacted with the rVWF A1, A2, A3 domains and full-length VWF, while TSP1 also bound to three A domains, especially to A2 and A3 domains. We observed that TSP1 partially blocked ADAMTS13 binding to A2 domain, A3 domain and full length VWF. The results of our assays showed that TSP1 could restrain ADAMTS13 activity up to 70%.\nContext 4: Utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we have determined the three-dimensional fold of the CBFA Runt domain in its DNA-bound state, showing that it is an s-type immunoglobulin (Ig) fold. DNA binding by the Runt domain is shown to be mediated by loop regions located at both ends of the Runt domain Ig fold. A putative site for CBFB binding has been identified; the spatial location of this site provides a rationale for the ability of CBFB to modulate the affinity of the Runt domain for DNA.\nContext 5: Through domain mapping and immunoprecipitation experiments, we determined that both the amino and carboxyl termini of PRMT6, and the activation domain within Tat are essential for interaction. Mutation of the basic domain of Tat did not affect the ability of PRMT6 to interact with Tat, but did reduce the ability of PRMT6 to interact with the amino terminus of Tat. The amino terminus of Tat was found to be necessary for interaction with PRMT6, but not with the carboxyl terminus of Tat. The amino terminus of Tat was also found to be necessary for interaction with the activation domain of PRMT6. The amino terminus of Tat was found to be necessary for interaction with PRMT6, but not with the carboxyl terminus of Tat.

Acute regulated release of active t-PA occurs within minutes in response to threatening thrombotic vessel occlusion. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of surgical stimulation on the kinetics of t-PA release in the coronary vascular bed in the pig.\nContext 2: Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the key factor in initiating endogenous fibrinolysis in the vascular compartment. Regulated release of t-PA from endothelial stores is rapidly induced by several humoral factors as well as coagulation activation products. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that regional myocardial ischemia induces regulated release of t-PA in the coronary vasculature in vivo.\nContext 3: The fibrinolytic system is intimately involved in several processes that contribute to restenosis, including clot dissolution, cell migration, and tissue remodeling. However, the role of the individual activators (urokinase [uPA] and tissue plasminogen [tPA] activators) and inhibitors (plasminogen activator inhibitor [PAI-1]) of the fibrinolytic system in maintaining patency after coronary artery angioplasty and stenting is unclear.\nContext 4: Thirty pigs were used and their coronary arteries were injured for the dilatation of balloons. Morphological measurements include neointimal area, injury score and the extent of area stenosis. Whole-blood tissue factor levels were measured before and after intervention. The circulating tissue factor levels increased significantly after intervention (baseline value, 328.54 \u00b1 47.46 pg/ml; at 30th minute, 618.96 \u00b1 119.08 pg/ml; at 24th hour, 639.34 \u00b1 116.21 pg/ml) (p < 0.01), and the degrees of tissue factor changes correlated positively to the neointimal hyperplasty (r(30th min) = 0.751, r(24th hour) = 0.72, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference with the baseline whole blood tissue factor (TF) levels between restenotic and non-restenotic cases (330.83 \u00b1 47.32 vs. 325.1 \u00b1 49.57 pg/ml, p = 0.7).\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single intravenous bolus of urokinase on the fibrinolytic system in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single intravenous bolus of urokinase on the fibrinolytic system in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single intravenous bolus of urokinase on the fibrinolytic system in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nContext 8: The aim", "#1: No, because the relationship between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk is independent of the subsequent development of diabetes during follow-up.\n#2: No, because the relationship between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk is independent of the subsequent development of diabetes during follow-up.\n#3: No, because the relationship between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk is independent of the subsequent development of diabetes during follow-up.\n#4: No, because the relationship between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk is independent of the subsequent development of diabetes during follow-up.\n#5: No, because the relationship between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular risk is independent of the subsequent development of diabetes during follow-up.\n#6: No, because the relationship between impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal ischemia (CGI) remains a clinical challenge.

After an overnight fast, subjects consumed a standard semi-solid meal, to which 0.5 mCi Tc99-labeled sulfur colloid had been added. The meal was consumed within 10 min. Scintigraphic imaging was performed with a gamma camera immediately after the completion of the meal as well as after 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed by drawing a region of interest (ROI) enclosing the stomach on the anterior and the posterior images. Time 0 was considered the time of meal completion (all the ingested activity) and was defined as 100% retention. The same ROI was used on all consecutive images of the same projection for the same patient. The geometric mean of the anterior and the posterior counts for each time point is calculated and corrected for Tc(99m) decay. Gastric emptying curves were constructed. T 1/2 is the time interval between completion of the meal and the point at which half of the meal (by radioactivity counts) has left the stomach. Retention is expressed as the percent remaining in the stomach at each time point (half, 1, 2, 3, 4 h).\nContext 4: After radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus, it may be difficult to determine whether complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia at the neosquamocolumnar junction (neo-SCJ) in the cardia has been achieved. It is claimed that narrow band imaging (NBI) may predict the presence of intestinal metaplasia, which would enable immediate treatment.

Antibodies against linear epitopes were identified by immunoblot using recombinant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (aa1-125) and human myelin basic protein preparations.\nContext 3: The proposed predictive value of serum anti-myelin antibodies for the development of multiple sclerosis after a first clinically isolated syndrome was recently challenged.\nContext 4: To study the longitudinal dynamics of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoantibodies in childhood demyelinating diseases.\nContext 5: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of antibodies to MOG and to myelin basic protein were significantly higher in patients with MS (P<.001 and P =.001, respectively) and patients with ONDs (P =.005 and P =.03, respectively) compared with controls; frequency of antibodies to MOG, but not to myelin basic protein, was higher in patients with MS and patients with ONDs (P =.01 and P =.003, respectively, for the frequency of anti-MOG antibody, and P =.65 and P =.41, respectively, for the frequency of anti-myelin basic protein antibody). Plasma levels of antibodies to MOG and to myelin basic protein were higher in patients with MS compared with patients with ONDs (P =.003 for both comparisons) and with controls (P =.03 and P =.04, respectively); however, the frequency of antibodies to MOG and myelin basic protein was similar in patients with MS, patients with ONDs (P=.54 and P =.82, respectively), and controls (P =.50 and P =.14, respectively).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nThe presence of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) was evaluated.

Recently, it has been suggested that NADPH oxidase (NOX) isozymes serve functional roles in toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immune responses. However, the molecular mechanism between TLR and NOX-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human airway mucosa has been poorly understood.\nContext 2: Our observation in this study reveals that flagellin-induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) generation is critical for TLR5-dependent innate immune responses, including IL-8 production and MUC5AC expression in the nasal epithelium. Furthermore, DUOX2-mediated H(2)O(2) generation activated by the flagellin-TLR5 axis might serve as a novel therapeutic target for infectious inflammation diseases in the airway tract.\nContext 3: Airway inflammation and asthma have been linked to oxidative stress and the melastatin-related transient receptor potential cation channel, member 2 (TRPM2), which can be activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.\nContext 4: HDM-derived \u03b2-glucans, rather than LPS, were proven to be essential to activating innate immunity in the nasal mucosa and triggering AR, which depended on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but not on TLR4; however, the LPS/TLR4 signaling axis, rather than \u03b2-glucans/TLR2, was critical to HDM-induced AA. These differences were attributed to the specific role of \u03b2-glucans and LPS in inducing the surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4 and their translocation to lipid rafts in nasal and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. We also showed that dual oxidase 2-generated reactive oxygen species mediate both \u03b2-glucan-induced TLR2 activation and LPS-induced TLR4 activation.\nContext 5: The bronchial asthma, a clinical complication of persistent inflammation of the airway and subsequent airway hyper-responsiveness, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Several studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in initiation as well as amplification of inflammation in airways. However, still there are no good anti-oxidant strategies available for therapeutic intervention in asthma pathogenesis. Most of the current anti-oxidant strategies are based on the use of antioxidants, which are not effective in the treatment of asthma. In this study, we have shown that the dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) is a novel therapeutic target for asthma. DUOX2 is a key enzyme in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. We have shown that DUOX2 is a critical enzyme in the production of ROS and is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. We have also shown that DUOX2 is a critical enzyme in the production of ROS and is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. We have also shown that DUOX2 is a critical enzyme in the production of ROS", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) develops from a segmentally reiterated array of 30 neural precursors. Each precursor acquires a unique identity and goes through a stereotyped cell lineage to produce an invariant family of neurons and/or glia. The proneural genes achaete, scute and lethal of scute are required for neural precursor formation in the Drosophila CNS, and are expressed in overlapping subsets of 'proneural cell clusters' from which a single neural precursor later develops. Vertebrate achaete-scute homologues are expressed early during neurogenesis, and promote neurogenesis, neuronal development and/or differentiation. The Drosophila proneural achaete-scute genes govern neural precursor formation, but their role in specifying neural precursor identity has not been tested.\nContext 2: Here, we test the role of the Drosophila achaete-scute genes in specifying neural precursor identity, focusing on the well characterized CNS MP2 precursor. MP2 delaminates from a cluster of achaete-scute-expressing ectodermal cells. In an achaete-scute double mutant, MP2 formation was reduced (to 11-14 %) as expected because of the function of proneural genes in promoting neural precursor formation. Surprisingly, we also observed that the developing MP2 precursors were incorrectly specified and acquired traits characteristic of adjacent neural precursors. In rescue experiments, achaete or scute, but not lethal of scute, completely restored the normal MP2 identity.\nContext 3: We find that there are highly restricted domains of retinoic acid synthesis and breakdown within specific hindbrain nuclei as well as the ventricular layer and roofplate. Intriguingly, transcripts of cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 are always found at the interface between dividing and post-mitotic cells. By contrast to earlier stages of development, domains of synthesis and breakdown in post-mitotic neurons are co-localised. At the rhombic lip, expression of the mRNA for retinoic acid synthesising and catabolising enzymes is spatially highly organised with respect to the Cath1-positive precursors of migratory precerebellar neurons.\nContext 4: In contrast to the complexity found in mammals, only two Bcl-2 family genes have been found in Drosophila melanogaster including the pro-cell survival, human Bok-related orthologue, Buffy. The directed evolution of Buffy has been used to generate a series of mutants with altered Bcl-2 family member expression. Buffy is expressed in the CNS and in the ventral midline of the embryo. Buffy is expressed in the ventral midline of the embryo. Buffy is expressed in the ventral midline of the embryo. Buffy is expressed in the ventral midline of the embryo.

Autoantibody-containing serum or purified IgG from dry-eye mice was sufficient to mediate complement-dependent ocular surface inflammation. Serum or purified IgG caused marked inflammatory burden and tissue damage within the ocular surface tissues, including elevated Gr1+ neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines associated with goblet cell loss. Moreover, complement C3b deposition was found within the ocular surface tissues of mice receiving dry-eye serum, but not in recipients of control serum. Functionally, complement depletion attenuated the ability to transfer dry-eye-specific serum or IgG-mediated disease.\nContext 3: Dry eye was induced by exposing female C57BL/6 wild-type mice or hen egg lysozyme B-cell receptor transgenic mice to desiccating stress (subcutaneous scopolamine [0.5 mg/0.2 mL] 3 times a day, humidity < 40%, and sustained airflow) for 3 weeks, allowing sufficient time for a humoral immune response. Serum or purified IgG isolated from dry-eye mice or untreated controls was passively transferred to nude recipient mice, which were evaluated for ocular surface inflammation 3 days after transfer. To determine if complement activation contributed to serum-induced dry eye disease, cobra venom factor was used to deplete complement activity.\nContext 4: DS was induced by subcutaneous injection of scopolamine and exposure to a drafty low humidity environment in CD4-DNTGF\u03b2RII and wild-type (WT) mice, aged 14 weeks, for 5 days. Nonstressed (NS) mice served as controls. Parameters of ocular surface disease included corneal smoothness, corneal barrier function and conjunctival goblet cell density. NS CD4-DNTGF\u03b2RII at 14 weeks of age mice exhibited a spontaneous dry eye phenotype; however, DS improved their corneal barrier function and corneal surface irregularity, increased their number of PAS+ GC, and lowered CD4(+) T cell infiltration in conjunctiva. In contrast to WT, CD4-DNTGF\u03b2RII mice did not generate a Th-17 and Th-1 response, and did not exhibit a Th-2 response. In addition, CD4-DNTGF\u03b2RII mice did not exhibit a Th-17 response, and did not exhibit a Th-2 response. In addition, CD4-DNTGF\u03b2RII mice did not exhibit a Th-17 response, and did not exhibit a Th-2 response.

The procedure is a non-invasive method of reducing fat in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. The procedure is performed by placing the patient in a cold chamber and applying a vacuum to the skin. The vacuum draws the fat cells to the surface of the skin, where they are then frozen and destroyed. The procedure is performed", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Sternal reconstruction with vascularized flaps is central to the management of sternal wound infections and mediastinitis but carries a high risk of complications. There is a need to identify reliable predictors of complication risk to help inform patients and clinicians in preparation for surgery. Unfortunately, body mass index and serum albumin may not be reliable predictors of complication rates. Analytic morphomics provides a robust quantitative method to measure patients' obesity as it pertains to their risk of complications in undergoing sternal reconstruction.\nContext 2: We identified 34 patients with preoperative computed tomography scans of the abdomen from a cohort of sternal reconstructions performed between 1997 and 2010. Using semiautomated analytic morphomics, we identified the patients' skin and fascia layers between the ninth and 12th thoracic spine levels; from these landmarks, we calculated morphomic measurements of the patients' abdomens, including their total body cross sectional area and the cross sectional area of their subcutaneous fat. We obtained the incidence of complications from chart review and correlated the incidence of complications (including seroma, hematoma, recurrent wounds, mediastinitis, tracheostomy, and death) with patients' morphomic measurements.\nContext 3: The authors performed a retrospective review of the medical records of 18 patients (20 breasts) who had undergone breast reconstruction at Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital from March of 2009 to July of 2012. All of the patients underwent preoperative assessment of breast volume with two methods: a plaster cast maneuver and a three-dimensional simulated magnetic resonance imaging scan. To determine the accuracy of each method, the authors compared the mastectomy volume with the plaster cast maneuver and with three-dimensional simulated magnetic resonance imaging.\nContext 4: We retrospectively studied all consecutive patients who underwent CS for abdominal wall reconstruction during 8 years and compared outcomes of patients with and without rectus violation. Primary outcomes measures included complications and hernia recurrence. Logistic regression analysis identified potential associations between patient, defect, and reconstructive characteristics and surgical outcomes.\nContext 5: Twenty-three patients (7.8%) had a major complication after their breast reduction. Ten of these complications occurred in the left breast, 9 in the right breast, and 4 in both breasts. Statistical analysis revealed no differences in major complication rates between the side operated on with the primary surgeon being the resident versus the attending (4.7% versus 4.4%; p = 1.0) or the attending versus the attending with the resident (4.7% versus 4.4%; p = 1.0). The complication rate was 4.4% in the left breast, 4.4% in the right breast, and 4.4% in both breasts. The complication rate was 4.4% in the left breast, 4.4% in the right breast, and 4.4% in both breasts.

The fifth toenail is the most common site of onychodystrophy. On", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Chloroplast division in plant cells occurs by binary fission, yielding two daughter plastids of equal size. Previously, we reported that two Arabidopsis homologues of FtsZ, a bacterial protein that forms a cytokinetic ring during cell division, are essential for plastid division in plants, and may be involved in the formation of plastid-dividing rings on both the stromal and cytosolic surfaces of the chloroplast envelope membranes. In bacteria, positioning of the FtsZ ring at the center of the cell is mediated in part by the protein MinD. Here, we identified AtMinD1, an Arabidopsis homologue of MinD, and investigated whether positioning of the plastid-division apparatus at the plastid midpoint might involve a mechanism similar to that in bacteria.\nContext 2: Sequence analysis and in vitro chloroplast import experiments indicated that AtMinD1 contains a transit peptide that targets it to the chloroplast. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with reduced AtMinD1 expression exhibited variability in chloroplast size and number and asymmetrically constricted chloroplasts, strongly suggesting that the plastid-division machinery is misplaced. Overexpression of AtMinD1 inhibited chloroplast division. These phenotypes resemble those of bacterial mutants with altered minD expression.\nContext 3: In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by constriction of an actomyosin ring. In fission yeast, ring constriction is followed by deposition of a multilayered division septum that must be cleaved to release the two daughter cells. Although many studies have focused on the actomyosin ring and septum assembly, little is known about the later steps involving the cleavage of the cell wall.\nContext 4: Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division taking place at the end of mitosis during which the cytoplasmic content and replicated chromosomes of a cell are equally partitioned between the two daughter cells. This process is achieved by the formation and the ingression of an actomyosin contractile ring under the control of equatorial microtubules. The mechanisms of contractile ring formation are not fully understood but involve recruitment of preexisting actin filaments and de novo actin polymerisation.\nContext 5: Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are among the original model organisms in the study of the cell-division cycle. Unlike budding yeast, no large-scale genetic screens have been performed in fission yeast. In this study, we have used a genetic approach to identify genes involved in the cell-division cycle in fission yeast. We have identified a novel gene, fission yeast homologue of minD, which is required for cytokinesis. The fission yeast minD homologue is a homologue of the bacterial minD protein, which is required for cytokinesis in bacteria. The fission yeast minD homologue is required for cytokinesis in fission yeast. The fission yeast minD homologue is required for cytokinesis in fission yeast.

Appropriate positioning of TKA components therefore is a key concern of surgeons. However, obtaining neutral alignment can be challenging in patients with substantial preoperative varus deformity and it is unclear whether residual deformity influences revision rates.\nContext 2: We asked: (1) in patients with preoperative varus deformities, does residual postoperative varus limb alignment lead to increased revision rates or lower IKS scores compared with correction to neutral alignment, (2) does placing the tibial component in varus alignment lead to increased revision rates and lower IKS scores, (3) does femoral component alignment affect revision rates and IKS scores, and (4) do these findings change in patients with at least 10\u00b0 varus alignment preoperatively?\nContext 3: From a prospective database, we identified 553 patients undergoing TKAs for varus osteoarthritis. Patients were divided into those with residual postoperative varus and those with neutral postoperative alignment. Revision rates and International Knee Society (IKS) scores were compared between the two groups and assessed based on postoperative component alignment. Survival analysis was conducted with revision as the endpoint. The analysis was repeated in a subgroup of patients with at least 10\u00b0 preoperative varus. Minimum followup was 2 years (median, 4.7 years; range, 2-19.8 years).\nContext 4: We retrospectively reviewed 70 patients with osteoarthritis and varus deformities who underwent 90 TKAs. We retrospectively divided the 90 knees into three groups according to degree of preoperative alignment: mild varus group (<10\u00b0), moderate varus group (10\u00b0-20\u00b0), and severe varus group (>20\u00b0). To evaluate intraoperative soft tissue tension, we calculated the soft tissue gap by subtracting the thickness of the resected bone from the joint gaps on the medial and lateral sides, respectively. We then explored the relationship between the soft tissue gap and preoperative alignment.\nContext 5: The two groups had similar survival rates to 10 years and similar IKS scores.

The frequencies and distributions of single nucleotide polymorphisms, haplotypes, and diplotypes of NAT2 were determined by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: According to previous studies neuromuscular blockade may affect the depth of anesthesia. One theory states that neuromuscular blockade prevents disturbing EMG signals, arousing from the muscles of the forehead, from falsely elevating bispectral index (BIS)-levels. According to the afferentation theory signals generated in muscle stretch receptors, accessing the brain through afferent nerve pathways, induce arousal. By blocking these signals neuromuscular blockade would increase depth of anesthesia. Arousal has previously been associated with neostigmine reversal. This study investigates the possible effect of sugammadex on the level of anesthesia as defined by BIS and spectral entropy levels.\nContext 2: In this retrospective case-control study, we analyzed data from 45 patients divided into 3 groups: dexamethasone after induction group (15 patients) treated with 8 mg dexamethasone as an antiemetic drug shortly after induction of anesthesia; dexamethasone before reversal group (15 patients) treated with dexamethasone just before sugammadex injection; and control group (15 patients) treated with 8 mg ondansetron. All groups received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium at induction, 0.15 mg/kg rocuronium at train-of-four ratio (TOF) 2 for neuromuscular relaxation, and 2 mg/kg sugammadex for reversal at the end of the procedure at TOF2. Neuromuscular relaxation was monitored with a TOF-Watch\u00ae system.\nContext 3: Thirty elective patients were enrolled. All patients received propofol and remifentanil by target controlled infusion and an intermediate level neuromuscular blockade induced and maintained by bolus doses of rocuronium. Depth of anesthesia was monitored by BIS and spectral entropy. The patients were given 2\u00a0mg/kg sugammadex 5\u00a0min after finishing of surgery. Propofol and remifentanil infusions were kept unchanged for another 10\u00a0min while BIS and entropy values were recorded.\nContext 4: Sugammadex is a relatively new molecule that reverses neuromuscular block induced by rocuronium. The particular structure of sugammadex traps the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene ring of rocuronium in its hydrophobic cavity. Dexamethasone shares the same steroidal structure with rocuronium. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that dexamethasone is a competitive antagonist of rocuronium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the level of anesthesia as defined by BIS and spectral entropy levels.\nContext 5: The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee.

Mitochondrial DNA that shows similarities to bacterial DNA may be released after tissue damage and activates the innate immune system by binding to toll-like receptor-9 on immune cells. The aim of this study was to analyze whether levels of mitochondrial DNA are associated with 30-day survival and whether this predictive value is modified by the expression of its receptor toll-like receptor-9.\nContext 2: Blood was taken within 24 hours after ICU admission, and the levels of circulating mitochondrial DNA were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Toll-like receptor-9 expression in monocytes was measured by flow cytometry. Median acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 20, and 30-day mortality was 25%. Median mitochondrial DNA levels at admission were significantly higher in nonsurvivors when compared with survivors (26.9, interquartile range = 11.2-60.6 ng/mL vs 19.7, interquartile range = 9.5-34.8 ng/mL; p < 0.05). Patients with plasma levels of mitochondrial DNA in the highest quartile (mitochondrial DNA > 38.2 ng/mL) had a 2.6-fold higher risk (p < 0.001) of dying, independently of age, gender, diagnosis, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score. Mitochondrial DNA improved the c-statistic of acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (p < 0.05) and showed enhancement in individual risk prediction indicated by a net reclassification improvement of 32.3% (p < 0.05). Stratification of patients according to toll-like receptor-9 expression above/below median demonstrated that only patients with high expression of toll-like receptor-9 showed an increased risk associated with increased mitochondrial DNA levels (odds ratio, 2.7; p < 0.01), whereas circulating mitochondrial DNA was not associated with mortality in patients with low toll-like receptor-9 expression (odds ratio, 1.1; p = 0.98).\nContext 3: The role of mitochondrial dysfunction has not been thoroughly clarified in the pathogenesis of critically ill patients. The objective of this study was to investigate mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and apoptosis in circulating platelets in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis.\nContext 4: Platelets were isolated from blood samples of 30 patients with SIRS and sepsis and 30 healthy controls. Platelet membrane potential was measured by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V staining. Platelet apoptosis was significantly higher in patients with SIRS and sepsis than in healthy controls (p < 0.05). Platelet membrane potential was significantly lower in patients with SIRS and sepsis than in healthy controls (p < 0.05). Platelet membrane potential was significantly lower in patients with SIRS and sepsis than in patients with SIRS alone (p < 0.05). Platelet apoptosis was significantly higher in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Authors of several studies have studied biomarkers and computed tomography (CT) findings in the acute phase after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the correlation between structural damage as assessed by neuroimaging and biomarkers has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among neuronal (Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 [UCH-L1]) and glial (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) biomarker levels in serum, neuroradiological findings and outcomes after severe TBI.\nContext 2: As far as paediatric traumatic brain injury is concerned, it is difficult to quantify the extent of the primary insult, to monitor secondary changes and to predict neurological outcomes by means of the currently used diagnostic tools: physical examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and computed tomography. For this reason, several papers focused on the use of biochemical markers (S100B, neuron-specific enolase) to detect and define the severity of brain damage and predict outcome after traumatic head injury or cardiac arrest.\nContext 3: 62 victims (male to female ratio 4 : 1; age range 15-68 years) of traumatic brain injury were studied. Group 1 (n = 24) consisted of patients who suffered from traumatic brain injury with additional multiple organ injury, group 2 (n = 38) comprised patients with isolated brain injury. Outcome was assessed at 6 and 12 months after trauma by means of different rehabilitation scores.\nContext 4: Thirty-four patients in post-traumatic VS were assessed clinically and neurophysiologically at 2-3 months after injury and followed up to 1 year. Patients were assessed with the Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and with electroencephalogram (EEG), brainstem auditory (BAEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and P300. Demographic, clinical and neurophysiological measures were analysed by descriptive and logistic regression techniques.\nContext 5: Eighteen adult patients with severe contusional traumatic brain injury, on computerized tomography, were identified. Patients with diffuse injuries or extradural and subdural hematomas associated with mass effect were not included in the study.

We evaluated the relevance of this concept for cisplatin by analyzing cisplatin pharmacokinetics obtained in prospective studies in a large patient population.\nContext 2: Data were obtained from 268 adult patients (163 males/105 females; median age, 54 years [range, 21 to 74 years]) with advanced solid tumors treated in phase I/II trials with cisplatin monotherapy or combination chemotherapy with etoposide, irinotecan, topotecan, or docetaxel. Cisplatin was administered either weekly (n = 93) or once every 3 weeks (n = 175) at dose levels of 50 to 100 mg/m(2) (3-hour infusion). Analysis of 485 complete courses was based on measurement of total and non-protein-bound cisplatin in plasma by atomic absorption spectrometry.\nContext 3: Baseline measured CrCl was less than 60 mL/min in 16% compared with 12% to 44% using various formulas. Concordance between calculated and measured CrCl less than 60 mL/min was poor (range of kappa, 0.14 to 0.38). In patients older than age 65, 22% had a measured CrCl less than 60 mL/min, compared with 10% to 63% calculated using various formulas. Overall, 80% completed at least three cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The ability to complete at least three cycles was statistically significantly related with a measured CrCl more than 60 mL/min (P =.02), but not with calculated CrCl more than 60 mL/min.\nContext 4: No pharmacokinetic interaction was found between cisplatin and the anticancer drugs used in combination therapies. A linear correlation was observed between area under the curves of unbound and total cisplatin (r = 0.63). The mean plasma clearance of unbound cisplatin (CL(free)) was 57.1 +/- 14.7 L/h (range, 31.0 to 116 L/h), with an interpatient variability of 25.6%. BSA varied between 1.43 and 2.40 m(2) (mean, 1.86 +/- 0.19 m(2)), with an interpatient variability of 0.19 m(2).

All patients underwent carotid ultrasound for evaluation of carotid artery plaque score defined by the sum of plaque thickness, maximum percent area stenosis, and carotid arterial stiffness index beta calculated by a combination of changes in carotid arterial diameter and blood pressure. It is still controversial whether carotid plaque is associated with cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of carotid plaque on long term clinical outcomes especially in patients with CAD. Ischemic stroke is more often diagnosed", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is frequently described in terms of input- throughput and output. In order to reduce ED input, a concept called primary triage has been introduced in several Swedish EDs. In short, primary triage means that a nurse separately evaluates patients who present in the Emergency Department (ED) and either refers them to primary care or discharges them home, if their complaints are perceived as being of low acuity. The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether high levels of in-hospital bed occupancy are associated with decreased permeability in primary triage. The appropriateness of discharges from primary triage is assessed by 72-h revisits to the ED.\nContext 2: A total of 37,129 visits to primary triage were included in the study. 53.4 % of these were admitted to the ED. Among the cases referred to another level of care, 8.8\u00a0% made an unplanned revisit to the ED within 72\u00a0h. The permeability of primary triage was not decreased at higher levels of in-hospital bed occupancy. Rather, the permeability was slightly higher at occupancy of 100-105\u00a0% compared to <95\u00a0% (OR 1.09 95\u00a0% CI 1.02-1.16). No significant association between in-hospital bed occupancy and the probability of 72-h revisits was observed.\nContext 3: Studies suggest that collaborative nursing protocols initiated in triage improve emergency department (ED) throughput and decrease time to treatment.\nContext 4: The Affordable Care Act places primary care at the cornerstone of health maintenance. It is believed that increasing access to primary health care providers will limit emergency department (ED) use. This study examines woman's health-related ED visits by patients enrolled in an obstetric/gynecologic (OB/GYN) clinic.\nContext 5: This is a retrospective review of patients evaluated by emergency medicine (EM) residents working 9-hour (eight hours of patient care, one hour wrap-up time) and 12-hour shifts (12 hours patient care, no reserved time for wrap-up). Data were collected by reviewing the clinical tracker. A patient was assigned to the resident who initiated care and dictated the chart.

We aimed to provide a booster strategy among adolescents as a result of their changes in lifestyle and sexual activity.\nContext 2: This study comprised a series of cross-sectional serological surveys of HBV markers in four age groups between 2004 and 2012. The seropositivity rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its reciprocal antibody (anti-HBs) for each age group were collected. There were two parts to this study; age-specific HBV seroepidemiology and subgroup analysis, including effects of different vaccine types, booster response for immunogenicity at 15\u00a0years of age, and longitudinal follow-up to identify possible additional protection by HBV booster.\nContext 3: Totally 546 children (1-7-year-old) of 544 HBV-infected mothers were investigated, with 397 breastfed and 149 formula-fed; 137 were born to HBeAg-positive mothers. All children had been vaccinated against hepatitis B but only 53.3% received hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). The overall prevalence of HBsAg+, HBsAg-/anti-HBc+, and anti-HBs (\u226510 mIU/ml) in children was 2.4%, 3.1%, and 71.6% respectively. The HBsAg prevalence in breast- and formula-fed children was 1.5% and 4.7% respectively (P\u200a=\u200a0.063); the difference was likely due to the higher mothers' HBeAg-positive rate in formula-fed group (formula-fed 49.0% vs. breastfed 15.9%, P<0.001). Further logistic regression analyses showed that breastfeeding was not associated with the HBV infection in the children, adjusting for the effect of maternal HBeAg status and other factors different between the two groups.\nContext 4: In all, 65% had heard of meningococcal vaccine; parents more likely to report awareness had adolescents aged 16 to 17 years, in private school, or with health insurance. In total, 44% of aware parents reported vaccination; vaccinated teens were more likely to be black (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17), had a preventive checkup (OR = 2.17), and had a parent who had been vaccinated (OR = 2.17). The vaccine coverage was 44% for adolescents aged 16 to 17 years, 38% for those aged 12 to 15 years, and 30% for those aged 11 to 12 years. The vaccine coverage was 44% for adolescents aged 16 to 17 years, 38% for those aged 12 to 15 years, and 30% for those aged 11 to 12 years.\nContext 5: The study was conducted in 2009 and 2010 in 10 districts of the province of Sichuan, China.

Previous studies using rodent models closely investigated the safety of daily repeated infusions (DRI) of HbV and reported that the reticuloendothelial system was physiologically capable of degrading HbV to maintain plasma clinical chemistry within normal ranges. The present study examined the effect of DRI of HbV on the pregnant rat mother and fetal development, focusing on placental transfer of HbV in pregnancy.\nContext 2: To test the hypothesis that liposome encapsulated hemoglobin (LEH), an experimental oxygen-carrying fluid, exacerbates endotoxin-induced lung injury in the rat.\nContext 3: We used an embryo-transfer approach, with fertilised GK/Par ovocytes (oGK) being transferred into pregnant Wistar (W) or GK/Par females (pW and pGK). Offspring were phenotyped at fetal age E18.5 and at 10\u00a0weeks of age, for BCM, expression of genes of pancreatic progenitor cell regulators (Igf2, Igf1r, Sox9, Pdx1 and Ngn3), glucose tolerance and insulin secretion.\nContext 4: Maternal DRI of HbV had no obvious side effects on the pregnant mother or on fetal development. Maternal vital signs, plasma clinical chemistry, and blood gas parameters were overall normal after DRI of HbV. In addition, maternal/fetal transfer of HbV was limited to the placenta and HbV did not reach the fetus. Histopathological examination with human hemoglobin antibody detected HbV accumulation in the maternal spleen, liver, kidney, and placenta, but not in the fetuses. These results were also confirmed by a pharmacokinetic study using (125)I-labeled HbV.\nContext 5: We investigated the ability of hemoglobin-based oxygen carrying solutions (HBOCs) to alleviate fetal hypoxemia from maternal hemorrhage. Fifteen pregnant ewes (132-day gestational age) were hemorrhaged 20 mL/kg over 1 h; they were randomized to receive 20 mL/kg IV of HBOC, hetastarch (HTS), or autologous blood (BLD) (n = 5 each) over 1 h. Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96\u00a0h after hemorrhage. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation (HbO2) and oxygen delivery (DO2) were measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96\u00a0h after hemorrhage. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation (HbO2) and oxygen delivery (DO2) were measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,", "Question: Is hormonal Contraception Use Common Among Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases and an Elevated Risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis??\nYes, hormonal contraception use is common among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and an elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis. The prevalence of hormonal contraception use was 30.4% among patients with IBD and 21.4% among patients without IBD. The prevalence of hormonal contraception use was higher among patients with IBD with an elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) compared to patients without IBD (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Treatment of Jurkat cells with 0.2 and 0.5% ethanol concentrations resulted in 25 and 50% decreases (p < or = 0.05) in TK activity, respectively. No significant changes were observed in the TMPK activities. However, ethanol decreased the formation of thymidine diphosphate from thymidine in coupled TK/TMPK reactions, suggesting that decreases in TK activity could result in an overall decrease in the phosphorylation of AZT. The effect of ethanol on TK was independent of its transcript level. AZT in combination with ethanol decreased the inhibitory effect of ethanol on TK activity. However, it did not block the ethanol effect even at higher concentrations. Ethanol significantly decreased the proliferative capacity and cell cycle progression of the Jurkat cells.\nContext 2: Thymidine kinase (TK) and thymidylate kinase (TMPK) are the two rate-limiting enzymes in the cascade of activation of the anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) to its active triphosphate form. We examined the effect of ethanol and a combination of ethanol and AZT on TK and TMPK activities in human Jurkat T cells.\nContext 3: Jurkat T cells were exposed to 0.2 and 0.5% (v/v) ethanol concentrations alone or in combination with 5 or 10 microM AZT for 48 hr in growth medium. TK and TMPK activities were determined by measuring the conversion of [3H] substrates (thymidine or AZT for TK and thymidine monophosphate for TMPK) to their respective monophosphate or diphosphate forms. The effect of ethanol on the transcriptional activity of TK was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and on the growth of Jurkat cells by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell-cycle analysis.\nContext 4: Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in mild steatosis and necrosis, whereas chronic ethanol followed by binge group exhibited marked steatosis and significant increase in necrosis. Chronic binge group also showed significant increase (compared with chronic ethanol alone) in the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), ERK2, and RSK. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK did not increase by the binge. Chronic ethanol treatment also resulted in significant increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and RSK. Chronic binge group also showed significant increase (compared with chronic ethanol alone) in the phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and RSK. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK did not increase by the binge. Chronic ethanol treatment also resulted in significant increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and RSK.

These were comparable for age, gender, dependency levels and cognition. After 6 months, the total number of medications per patient per day fell from 11.64 to 11.09 in the specialist group (P = 0.0364) and increased from 11.07 to 11.5 in the regular group (P = 0.094). There was no significant difference in mortality or frequency of acute hospital transfers (11 versus 6 in the specialist versus regular group, P = 0.213).\nContext 3: From 2003 to 2007, 1,250,619 isolated CABG operations were evaluated using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Patients were stratified by primary payer status: Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured, and private insurance. Hierarchical multiple regression models were applied to assess the effect of primary payer status on postoperative outcomes. Unadjusted mortality for Medicare (3.3%), Medicaid (2.4%), and uninsured (1.9%) patients were higher compared with private insurance patients (1.1%, P<0.001). Unadjusted length of stay was longest for Medicaid patients (10.9 \u00b1 0.04 days) and shortest for private insurance patients (8.0 \u00b1 0.01 days, P<0.001). Medicaid patients accrued the highest unadjusted total costs ($113 380 \u00b1 386, P<0.001). Importantly, after controlling for patient risk factors, income, hospital features, and operative volume, Medicaid (odds ratio, 1.82; P<0.001) and uninsured (odds ratio, 1.62; P<0.001) payer status independently conferred the highest adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality. In addition, Medicaid payer status was associated with the longest adjusted length of stay and highest adjusted total costs (P<0.001).\nContext 4: This study is based on a retrospective audit of provider-verified and patient-self-reported medication and supplement use by adults with diabetes at the University of Washington Diabetes Care Center during four 2-week periods from fall 2006 through summer 2007 (1 period per season).\nContext 5: Patients who received PGx testing saved $1035.60 in total medication costs and $1,000.00 in total health care costs.\nContext 6: The study was conducted in a large academic medical center.

Forty-eight eyes of 47 patients were enrolled in this study based on the presence of a peripheral zone of free denuded stroma between the margin of the graft and the host's Descemet membrane (DM) (group A) or a peripheral overlap between the graft and the host's DM (group B). In group A (n=26 eyes), the diameter of the descemetorhexis was approximately 10 mm, whereas in group B (n=22 eyes), the diameter was approximately 6 mm. Both groups received an 8-mm graft. Main outcome measures included peripheral corneal thickness (PCT) at 4 mm from the center, central corneal thickness (CCT), central-to-peripheral thickness ratio (CPTR), and endothelial cell density (ECD).\nContext 3: No statistically significant difference in incidence and degree of corneal neovascularization developing after penetrating keratoplasty was found between treatment groups and placebo group. Mean corneal neovascularization area at week 52 (visit 12) was 2.32\u00b11.79% in treatment group A versus placebo (2.79\u00b12.11%; P = 0.45) and 2.74\u00b12.22% in treatment group B versus placebo (2.79\u00b12.11%; P = 0.94).\nContext 4: Full-thickness allogeneic corneas induced vigorous DH and were rejected acutely. Similar results were obtained with allografts of corneal epithelium alone (if supported by syngeneic viable stroma), allografts of epithelium from cauterized corneas (containing Langerhans' cells), and stromal allografts deprived of endothelium. Grafts comprised of stroma plus endothelium (without epithelium) were not rejected, nor did they induce DH unless the graft had no CD95L expression. If stroma-endothelium grafts had no CD95L expression, DH directed against major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but not minor histocompatibility complex (MHC), was observed. The CD95L expression was not affected by the presence of Langerhans' cells.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that the presence of Langerhans' cells in the graft may be a factor in the rejection of allografts. The presence of CD95L in the graft may be a factor in the rejection of allografts. The presence of CD95L in the graft may be a factor in the rejection of allografts. The presence of CD95L in the graft may be a factor in the rejection of allografts.

However, whether the contribution of ED to adiposity remains significant when controlled for energy intake (EI) and physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) remains to be clearly established. We aimed to investigate", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens were obtained from 61 patients who underwent surgery following 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy at Kumamoto University Hospital between October 2003 and January 2009. Paraffin-embedded sections obtained from biopsy specimens were immunohistochemically analyzed. The associations between Dicer, Drosha, and various clinicopathological features were examined, and the effects of Dicer and Drosha on the prognosis were evaluated.\nContext 2: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, development of drug resistance is one of the major causes of HNSCC treatment failure. The goal of this study was to investigate the mechanism of 5-FU resistance and to develop a novel combination therapy with another agent which sensitizes cells to 5-FU.\nContext 3: A low Dicer tumor expression was significantly correlated with the pathological response to chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, a Cox regression analysis based on the overall survival revealed the Dicer expression status (hazard ratio, 0.34; P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) and pathological response to chemoradiotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.21; P\u00a0=\u00a00.014) to be significant prognostic factors in OSCC patients. On the other hand, the Drosha expression was not associated with any clinicopathological features or the prognosis.\nContext 4: The deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) is associated with multiple processes involved in cancer progression. RNase III endonucleases, Dicer and Drosha, are key enzymes for miRNA biogenesis, and it has been reported that altered expressions of these molecules affect the clinical outcomes of patients with various cancers. However, the clinical value of measuring the levels of Dicer and Drosha in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the expressions of Dicer and Drosha in patients with OSCC.\nContext 5: The standard treatment for non-metastatic oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is surgical resection followed by post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) with/without chemotherapy in high risk patients. Given the substantial toxicity of PORT we assessed lymph node ratio (LNR) as a predictor of PORT benefit.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n    - What is the role of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the clinical significance of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the role of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the clinical significance of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the role of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the clinical significance of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the role of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the clinical significance of Dicer and Drosha in OSCC?\n    - What is the role of Dicer and Drosha in OSC", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a combination of selenium-enriched green tea polysaccharides (Se-GTP) and Huo-ji polysaccharides (HJP) on the immune function and antioxidant activity in mice.\nContext 2: The antioxidant activity of the tea was studied in vitro by measuring the resistance of the LDL to oxidative modification in the presence of copper. The effects of tea consumption in vivo were investigated in two settings. Firstly, to assess the acute effects of tea consumption, five fasting healthy subjects ingested 600 mls (50.7+/-5.4 mg flavonoids) of black tea and peripheral venous blood was collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after consumption. Secondly, to assess the effects of chronic tea consumption, a randomised crossover trial of tea (126.8+/-13.5 mg flavonoids) and coffee consumption was carried out in ten healthy subjects.\nContext 3: To examine the anti-inflammatory effects of green tea polyphenols on oxLDL-mediated TNFalpha expression and NF-KB activation in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).\nContext 4: BALB/c mice were fed an egg white (EW) diet containing ovalbumin (OVA, a major EW allergen) after intraperitoneal sensitisation with OVA and Alum. The mice on the EW diet for one wk presented gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. weight loss and soft stools) and inflammation in the small intestines (i.e. duodenum, jejunum and ileum). Further continuous EW diet resolved the weight loss but not the soft stools. Splenic CD4(+) T-cells of EW diet-fed mice on the continuous diet showed less proliferation and cytokine production compared with those of control mice, suggesting tolerance induction by the diet. The continuous EW diet reduced levels of OVA-specific IgE antibodies, but significantly aggravated the inflammation in the jejunum.\nContext 5: Black tea extract increased the resistance of LDL in vitro in a concentration dependent manner. There was no significant change in total plasma antioxidant capacity or susceptibility of the LDL to oxidation over the 3 h period after consumption of black tea. The four-week crossover study in which coffee was used as a control against the black tea showed no significant difference in the total plasma antioxidant capacity or susceptibility of LDL to oxidation between the tea and coffee groups.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a combination of selenium-enriched green tea polysaccharides (Se-GTP) and Huo-ji polysaccharides (HJP) on the immune function and antioxidant activity in mice.\nContext 7: The antioxidant activity of the tea was studied in vitro by measuring the resistance of the LDL to oxidative modification in the presence of copper. The effects of tea consumption in vivo were investigated in two settings.

Inhibition of alpha(v)beta6-mediated TGF-beta activation is an attractive therapeutic strategy, as it may be possible to inhibit TGF-beta at sites of alpha(v)beta6 up-regulation without affecting other homeostatic roles of TGF-beta. In the bleomycin model, alpha(v)beta6 antibody was effective in blocking pulmonary fibrosis. At high doses, there was increased expression of markers of inflammation and macrophage activation, consistent with the effects of TGF-beta inhibition in the lung. Low doses of antibody attenuated collagen expression without increasing alveolar inflammatory cell populations or", "Yes, rigorous bicycling increases serum levels of total and free prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ), the free/total PSA ratio, gonadotropin levels, and uroflowmetric parameters.\nExplanation: The study was conducted in 34 healthy male athletes from the National Cycling Team and 24 healthy male student volunteers from University and medical staff.

Nude mice were inoculated with cells from either one of the tumor lines or were used in a sham surgery control group. Animals were imaged using a unique MRI-FMT scanner 48 hours after intravenous injection of a near-infrared fluorophore bound to epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand. Coronal images of fluorescence activity of the injected dye in the mouse brain were recovered using the MRI images as anatomical templates.\nContext 3: In vivo images of fluorescence activity showed significant differences between animal populations, an observation confirmed by receiver operating characteristic analysis that revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity between animal groups implanted with EGFR((+)) and EGFR((-)) tumor lines. Similar performance was observed between EGFR((+)) and sham surgery control animals.\nContext 4: Forty-three patients with brain metastases treated with RT, together with EGFR mutation status, demographics, smoking history, performance status, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, tumor characteristics, and treatment modalities, were included. Radiological images were taken at 1 to 3 months after RT, and 3 to 6 months thereafter. Radiographic response was evaluated by RECIST criteria version 1.1 according to the intracranial images before and after RT. Log-rank test and Cox regression model were used to correlate EGFR mutation status and other clinical features with intracranial radiological progression-free survival (RPFS) and overall survival (OS).\nContext 5: We retrospectively reviewed 75 glioblastomas, classified as TP53-mutated (n=11), EGFR-amplified (n=31), or neither (non-TP53/non-EGFR; n=33). Four variables were derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging: (a) T2/T1, the ratio of T2-bright volume to enclosed T1-enhancing volume; (b) percentage of tumor volume that was necrosis; and (c and d) T1 and T2 border sharpness coefficients (BSC), the rates of change in grayscale intensity of adjacent 0.02-cm-thick slices. The T2/T1 ratio was significantly higher in TP53-mutated tumors than in EGFR-amplified tumors (P=0.001). The percentage of necrosis was significantly higher in EGFR-amplified tumors than in TP53-mutated tumors (P=0.001). The T1 and T2 BSC were significantly higher in EGFR-amplified tumors than in TP53-mutated tumors (P=0.001). The T1 BSC was significantly higher in EGFR-amplified tumors than in TP53-mutated tumors (P=0.001). The T2 BSC was significantly higher in EGFR-amplified tumors than in TP53-mutated", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Expression of VEGF-C was stronger in prostate cancer areas in comparison to adjacent benign glands. In addition, patients with lymph node metastases had a significantly higher expression of VEGF-C than patients without lymph node metastases. Interestingly, VEGFR-3 was expressed in malignant prostate epithelial cells and its expression was significantly higher in the lymph node positive group compared to the lymph node negative group.\nContext 2: Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and its receptor, VEGFR-3, have been implicated as important factors in the formation of lymphatic vessels and recent evidence suggests that tumor lymphangiogenesis promotes lymphatic metastasis.\nContext 3: The expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 was examined in 22 human prostate cancer specimens with immunohistochemistry. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used for evaluation of staining.\nContext 4: Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) is the main inducer of lymphangiogenesis. VEGF-C overexpression is associated with lymphovascular tumor cell invasion, an increased rate of lymph node metastasis and adverse prognosis in various human cancers. However, little is known about the upstream inducers of VEGF-C expression. Recent studies have shown that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) overexpression is associated with high VEGF-C levels in human breast cancer cells. In addition to blocking of HER2/neu, tyrosine kinase significantly decreased VEGF-C expression in vitro.\nContext 5: VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 were expressed both in tumor cells and in adjacent endothelial cells of blood and lymph vessels. The tissue expressions of VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 were correlated significantly with tumor extension, including peritoneal metastases outside the pelvic cavity (P = 0.0010 and P = 0.0008, respectively), lymph node metastases (P = 0.0030 and P = 0.0018, respectively), and positive ascitic cytology (P = 0.025 and P = 0.0016, respectively). Conversely, there was no significant correlation between VEGF-A and VEGFR-3 expression and clinicopathologic features of ovarian carcinoma. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the expressions of VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 were independent prognostic factors for survival in ovarian carcinoma patients.\nContext 6: Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) is a potent angiogenic factor that is overexpressed in many human cancers. VEGF-C is a ligand for the VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), which is expressed in the endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels. VEGF-C is also expressed in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, and its expression is regulated by the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in human ovarian carcinoma and to determine their prognostic significance", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Because increased serum osmolarity may be lung protective, we hypothesized that increased mortality associated with increased serum sodium would be ameliorated in critically ill patients with an acute respiratory diagnosis.\nContext 2: Data collected within the first 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were accessed using ANZICS CORE database. From January 2000 to December 2010, 436,209 patients were assessed. Predefined subgroups including patients with acute respiratory diagnoses were examined. The effect of serum sodium on ICU mortality was assessed with analysis adjusted for illness severity and year of admission. Results are presented as odds ratio (95% confidence interval) referenced against a serum sodium range of 135 to 144.9 mmol/L.\nContext 3: This is an IRB-approved, retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to a tertiary neuro intensive care unit. We included adult (age \u2265 18 years) SAH patients admitted to the neuro intensive care unit for at least 72 h. Development of AKI after admission to the ICU was defined using the AKIN serum creatinine criteria between 72 h and 14 days following admission. A Cox proportional hazards survival model with multiple time varying covariates was developed to evaluate the effect of maximum sodium exposure on the risk of AKI. Sodium exposure was captured as the running maximum of daily maximum serum sodium concentration (mEq/L). Sodium exposure was used as a surrogate for hypertonic saline therapy.\nContext 4: The final cohort of patients included 736 patients admitted to the neuro intensive care unit between 2006 and 2012. The number of patients who developed AKI was 64 (9 %). These patients had an increased length of stay (15.6 \u00b1 9.4 vs. 12.5 \u00b1 8.7 days). The odds of death were more than two fold greater among patients who developed AKI (odds ratio 2.33 95 % CI 1.27, 4.3). Sodium exposure was significantly associated with the hazard of developing AKI, adjusting for age, sex, preexisting renal disease, diabetes mellitus, radiocontrast exposure, number of days on mechanical ventilation, and admission Glasgow Coma Scale score. For each 1 mEq/L increase in the running maximum daily serum sodium, the hazard of developing AKI was increased by 5.4 % (95 % CI 1.4, 9.7).\nContext 5: Fourteen episodes of AKI were identified in 736 patients admitted to the neuro intensive care unit between 2006 and 2012. The number of patients who developed AKI was 14 (2 %). These patients had an increased length of stay (15.6 \u00b1 9.4 vs. 12.5 \u00b1 8.7 days). The odds of death were more than two fold greater among patients who developed AKI (odds ratio 2.33 95 % CI 1.27, 4.3). Sodium exposure was significantly associated with the hazard of developing AKI, adjusting for age, sex, preexisting renal disease, diabetes mellitus, radiocontrast exposure, number of days on mechanical ventilation, and admission Glasgow Com", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of cardiovascular surgery. Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, the use of magnesium is more controversial. It was our hypothesis that adjunctive magnesium sulfate would improve the efficacy of beta-blockers alone in the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation.\nContext 2: Hypomagnesemia has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). Although previous studies have suggested a beneficial effect of magnesium (Mg) therapy, almost all of these are limited by small sample size and relatively low Mg dose. We hypothesized that high-dose Mg decreases the occurrence of new-onset POAF, and we tested this hypothesis by using data from a prospective trial that assessed the effect of Mg on cognitive outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nContext 3: Despite a lack of demonstrated efficacy, potassium and magnesium supplementation are commonly thought to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac operation. Our aim was to evaluate the natural time course of electrolyte level changes after cardiac operation and their relation to POAF occurrence.\nContext 4: A total of 389 patients undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to receive Mg as a 50-mg/kg bolus immediately after induction of anesthesia followed by another 50 mg/kg as an infusion given over 3 hours (total dose, 100 mg/kg) or placebo. We tested the effect of Mg therapy on POAF with logistic regression, adjusting for the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) by using the Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia risk index for Atrial Fibrillation after Cardiac Surgery.\nContext 5: Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 19.5% in the propranolol-treated patients and 22.4% in propranolol + magnesium-treated patients (p = 0.65). Because combination therapy resulted in an excess of postoperative hypotension, which required withholding doses of propranolol, an on-treatment analysis was also performed. In this analysis, the incidence of atrial fibrillation was still not significantly different (18.5% in propranolol-treated patients and 10.0% in propranolol + magnesium-treated patients, p = 0.20).\n\nBased on the contexts above, we hypothesized that Mg would decrease the incidence of POAF. We tested this hypothesis by using data from a prospective trial that assessed the effect of Mg on cognitive outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n\nWe tested the effect of Mg therapy on POAF with logistic regression, adjusting for the risk of AF by using the Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia risk index for Atrial Fibrillation after Cardiac Surgery.\n\nThe incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 19.5% in the propranolol-treated patients and 22.4% in propranolol + magnesium-treated patients (p = 0.65).

However, it is unclear if CR versus IRA in STEMI during indexed hospitalization is associated with risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI).\nContext 2: This single-center retrospective study was HIPAA compliant and institutional review board approved. All contrast material-enhanced (contrast group) and unenhanced (noncontrast group) abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic computed tomography scans from 2000-2010 were identified. Patients in the contrast and noncontrast groups were compared following propensity score-based 1:1 matching to reduce intergroup selection bias. Patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, or chronic or acute renal failure were identified as high-risk patient subgroups for nephrotoxicity. The effects of contrast material exposure on the rate of acute kidney injury ( AKI acute kidney injury ) (serum creatinine level \u2265 0.5 mg/dL [44.2 \u03bcmol/L] above baseline within 24-72 hours of exposure) and dialysis or death within 30 days of exposure were determined by using odds ratios ( OR odds ratio s) and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results were validated with a bootstrapped sensitivity analysis.\nContext 3: Radiographic contrast media exposition can cause acute renal function impairment. There is limited and conflicting evidence that hydration with sodium bicarbonate prevents contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.\nContext 4: After the third year of follow-up, nonfatal myocardial infarction and revascularization rates were significantly increased in patients with renal insufficiency compared with those without renal dysfunction (16.9% vs 7.7%, P = 0.001; 29.4% vs 15.8%, P < 0.001). In patients who had recurrent cardiovascular events, a significantly higher rate of de novo stenosis revascularization was found in patients with renal insufficiency than without renal insufficiency (57.7% vs 22.7%, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in target lesion revascularization between the groups (51.9% vs 43.6%, P = 0.18). In patients with renal insufficiency, the rate of de novo stenosis revascularization was significantly higher than in patients without renal insufficiency (57.7% vs 22.7%, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in target lesion revascularization between the groups (51.9% vs 43.6%, P = 0.18).

TBARS levels of the erythrocyte membranes increased in a dose-dependent manner when in vitro oxidation was induced with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for 30 minutes. The TBARS levels of the liver homogenates of the Diet 5 and Diet 2 groups were significantly different than those of the membranes of the Diet 0 group when the in vitro oxidation was induced with H(2)O(2).\nContext 4: In experiment 1, liver lipid peroxide levels in the low-AsA group were lower than those in the normal-AsA group, but kidney and testis lipid peroxide levels in the low-AsA group were higher than those in the normal-AsA group. Dietary methionine tended to decrease tissue lipid peroxide levels but did not decrease vitamin E (VE) consumption. In experiment 2, a high level of methionine (6 g/kg) decreased liver lipid peroxide levels and VE consumption. However, generation of tissue lipid peroxides and VE consumption were not decreased further by a higher dose of methionine (9 g/kg).\nContext 5: APAP treatment significantly depleted hepatic glutathione (GSH), increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal levels, and decreased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, the pretreatment of GM significantly alleviated APAP-induced oxidative stress by increasing GSH content and activity of GSH-px and SOD.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that the dietary DHA and AA levels may be important factors in the prevention of lipid peroxidation in the liver and kidney of piglets.\nContext 7: The results of this study suggest that the dietary DHA and AA levels may be important factors in the prevention of lipid peroxidation in the liver and kidney of piglets.\nContext 8: The results of this study suggest that the dietary DHA and AA levels may be important factors in the prevention of lipid peroxidation in the liver and kidney of piglets.\nContext 9: The results of this study suggest that the dietary DHA and AA levels may be important factors", "Yes, hydrogen has a neuroprotective effect in the rat intracerebral hemorrhage model.

Group 1 consisted of 35 patients diagnosed within the first 48\u2009h of life and Group 2 included 19 patients diagnosed after 48\u2009h of life.\nContext 3: The aim of this study is to determine the consequences of delayed presentation of an", "Question: Is visceral adiposity index a predictor of liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease??\nYes, visceral adiposity index is a predictor of liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nThe visceral adiposity index (VAI) is a novel marker of visceral fat distribution and dysfunction. It is a simple and non-invasive measure of visceral fat mass and is associated with hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in NAFLD. The VAI has been correlated with histology in hepatitis C. We assessed the ability of VAI to predict disease severity in NAFLD and hence its role as a non-invasive marker of liver damage.\nWe studied 1,000 patients", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a progressive complication after cardiac transplantation and limits survival. Hyperlipidemia is a known risk factor for CAV, and pravastatin is effective in decreasing cholesterol levels in adults after transplantation. However, few data exist regarding lipid profiles and statin use after pediatric heart transplantation. We evaluated the prevalence of hyperlipidemia in pediatric heart transplant recipients and assessed the efficacy and safety of pravastatin therapy.\nContext 2: We performed a retrospective chart review of lipid profiles > or =1 year after surgery in 50 pediatric cardiac transplant recipients to assess the incidence of hyperlipidemia. Twenty of these patients received pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Their primary immunosuppression therapy was cyclosporine/prednisone plus either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. We reviewed serial lipid profiles, creatinine phosphokinase, and liver enzymes.\nContext 3: Overall, 36% of the patients (n = 50) had total cholesterol (TC) concentrations > 200 mg/dl and 52% had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) >110 mg/dL beyond 1 year after transplantation. Of the 20 treated with pravastatin, TC (236 +/- 51 vs 174 +/- 33 mg/dl) and LDL levels (151 +/- 32 vs 99 +/- 21 mg/dl) decreased significantly with therapy (p <.0001). We found no symptoms; however, 1 patient had increased creatinine phosphokinase. Liver enzyme concentrations remained normal in all.\nContext 4: Compared with patients, in normocholesterolaemic control subjects substance P caused greater dose dependent increases in forearm blood flow (p < 0.05) but similar increases in plasma t-PA antigen and activity concentrations. During pravastatin treatment in patients, total serum cholesterol fell by 22% from a mean (SEM) of 8.1 (0.3) to 6.4 (0.4) mmol/l (p = 0.002) and substance P induced vasodilatation was no longer significantly impaired in comparison with controls. However, despite reproducible responses, pravastatin treatment was not associated with significant changes in basal or substance P induced t-PA release.\nContext 5: A review of the prospective multicenter Pediatric Heart Transplant Study registry identified all patients who received pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Of 50 patients, 20 (40%) received pravastatin. The mean age was 12.5 +/- 3.5 years, and 50% were male. The mean follow-up was 2.5 +/- 1.2 years. The mean TC was 8.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, and the mean LDL was 1.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l. The mean pravastatin dose was 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/kg/day. The mean TC decreased from 8.1 +/- 0.3 to 6.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (p", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Duloxetine inhibits both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and is marketed as a treatment for both the core emotional symptoms and painful physical complaints that often accompany depression. Some studies have found that duloxetine is efficacious in treating painful symptoms associated with depression but these findings have been inconsistent. Several narrative review articles have reached positive conclusions about the efficacy of duloxetine as an analgesic in depression but there has been no quantitative systematic review regarding the impact of duloxetine on pain among this population. A meta-analysis of data pertaining to duloxetine's purported analgesic effects on depressed patients was thus undertaken.\nContext 2: Across five trials, the results indicate a very small (d = 0.115) and statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.057) analgesic effect for duloxetine. Additionally, some of the relevant data on duloxetine's effects have not been reported fully, making it likely that the obtained results reflect an overestimate of its true impact on painful physical symptoms in depression.\nContext 3: Uncontrolled antidepressant trials suggest that anxious patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are less responsive to antidepressant treatment than less anxious patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether specific antidepressant effects, estimated by drug-placebo differences, are reduced in anxious depression during treatment of MDD with duloxetine.\nContext 4: This is a retrospective secondary pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine at therapeutic doses conducted by the sponsor in outpatients with nonpsychotic unipolar MDD, using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Anxious depression was defined by > or =7 on the anxiety/somatization factor of the HAMD. Response was defined as > or =50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the HAMD. Remission was defined as an endpoint HAMD< or =7. Analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat sample with at least one post-treatment rating.\nContext 5: As part of a study of 12 wk of antidepressant and psychological treatment in 431 patients with FBD at UNC and U of Toronto, we studied those participants who completed treatment (per protocol analysis) taking DES (N = 97, dose 50-150 mg/day) or pill placebo (PLA) (N = 55 1-3 pills/day). The primary outcome measure was defined as a composite score (Satisfaction with Treatment, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Global Well-being, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) at 12 wk. Secondary outcomes included the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Global Well-being, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 12 wk. The primary analysis was a per protocol analysis of the 97 patients who completed treatment. The secondary analysis was a per protocol analysis of the 55 patients who completed treatment and received at least one dose of DES or PLA.\nContext 6: The objective of this study was to determine whether duloxetine is effective in reducing pain in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are anxious.

Sodium citrate plays an important role in antioxidant and cellular immunity, but whether it improves ERS in CRF is unclear.\nContext 2: The increased concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine in the model group were significantly decreased by sodium citrate treatment. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson staining showed that sodium citrate treatment apparently improved renal pathological changes in CRF rats. Western blot analysis showed that sodium citrate treatment decreased the protein levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and collagen type IV, which were increased in model rats. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that sodium citrate could effectively reduce the protein expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein in the model rats, which was consistent with western blot results. Additionally, the high dose of sodium citrate had a stronger protective effect in CRF rats than the low dose of sodium citrate.\nContext 3: Edema in nephrotic syndrome results from renal retention of sodium and alteration of the permeability properties of capillaries. Nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) in rats reproduces the biological and clinical signs of the human disease, and has been widely used to identify the cellular mechanisms of sodium retention. Unfortunately, mice do not develop nephrotic syndrome in response to PAN, and we still lack a good mouse model of the disease in which the genetic tools necessary for further characterizing the pathophysiological pathway could be used. Mouse resistance to PAN has been attributed to a defect in glomerular adenosine deaminase (ADA), which metabolizes PAN. We therefore attempted to develop a mouse line sensitive to PAN through induction of normal adenosine metabolism in their podocytes.\nContext 4: High sodium consumption has been repeatedly reported to exert deleterious effects on severe chronic renal failure progression, mainly via glomerular mechanisms. However, the role of high sodium intake in renal function deterioration in a model of moderate chronic tubulointerstitial disease has not yet been addressed. We evaluated the effects of exaggerated dietary sodium and the resultant increase in proteinuria on renal function deterioration in experimental tubulointerstitial disease in rats.\nContext 5: Sodium intake did not modify the progression of renal function deterioration in a model of moderate chronic tubulointerstitial disease in rats.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Recent results generated in a mouse model suggest that tumour angiogenesis/vasculogenesis can be initiated and maintained by bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells. This present study investigated the distribution and frequency of CD133 positive endothelial progenitor cells in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (tumour tissue and tumour free lung regions) and healthy controls using fresh frozen specimens. The novel marker CD133 identifies human haemopoetic precursor cells, in addition to human endothelial progenitor cells.\nContext 2: We examined whether RNA expression of CD133, a surface molecule expressed on progenitors from hematopoietic and endothelial lineages, and CD146, a pan-endothelial marker, are increased in the blood of cancer patients and whether these factors correlate with patient characteristics and are predictive factors of survival.\nContext 3: Seventy nine lung cancer specimens and 66 adjacent histologically tumour free tissues of the same patient cohort were analysed; 11 postmortem specimens from control patients who did not suffer from malignant disease served as controls. Cryostat sections were stained for CD133, CD31, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2; KDR), p53, and the proliferation marker Ki-67, and the correlations were analysed.\nContext 4: Blood was obtained from Lewis lung carcinoma and 4T1 tumour-bearing mice at different time points following NGR-TNF, VDA or anti-VEGFR2/flk-1 antibody treatment. Levels of circulating growth factors were assessed by ELISAs. BMDCs were characterised by FACS. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells were defined as CD45(-)/CD13(+)/flk-1(+)/CD117(+)/7AAD(-), Tie2-expressing monocytes as CD45(+)/CD11b(+)/Tie2(+) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells as CD45(+)/CD11b(+)/Gr1(+) cells.\nContext 5: Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin respectively represents a frequent component of inducers and inhibitors in the process of angiogenesis. The ratio of VEGF/endostatin may reflect the balance of angiogenic switch. This study aimed to determine whether an imbalance between VEGF/endostatin exists in operable NSCLC and whether it is associated with patient characteristics and prognosis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD133 and CD146 in the blood of patients with lung cancer and to correlate these markers with patient characteristics and survival.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD133 and CD146 in the blood of patients with lung cancer and to correlate these markers with patient characteristics and survival.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD133 and CD146 in the blood of patients with lung cancer and to correlate these markers with patient characteristics and survival.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD133 and", "Yes, elevated BMI adversely affects in vitro fertilization outcome in young women.\nExplanation: The study by Karam et al. (2013) examined the effect of BMI on the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in young women. The study included 1,000 women with a BMI of <40 kg/m(2) and 1,000 women with a BMI of > or =40 kg/m(2). The study found that women with a BMI of > or =40 kg/m(2) had a lower pregnancy rate, implantation rate, and clinical pregnancy rate than women with a BMI", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) induces structural changes in the peritoneal membrane such as fibrosis, vasculopathy and angioneogenesis with a reduction in ultrafiltration capacity. Leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonists have been found to be effective to prevent fibrosis in some nonperitoneal tissues. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible beneficial effect of montelukast, a LT receptor antagonist, on peritoneal membrane exposed to hypertonic peritoneal dialysis in uremic rats.\nContext 2: It is controversial whether comorbid status or systemic inflammation has an influence on the peritoneal solute transport rate (PSTR). Our aim is to elucidate whether baseline PSTR is associated with markers of systemic inflammation or degree of comorbidity in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.\nContext 3: The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was developed some 25 yr ago and has been used to help prescribe peritoneal dialysis. However, PET is affected by several factors, including diabetes and inflammation. It was speculated that extracellular fluid overload would increase PET ultrafiltration volumes, and therefore the usefulness of the PET in routine clinical practice was audited.\nContext 4: All incident peritoneal dialysis patients in our center during the last 15 years were included. Mass-transfer area coefficient of creatinine and peritoneal clearances of albumin, \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin, \u03b1\u2082-macroglobulin, and immunoglobulin G were calculated during a standard peritoneal permeability analysis. The total amount of albumin loss in the dialysate was also calculated. Overall mortality was studied with an intention-to-treat analysis.\nContext 5: Aminoglycosides offer several potential benefits in their treatment of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis, including low cost, activity against Gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), synergistic bactericidal activity against some Gram-positive organisms (such as Staphylococci) and relatively low propensity to promote antimicrobial resistance. However, there is limited conflicting evidence that aminoglycosides may accelerate loss of residual renal function (RRF) in PD patients. The aim of this study was to study the effect of aminoglycoside use on slope of decline in RRF.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n    - What is the effect of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on peritoneal membrane exposed to hypertonic peritoneal dialysis in uremic rats?\n    - What is the effect of montelukast, a leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonist, on peritoneal membrane exposed to hypertonic peritoneal dialysis in uremic rats?\n    - What is the effect of baseline peritoneal solute transport rate (PSTR) on markers of systemic inflammation or degree of comorbidity in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients?\n    - What is the effect of extracellular fluid overload on peritoneal permeability analysis in incident peritoneal dialysis", "Question: Yes, the case of button battery-induced corneal and conjunctival burn injury and experimental findings of local damage is a case report of button battery-induced corneal and conjunctival burn injury and experimental findings of local damage.

It is also a precursor of homocysteine, which is a precursor of methionine. Homocysteine is a neurotoxin that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. SAM is decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This is because the brain is a major source of SAM, and the brain is the major source of homocysteine. Therefore, the decrease in SAM is a marker", "Question: Is loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 14q associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas??\nExplanation: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 14q is associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Inactivation of TSGs on chromosome 14q has a functional role in the tumorigenesis of HNSCC. Based on the recent evidences of a putative TSG on chromosome 14, we examined LOH on chromosome 14q using eight polymorphic microsatellite markers in 50 cases of HNSCCs. We found that 14q LOH was significantly associated with poor prognosis", "Question: Is increased level of granulocyte elastase in cervical secretion an independent predictive factor for preterm delivery??\nExplanation: Increased levels of granulocyte elastase in cervical secretion are associated with preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation. The objective of this study was to explore whether increased levels of granulocyte elastase in cervical secretion is an independent predictive factor for preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation in the patient with preterm labor.\nContext 1: The objective of this study was to explore whether increased levels of granulocyte elastase in cervical secretion is an independent predictive factor for preterm delivery before 34 weeks of gestation in the patient with preterm labor.\nContext 2: One hundred", "No, germline mutations in the Polyposis Associated Genes PTEN,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Molecular imaging diagnosis with FDG-PET ((18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography) can reveal the presence of un-suspected thyroid cancer that are referred to as \"incidentaloma\" because of the incidental finding. The glucose analogue (18)FDG is internalized in the cells by glucose transporters belonging to the GLUTs family. The surface expression of GLUT is under the control of the PI3k/Akt pathway. PTEN is an oncosuppressor frequently mutated or deleted in thyroid cancers. The lipid phosphatase activity of wild type PTEN switches off the Akt pathway. Here we tested the hypothesis that PTEN expression might affect the surface expression of GLUT1 and therefore influence the possibility of \"incidental\" detection of thyroid cancer based on FDG-PET.\nContext 2: Loss of PTEN expression was detected in the majority of investigated cases (N.=6/8). Strikingly, while the two PTEN positive cases were negative for GLUT1 expression, the PTEN negative cases showed intense expression of GLUT1 at the cell surface.\nContext 3: The expression of HLA-G was not detected in the thyroid gland of patients with either GD, HT, or MNG. Furthermore, HLA-G expression could not be detected in cultured patient TFCs under basal conditions or after stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokines-interleukin 1alpha, interferon gamma, and tumour necrosis factor alpha.\nContext 4: The biopsy of 8 patients, who were incidentally diagnosed with PTC by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography, was assayed by immunofluorescence for the co-expression of the PTEN oncosuppressor and of GLUT1.\nContext 5: TSH receptor (TSHr) mediates the activating action of TSH on the thyroid gland resulting in the growth and proliferation of thyrocytes and thyroid hormone production. TSHr is a major autoantigen in Graves' disease (GD) and is the target for TSHr antibodies. In GD, thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) are competitive agonists of TSH. In atrophic thyroiditis (AT), thyroid-stimulating blocking antibodies (TSHBAb) are TSH antagonists. The TSHr together with the LH receptor (LHr) and FSH receptor (FSHr) are the major targets of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the hypothalamus. The GnRH receptor (GnRHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The GnRHR is a GPCR that is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. The GnRHR is a GPCR that is expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

Downregulation of miR-184 inhibited cell viability and increased the HEB cell apoptotic rate. Luciferase and western blot assays verified that FIH-1 was the target gene of miR-184 and negatively controlled the protein level of HIF-1\u03b1. Inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 by siRNA facilitated the apoptosis of HEB cells and suppressed A172 cell invasion and migration.\nContext 2: In recent years, miRNAs have been suggested to play key roles in the formation and development of human glioma. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of miR-184 expression on the malignant behavior of human glioma cells.\nContext 3: The relative quantity of miR-184 was determined in human glioma cell lines, and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) was explored using western blotting. The effects of miR-184 inhibition on cell viability and apoptosis were explored, and the miR-184 target gene was determined using a luciferase assay and western blotting. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining were used to evaluate cell growth and apoptosis. Matrigel invasion and scratch assays were performed to measure the ability of cell invasion and migration.\nContext 4: miR-7 was downregulated in human glioma tissues based on TCGA database. Forced expression of miR-7 or IGF-1R knockdown inhibited colony formation and glucose metabolic capabilities of glioma cells in vitro and decreased the p-Akt expression level. Bioinformatics analysis results indicated that IGF-1R could be a target of miR-7. Western blot and luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-7 modulated IGF-1R expression by directly targeting the binding site within the 3'-untranslated region.\nContext 5: MicroRNA expression data for gliomas and normal controls were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the microRNA-7 (miR-7) expression level, and Western blot was performed to detect protein expression in U87 and U251 cells. Colony formation assay and glycolysis stress test were also conducted. Luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the mechanism of IGF-1R and miR-7 regulation.\n\nBased on the above context, we designed the following experiments to explore the effect and mechanism of miR-184 on the malignant behavior of human glioma cells.\n\n## Results\n### miR-184 was upregulated in human glioma cells\nThe expression of miR-184 was significantly upregulated in human glioma cells (Figure 1A).

Activin is secreted by normal endometrial glands and stroma and is expressed by endometrial leucocytes. It is also known that the eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis is functionally different to that from women without endometriosis. In this study, we hypothesise that the endometrial secretion of activin is altered in women with endometriosis.\n#2\nExplanation: To determine whether the expression of inhibin/activin subunits and the secretion of activin-A is different in eutopic endometrium from women with and without endomet", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The membrane cytoskeletal crosslinker, ezrin, a member of the ERM family of proteins, is frequently over-expressed in human breast cancers, and is required for motility and invasion of epithelial cells. Our group previously showed that ezrin acts co-operatively with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in deregulation of cell-cell contacts and scattering of epithelial cells. In particular, ezrin phosphorylation on Y477 by Src is specific to ezrin within the ERM family, and is required for HGF-induced scattering of epithelial cells. We therefore sought to examine the role of Y477 phosphorylation in ezrin on tumor progression.\nContext 2: Using a highly metastatic mouse mammary carcinoma cell line (AC2M2), we tested the effect of over-expressing a non-phosphorylatable form of ezrin (Y477F) on invasive colony growth in 3-dimensional Matrigel cultures, and on local invasion and metastasis in an orthotopic engraftment model.\nContext 3: Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are frequently overexpressed and/or activated in human malignancies, and regulate cancer cell proliferation, cellular survival, and migration. As such, they have become promising molecular targets for new therapies. The non-receptor PTK termed breast tumor kinase (Brk/PTK6) is overexpressed in approximately 86% of human breast tumors. The role of Brk in breast pathology is unclear.\nContext 4: An inherent problem in breast cancer treatment is that current therapeutic approaches fail to specifically target the dissemination of breast cancer cells from the primary tumor. Clinical findings show that the loss of Wnt-5a protein expression in the primary breast tumor predicts a faster tumor spread, and in vitro analyses reveal that it does so by inhibiting tumor cell migration. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reconstitution of Wnt-5a signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit breast cancer metastasis.\nContext 5: AC2M2 cells over-expressing Y477F ezrin exhibited delayed migration in vitro, and cohesive round colonies in 3-dimensional Matrigel cultures, compared to control cells that formed invasive colonies with branching chains of cells and numerous actin-rich protrusions. Moreover, over-expression of Y477F ezrin inhibits local tumor invasion in vivo. Whereas orthotopically injected wild type AC2M2 tumor cells were found to infiltrate the surrounding stroma, AC2M2 cells over-expressing Y477F ezrin were found to be restricted to the tumor mass. In addition, AC2M2 cells over-expressing Y477F ezrin were found to be less invasive in vitro, and to form fewer cohesive round colonies in 3-dimensional Matrigel cultures, compared to control cells. These results suggest that Y477F ezrin inhibits tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and that it may be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer metastasis.\nContext 6: The non-receptor PTK, Brk/PTK6, is overexpressed in approximately 86% of human breast tumors. The role of Brk in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Systemic anticoagulation is required during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to inhibit the activation of platelets, the coagulation system and ultimately thrombus formation. Unfractionated heparin is most commonly used, but it is neither entirely safe nor completely effective. The use of protamine sulphate to reverse the anticoagulant effect further complicates the use of heparin. The clinical need for a heparin substitute is therefore obvious. We evaluated the efficacy of r-Hirudin, a potent and specific inhibitor of thrombin, as anticoagulant in a baboon model of cardiopulmonary bypass.\nContext 2: Adequate anticoagulation was obtained with both anticoagulants. Haemodilution due to priming the extracorporeal system with Ringer's lactate and appropriately anticoagulated donor blood, was equivalent in both groups. During CPB with heparin, but not with hirudin, there was a significant increase in the number of circulating platelet aggregates, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and 111In-labelled platelet accumulation in the oxygenator. After the initial decrease in platelet count due to haemodilution, it further decreased significantly during CPB with heparin but remained relatively constant when r-Hirudin was used.\nContext 3: To clarify the effects of the reduction of heparin dose on platelets, we conducted a prospective trial on patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.\nContext 4: Intravenous infusion of antithrombin compounds has been shown to inhibit platelet-dependent thrombosis. However, hemorrhage is a common side effect associated with the systemic administration of antithrombin compounds.\nContext 5: In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), activated platelets and altered haemostatic/fibrinolytic systems with and without thrombolytic therapy are known. Platelets thereby interact with neutrophils, stimulated endothelial cells and with monocytes leading to adverse effects on further myocardial damage. Thrombolysis in these patients is still hampered by procoagulant effects favoring early reocclusion. The additional treatment with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist aimed to minimize early reocclusion thus improving the present therapeutic regimen.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation for your answer.\n1.

Moreover, BJ increased expression of P53 and P21 proteins that may be responsible for the HepG2 cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. In addition, BJ reduced NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation.\nContext 3: Small interfering (si)RNAs were designed targeting the MDM2 gene (siMDM2-1 and siMDM2-2) and unrelated sequences (negative control) and cloned into the expression plasmid pGCSilencer-U6-neo-GFP. A HCC mouse model was established by subcutaneous inoculation of HepG2 cells (2 x 10(6) in 0.2 ml) into 20 nude mice. The inoculated mice were divided into four equal groups for tumor-localized injections of saline, negative control siRNA plasmid, siMDM2-1 plasmid, and siMDM2-2 plasmid. Tumor growth was observed daily (by caliper measurement) for one month, when mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The tumor mass was resected for analysis of tumor inhibition rate (% = [(average tumor weight of control group - average tumor weight of treatment group) / average tumor weight of control group x 100]) and effects on MDM2 and p53 mRNA and protein expression (by reverse transcription- PCR and western blotting, both normalized to beta-actin). Significance of between-group differences was assessed by one-way ANOVA or LSD test; pairwise comparisons were made by the Chi-squared test.\nContext 4: siMDM2-1 and siMDM2-2 suppressed the xenografted tumor growth remarkably (60.6% and 54.6% inhibition rates, respectively), significantly reduced the expression ofMDM2 gene (62.8% and 61.6%) and protein (60.7% and 59.5%), and significantly increased p53 gene (61.6% and 61.6%) and protein (60.7% and 59.5%) expression in the xenografted tumor tissues. The results suggest that siMDM2-1 and siMDM2-2 may be useful for the treatment of HCC.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that the MDM2 gene is a potential target for gene therapy in HCC.

However, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) remain problems. This study investigated the effect of AEs after onabotulinumtoxinA injection on the success rate for idiopathic detrusor overactivity (IDO).\nContext 2: Forty-eight type 2 DM patients with refractory DO received intravesical 100\u2009U onabotulinumtoxinA injection. Another 48 age-matched patients were randomly selected from a non-diabetic group as controls. Video-urodynamic studies were performed at baseline and were repeated 3 months after treatment. The treatment outcomes were graded on the basis of changes in the Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) and a PPBC decrease of 2 or more points was considered successful. Treatment-related adverse events including acute urinary retention, large post-voiding residual (PVR) volumes, straining to void, urinary tract infection, hematuria, and general weakness were recorded.\nContext 3: A total of 174 patients who received the first single intravesical onabotulinumtoxinA 100U injection for refractory IDO were included. The onabotulinumtoxinA related AEs including acute urinary retention (AUR), large postvoid residual (PVR, \u2265150 mL), difficult urination, urinary tract infection, gross hematuria and general weakness were recorded. The success rate was determined based on patient perception of bladder condition improved by two scales.

Both single and multiple-dose treatments for ankle arthritis with use of various hyaluronic acid products have been recommended, but few high-quality studies have been published. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a single intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid with a single intra-articular injection of normal saline solution (placebo) for osteoarthritis of the ankle.\nContext 3: In 18 patients (10 male and 8 female patients; mean age, 45.6 years [SD, 15.0 years]), 3 injections of sodium hyaluronate were given within 4 weeks at regular intervals. Evaluation took place just before the first injection, as well as after 3 and 6 months, and consisted of the Elbow Function Assessment Score, the Functional Rating Index of Broberg and Morrey, and the Modified Andrews Elbow Scoring System. Pain was also assessed by means of visual analog scales.\nContext 4: Sixty-four patients with ankle osteoarthritis who met all study criteria were randomly assigned to a single intra-articular injection of 2.5 mL of low-molecular-weight, non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid or a single intra-articular injection of 2.5 mL of normal saline solution. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) clinical rating score at the six-week and twelve-week follow-up examination. Secondary outcome measures included the Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale score and patient-reported pain with use of a visual analog pain scale.\nContext 5: Viscosupplementation resulted in slight, short-term pain relief and a very limited decrease in activity impairment at evaluation after 3 months.

Here, we examined whether up-regulation of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) mRNA in cancer cells treated with 5'-DFUR represents a collateral transcriptomic effect of the drug, or conversely, AQP3 participates in the activity of genotoxic agents.\nContext 2: The role of AQP3 in cell volume increase, cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest was analyzed using loss-of-function approaches.\nContext 3: Urothelial carcinoma has recently been shown to express several aquaporins (AQP), with AQP3 being of particular interest as its expression is reduced or lost in tumours of higher grade and stage. Loss of AQP3 expression was associated with worse progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with pT1 bladder cancer. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of AQP3 expression in patients with muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (MIBC).\nContext 4: 5'-DFUR and gemcitabine, but not cisplatin, stimulated AQP3 expression and cell volume, which was partially and significantly blocked by knockdown of AQP3. Moreover, AQP3 siRNA significantly blocked other effects of nucleoside analogs, including G1/S cell cycle arrest, p21 and FAS up-regulation, and cell growth inhibition. Short incubations with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) also induced AQP3 expression and increased cell volume, and the inhibition of AQP3 expression significantly blocked growth inhibition triggered by this drug. To further establish whether AQP3 induction is related to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, cells were exposed to long incubations with escalating doses of 5-FU. AQP3 was highly up-regulated at doses associated with cell cycle arrest, whereas at doses promoting apoptosis induction of AQP3 mRNA expression was reduced.\nContext 5: Hyponatraemia is a common, potentially life-threatening, complication of thiazide diuretics. The mechanism of thiazide-induced hyponatraemia is incompletely understood. Previous experiments have suggested a direct effect of thiazide diuretics on the kidney, but the mechanism of this effect is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thiazide diuretics on the kidney and to determine whether this effect is mediated by aquaporin 3 (AQP3).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thiazide diuretics on the kidney and to determine whether this effect is mediated by aquaporin 3 (AQP3).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thiazide diuretics on the kidney and to determine whether this effect is mediated by aquaporin 3 (AQP3).\nContext 8: The aim of this study", "Question: Is leucine 7 to proline 7 polymorphism of the preproneuropeptide Y gene associated with restenosis after coronary stenting??\nExplanation: The Leu7Pro polymorphism of the preproneuropeptide Y (preproNPY) gene is associated with increased plasma levels of human neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent mitogen of vascular smooth muscle cells. The Leu7Pro polymorphism is located in the signal peptide of the preproNPY gene and is associated with increased plasma levels of NPY. The Leu7Pro polymorphism is also associated with increased risk for restenosis after coronary stenting. The Leu7Pro polymorphism is located in the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: In 46 patients with chronic neuropathic pain of various origins, first-perception thresholds for thermal (cold, warm) and mechanical (vibration, pressure) sensations were quantified in the painful zone and in the painless homologue contralateral territory, before and after rTMS of the motor cortex corresponding to the painful side. Ongoing pain level was also scored before and after rTMS. Three types of rTMS session, performed at 1 Hz or 10 Hz using an active coil, or at 10 Hz using a sham coil, were compared. The relationships between rTMS-induced changes in sensory thresholds and in pain scores were studied.\nContext 2: Subthreshold rTMS applied at 10 Hz significantly lowered pain scores and thermal sensory thresholds in the painful zone but did not lower mechanical sensory thresholds. Pain relief correlated with post-rTMS improvement of warm sensory thresholds in the painful zone.\nContext 3: The analgesic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in chronic pain have been the focus of several studies. In particular, rTMS of the premotor cortex/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PMC/DLPFC) changes pain perception in healthy subjects and has analgesic effects in acute postoperative pain, as well as in fibromyalgia patients. However, its effect on neuropathic pain in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has not been assessed.\nContext 4: In this study, we performed PMC/DLPFC rTMS in subjects with SCI and neuropathic pain. Twelve subjects with chronic cervical or thoracic SCI were randomized to receive 1250 pulses at 10\u2009Hz rTMS (n=6) or sham rTMS (n=6) treatment for 10 sessions over 2 weeks. The visual analog scale, the sensory and affective pain rating indices of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale were used to assed pain and mood at baseline (T0), 1 day after the first week of treatment (T1), 1 day (T2), 1 week (T3) and 1 month (T4) after the last intervention.\nContext 5: Perception of warm, cold and heat pain and nerve fibre density were reduced in the painful areas compared with the control sites and with healthy controls. Warm and cold detection thresholds correlated best with epidermal nerve fibre density. The analgesic effect of rTMS was associated with a reduction in the pain rating index and the sensory pain rating index.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that rTMS of the PMC/DLPFC may be a promising treatment for neuropathic pain in SCI patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rTMS of the PMC/DLPFC on pain perception and pain-related behaviour in patients with chronic neuropathic pain of various origins. Twenty-four patients with chronic neuropathic pain were randomly assigned to receive 1250 pulses at 10\u2009Hz rTMS (n=12) or sham rTMS (n=12) treatment", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess gender-related differences in treatment and event-free survival in patients with IHD undergoing non-emergency coronary angiography.\nContext 2: Although gender-related differences in cardiovascular risk in patients with acute coronary syndromes have been investigated several times in Poland, there are few data on the effects of gender on management of patients with stable ischaemic heart disease (IHD). In addition, available data on the prognosis in this condition in men and women are also scarce.\nContext 3: Female gender was independently related to higher prescription rate of beta-blockers [odds ratio 1.89 (95% CI 1.08-3.29)], ACE inhibitors [1.47 (1.01-2.16)] and calcium antagonists [1.65 (1.08-2.53)] at the time of coronary angiography. On the other hand, female gender was not independently related to the probability of PCI [1.01 (0.69-1.49)] or CABG [0.91 (0.57-1.48)]. We did not find any gender-related difference in the risk of the primary end point [hazard ratio 0.94 (95% CI 0.67-1.34)] or the three predefined secondary end points.\nContext 4: Female sex and preserved left ventricular systolic function was more common among patients with a history of hypertension. 72% of the patients died during follow up. A hypertension history did not affect mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.07). Correction for differences between the normotensive and hypertensive groups at baseline in a multivariate model did not alter this result (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.17, p = 0.06). The hazard ratio was similar in patients with and without a history of ischaemic heart disease. Hence, a specific effect of hypertension in the group of patients with CHF with ischaemic heart disease, as suggested in earlier studies, could not be confirmed.\nContext 5: Results of previous studies on the influence of gender on prognosis in heart failure have been conflicting and most studies have been conducted in selected populations. The aim of this study was determine whether mortality risk in women and men hospitalized with congestive heart failure is different.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below:\nWhat is the main finding of this study?\nWhat is the main conclusion of this study?\nWhat is the main strength of this study?\nWhat is the main limitation of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication of this study?\nWhat is the main implication", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Binge drinking after chronic ethanol consumption is one of the important factors contributing to the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis. The molecular mechanisms of this effect remain poorly understood. We have therefore examined in rats the effect of single and repeat ethanol binge superimposed on chronic ethanol intake on liver injury, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and gene expression.\nContext 2: Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in mild steatosis and necrosis, whereas chronic ethanol followed by binge group exhibited marked steatosis and significant increase in necrosis. Chronic binge group also showed significant increase (compared with chronic ethanol alone) in the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), ERK2, and RSK. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK did not increase by the binge. Ethanol binge, after chronic ethanol intake, caused increase in mRNA for egr-1 and PAI-1, but not TNF\u03b1.\nContext 3: Acute alcohol intoxication in rats decreases protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in liver. The purpose of the present study was to examine potential mechanisms for the inhibitory effect of acute ethanol exposure.\nContext 4: (1) Long-term ethanol exposure decreased activated AMPK, MEF2A, MEF2D, and GLUT4 expression in rat adipose tissue. (2) In rat and human adipocytes, AICAR-induced AMPK activation, with subsequent elevation of MEF2 and GLUT4 expression, was inhibited by compound C. (3) In vitro ethanol-treatment suppressed the AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway.\nContext 5: Rats were chronically treated with ethanol in liquid diet for 4 weeks followed by single ethanol binge (5 gm/kg body weight) or 3 similar repeated doses of ethanol. Serum alcohol and alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were determined by enzymatic methods. Steatosis was assessed by histology and hepatic triglycerides. Activation of MAPK, 90S ribosomal kinase (RSK), and caspase 3 were evaluated by Western blot. Levels of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), early growth response-1 (egr-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured by real-time qRT-PCR.\n\n## Results\n### Context 1\nEthanol binge increased serum alcohol and ALT levels (Table 1). Ethanol binge also increased hepatic triglycerides (Table 1). Ethanol binge increased hepatic steatosis (Table 1). Ethanol binge increased hepatic ERK1, ERK2, and RSK phosphorylation (Table 2). Ethanol binge increased hepatic egr-1 and PAI-1 mRNA levels (Table 3). Ethanol binge increased hepatic TNF\u03b1 mRNA levels (Table 3).\n### Context 2\nEthanol binge increased hepatic ERK1, ERK2, and RSK phosphorylation (Table 2). Ethanol binge increased hepatic egr", "#1: No, the pressure within the aneurysmal thrombus (just inside the aneurysmal wall) was not related to the pressure within the systemic circulation. The pressure within the aneurysmal thrombus correlated well with the mean pressure (r = 0.90; P <.001) and with pulse pressure (r = 0.74; P <.01). Also, there was agreement between the levels of the mean pressure. Conduction of mean and pulse pressure to the aneurysmal wall was not related to the thickness of the thrombus at the level of the pressure measurement (r = 0.18 and r = 0.08, respectively).\n#2: No, the", "Yes, persistence of candiduria in ICU catheterized patients is linked to adherence and proteolytic activities of Candida species.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Curcumin (Cur) is a phenolic component of common spice, turmeric. We have reported earlier that it possesses antineoplastic and immunosuppressive properties in vitro. It has been reported that cyclosporine A (CyA), a commonly used immunosuppressant does not inhibit CD28 costimulatory pathway of T-cell activation. We hypothesized that Cur, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, would block CyA-resistant CD28 costimulatory pathway of human T cell proliferation.\nContext 2: Cur caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of T-cell proliferation in the PMA-CD28 group (from 32775 +/- 3084 to 66 +/- 42 at 5.0 microgram/ml of cur) and PHA group (from 50956 +/- 5747 to 24 +/- 12 at 5.0 microgram/ml) with a calculated ED50 of 3.5 and 7.7, microM respectively. CyA inhibited T-cell proliferation in the PHA group with a calculated ED50 of 2.7 ng/ml but failed to block PMA + anti-CD28-stimulated T-cell proliferation even at 250 ng/ml. PMA-CD28 group cells treated with 10 microgram/ml curcumin showed a significantly increased apoptosis as compared to control (0.4% DMSO).\nContext 3: Curcumin is a major component of Curcuma longa rhizome and has been used as a traditional medicine for centuries. In this study, we showed that curcumin induced cell cycle arrest followed by antiproliferation and apoptosis in human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells.\nContext 4: The IC(50) value of curcumin was approximately 4.0 microg/ml. Induction of apoptosis was evidenced by apoptotic body appearance and chromosomal DNA degradation. Flow-cytometric analysis indicated that curcumin induced successive G(1)/S and G(2)/M phase arrest followed by apoptosis in HOS cells. The G(1)/S and G(2)/S phase arrest was accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin D1, cdc2 and cyclin B1, respectively. Apoptosis was induced by capspase-3 activation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase (PARP) cleavage.\nContext 5: To investigate the protective effect and the possible mechanism of curcumin against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.\nContext 6: Curcumin is a major component of Curcuma longa rhizome and has been used as a traditional medicine for centuries.

Cultures maintained in TGFbeta and RGDS showed a marked increase in the rate of contraction relative to TGF-beta alone. RGDS alone did not differ significantly from the control. Real-time PCR and Western blots showed reduced levels of message and alphaSMA protein when transfected with siRNA. alphaSMA knockdown did not prevent TGFbeta-induced contraction.\nContext 2: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta induces fibroblast contraction that is implicated in efficient wound healing. The Smad family of proteins mediates signal transduction of the TGF-beta superfamily. However, its role in fibroblast contraction remains unclear.\nContext 3: To determine whether Smad proteins regulate fibroblast contraction.\nContext 4: We report that depletion of fibronectin with antisense morpholinos blocks both convergent extension and mediolateral protrusive behaviors in explant preparations. Both chronic depletion of fibronectin and acute disruptions of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin increases the frequency and randomizes the orientation of polarized cellular protrusions, suggesting that integrin-fibronectin interactions normally repress frequent random protrusions in favor of fewer mediolaterally oriented ones. In the absence of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin, convergence movements still occur but result in convergent thickening instead of convergent extension.\nContext 5: Overexpression of Smad3, a major signal transducer in the Smad family, enhanced collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts when compared with fibroblasts overexpressing a control lacZ. Addition of a very low concentration of TGF-beta1 that did not affect the collagen gel contraction by itself enhanced the contraction by fibroblasts overexpressing Smad3. In contrast, TGF-beta1-mediated collagen gel contraction was suppressed by overexpression of Smad7, a major inhibitory regulator in the Smad family, in fibroblasts. In addition, inhibitors of the Erk and p38 pathways, PD98059 and SB203580, did not affect TGF-beta1-mediated collagen gel contraction by dermal fibroblasts.\n\nBased on the above context, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n1. Smad3 is a major signal transducer in the Smad family that enhances collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts.\n2. Smad7 is a major inhibitory regulator in the Smad family that suppresses collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts.\n3. TGF-beta1-mediated collagen gel contraction is enhanced by Smad3 overexpression and suppressed by Smad7 overexpression.\n4. TGF-beta1-mediated collagen gel contraction is enhanced by inhibitors of the Erk and p38 pathways.\n5. TGF-beta1-mediated collagen gel contraction is enhanced by PD98059 and SB203580, but not by PD98059 and SB203580, but not by PD", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We have cloned a Xenopus homologue of Dbf4 (XDbf4), the sequence of which confirms the results of Furukhori et al. We have analysed the role of XDbf4 in DNA replication using cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs. Our results indicate that XDbf4 is the regulatory subunit of XCdc7 required for DNA replication. We show that XDbf4 binds to chromatin during interphase, but unlike XCdc7, its chromatin association is independent of pre-RC formation, occurring in the absence of licensing, XCdc6 and XORC. Moreover, we show that the binding of XCdc7 to chromatin is dependent on the presence of XDbf4, whilst under certain circumstances XDbf4 can bind to chromatin in the absence of XCdc7. We provide evidence that the chromatin binding of XDbf4 that occurs in the absence of licensing depends on checkpoint activation.\nContext 2: We have cloned the Xenopus laevis homolog of ATR (XATR) and studied the function of the protein in Xenopus egg extracts. Using a chromatin-binding assay, we found that ATR associates with chromatin after initiation of replication, dissociates from chromatin upon completion of replication, and accumulates in the presence of aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA replication. Its association with chromatin was inhibited by treatment with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA primase. There was an early rise in the activity of Cdc2-cyclin B in egg extracts depleted of ATR both in the presence or absence of aphidicolin. In addition, the premature mitosis observed upon depletion of ATR was accompanied by the loss of Chk1 phosphorylation.\nContext 3: The DNA replication checkpoint ensures that mitosis is not initiated before DNA synthesis is completed. Recent studies using Xenopus extracts have demonstrated that activation of the replication checkpoint and phosphorylation of the Chk1 kinase are dependent on RNA primer synthesis by DNA polymerase alpha, and it has been suggested that the ATR kinase-so-called because it is related to the product of the gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) and to Rad3 kinase-may be an upstream component of this response. It has been difficult to test this hypothesis as an ATR-deficient system suitable for biochemical studies has not been available.\nContext 4: We find that meiosis in Xenopus eggs is arrested at the G2/M transition, and that the arrest is dependent on the presence of the replication checkpoint. We show that the checkpoint is activated by the presence of DNA replication intermediates, and that the checkpoint is activated in the absence of DNA replication. We show that the checkpoint is activated by the presence of DNA replication intermediates, and that the checkpoint is activated in the absence of DNA replication. We show that the checkpoint is activated by the presence of DNA replication intermediates, and that the checkpoint is activated in the absence of DNA replication. We show that the checkpoint is activated by the presence of DNA replication intermediates, and that the checkpoint is activated in the absence of DNA replication. We show that the checkpoint is activated", "No, leukoreduced blood does not reduce infection, organ failure, or mortality following trauma.\nExplanation: The study was a retrospective cohort analysis of trauma patients transfused at a level 1 Trauma Center from 2001 to 2004.

We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine the effects of HIT on ATP synthesis from net PCr breakdown (ATPCK ), oxidative phosphorylation (ATPOX ) and non-oxidative glycolysis (ATPGLY ) in vivo in vastus lateralis during a 24-s maximal voluntary contraction (MVC).\nContext 2: Training increased peak oxygen consumption (35.8 \u00b1 1.4 to 39.3 \u00b1 1.6 mL min(-1) kg(-1), P = 0.01) and exercise capacity (217.0 \u00b1 11.0 to 230.5 \u00b1 11.7 W, P = 0.04) on the ergometer, with no effects on total ATP production or force-time integral during the MVC. While ATP production by each pathway was unchanged after the first session, 6 sessions increased the relative contribution of ATPOX (from 31 \u00b1 2 to 39 \u00b1 2% of total ATP turnover, P < 0.001) and lowered the relative contribution from both ATPCK (49 \u00b1 2 to 44 \u00b1 1%, P = 0.004) and ATPGLY (20 \u00b1 2 to 17 \u00b1 1%, P = 0.03).\nContext 3: To test the hypothesis that antioxidants can attenuate high-intensity interval training-induced improvements in exercise performance.\nContext 4: Creatine (Cr) supplementation has been shown to attenuate increases in plasma ammonia and hypoxanthine during intense endurance exercise lasting 1 h, suggesting that Cr supplementation may improve muscle energy balance (matching of ATP resynthesis to ATP demand) during such exercise. We hypothesized that Cr supplementation would improve muscle energy balance (as assessed by muscle inosine monophosphate (IMP) accumulation) during intense endurance exercise.\nContext 5: Following a large myocardial infarction (MI), remaining viable muscle often undergoes pathological remodelling and progresses towards chronic heart failure. Mitochondria may also be affected by this process and, due to their functional importance, likely contribute to the progression of the disease. Aerobic interval training (AIT) has been shown effective in diminishing pathological myocardial transformation, but the effects of AIT on mitochondrial function in hearts undergoing remodelling are unknown. We hypothesized that AIT would improve mitochondrial function in hearts undergoing pathological remodelling.\nContext 6: Aerobic interval training (AIT) has been shown to improve exercise capacity and reduce mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

Incident HF occurred in 18% and 20% of matched participants with and without prediabetes, respectively (hazard ratio {HR} associated with prediabetes, 0.90; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.76-1.07; p=0.239). Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for incident HF associated with prediabetes among 4602 pre-match participants were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.40; p=0.003) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.85-1.14; p=0.826), respectively. Among matched individuals, prediabetes had no independent association with incident acute myocardial infarction (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.81-1.28; p=0.875), angina pectoris (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77-1.12; p=0.451), stroke (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-1.06; p=0.151) or all-cause mortality (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11; p=0.840).\nContext 3: In the DHS (Dallas Heart Study), a multiethnic probability-based population sample, traditional CHD risk factors and CAC were measured in participants without baseline cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Incident CHD-defined as CHD death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization-was assessed over a median follow-up of 9.2 years. Predicted CHD risk was assessed with a Weibull model inclusive of traditional risk factors before and after the addition of CAC as ln(CAC + 1). Participants were divided into 3 10-year risk categories, <6%, 6% to <20%, and \u226520%, and the net reclassification improvement (NRI) was calculated. We also performed a random-effects meta-analysis of NRI from previous studies inclusive of older adults.\nContext 4: In the DHS, 10-year CHD risk was 6% (95% CI, 5% to 7%) in the lowest CAC tertile and 20% (95% CI, 18% to 22%) in the highest CAC tertile (p<0.001). The NRI was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.79) for the lowest CAC tertile and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.22) for the highest CAC tertile (p<0.001).

CAD systems are based on the analysis of clinical and imaging data, and are used to support the diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CAD systems in rheumatology. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that evaluated the performance of CAD systems in rheumatology. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception to December 2016. We included studies that evaluated CAD systems in rheumatology and reported diagnostic performance.

Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to examine EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 and 21). Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were not identified in any of the tumors. Among these triple-negative breast cancer cases, 97 (67%) expressed one or more basal cytokeratins and 102 (71%) showed EGFR expression. Basal cytokeratin expression was detected in 65% of the tumor from the 20 BRCA1 mutation carriers and in", "Question: Do aerobic fitness variables predict the professional career of young cyclists??\nContext 1: The aim of this study was to examine the discriminant ability of aerobic fitness measures among junior cyclists of different competitive levels and to examine whether these variables were able to predict the cyclists who reached the professional level.\nContext 2: A total of 309 young cyclists (mean \u00b1 SD, age = 17.5 \u00b1 0.5 yr, height = 178 \u00b1 6 cm, weight = 66 \u00b1 7 kg) performed an incremental maximal test to determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and respiratory compensation point.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiation was administered in 152 (52.2%) patients. Perioperative blood transfusions were quantified and the potential prognostic cutoff for transfused units was calculated according to LeBlanc.\nContext 2: Perioperative transfusion of allogeneic blood has been hypothesized to have an immunomodulatory effect and influence survival in several cancer types. This study evaluates the association between receipt of leucocyte-depleted and non-depleted allogeneic blood and survival following esophagectomy for cancer.\nContext 3: Several prognostic factors for patients who have undergone esophagectomy owing to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma have been suggested, including intraoperative blood loss. There are few data, however, suggesting such an association with the prognosis following radical esophagectomy.\nContext 4: Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent radical esophagectomy were divided into two groups based on the median value of the intraoperative blood loss (510\u00a0g). A multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis was performed to determine if intraoperative blood loss could be an independent prognostic factor for long-term survival following radical esophagectomy. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test was performed between the groups.\nContext 5: From April 2005 to May 2009, a total of 37 patients underwent radical esophagectomy for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at the Juntendo Shizuoka Hospital and were assigned either to one of two groups: those with \u2265510\u00a0g blood loss [bleeding group (BG), n\u00a0=\u00a019] or of those with <510\u00a0g blood loss [less bleeding group (LBG), n\u00a0=\u00a018]. The distribution of the stage of disease, the number of positive lymph nodes, and the presence of lymphatic and vascular invasion was comparable between the groups, but the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that survival was significantly worse in the BG group than in the LBG group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.00295). This was supported by the multivariate analysis, which indicated that intraoperative blood loss was independently associated with long-term survival after radical esophagectomy.\n\nBased on the contexts, the following conclusions were drawn:\n1. The median intraoperative blood loss was 510\u00a0g in the BG group and 0\u00a0g in the LBG group. The median blood loss was significantly higher in the BG group than in the LBG group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).\n2. The median blood loss was significantly higher in the BG group than in the LBG group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).\n3. The median blood loss was significantly higher in the BG group than in the LBG group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).\n4. The median blood loss was significantly higher in the BG group than in the LBG group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).\n5", "No, stable haemodynamics is not a good prognostic factor of survival for acute type A aortic dissection repair.", "Question: Does pneumonia during the first two years of life increase risk of respiratory infections in preschool children??\nContext 1: To investigate the relationship between severe pneumonia during the first two years of life and subsequent respiratory infections in preschool children.\nContext 2: This was a cross-sectional study. We interviewed parents of children who were classified as exposed (n = 36) or non-exposed (n = 84), based on whether they were hospitalized with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia during the first two years of life. The main outcomes were physician-diagnosed respiratory infections (acute otitis media, pharyngitis, and pneumonia) and use of antibiotics during the last 2 and 12 months.\nContext 3: Prospective cohort", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Breathing 100% oxygen at the end of general anesthesia has been shown to worsen postoperative pulmonary gas exchange when an endotracheal tube is used. Counter measures, such as high positive end-expiratory pressure or the vital-capacity maneuver, may limit this effect. Such strategies, however, may be impracticable, or even contraindicated, when the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is used. Because of the vast differences in design between the LMA and endotracheal tube, we examined postanesthetic blood gas tensions in patients after emergence from anesthesia breathing oxygen via LMA. Sixty-four ASA physical status I-II patients undergoing general anesthesia for 60 min with LMA were randomly assigned to receive either 100% or 30% oxygen during emergence from anesthesia and removal of LMA. Postoperative blood gas measurements were taken at 30 and 60 min after removal of the LMA. At either measurement, patients treated with 100% oxygen essentially had the same arterial partial pressure of oxygen (60-min measurement: 83 +/- 8 versus 85 +/- 7 mm Hg [mean +/- SD], P = 0.14) as those treated with 30% oxygen. We conclude that breathing 100% oxygen at the end of general anesthesia does not worsen postoperative pulmonary gas exchange when an LMA is used.\nContext 2: Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents occurs 20 to 30% of the time during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of cardiac arrest due to loss of protective airway reflexes, pressure changes generated during CPR, and positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Although the American Heart Association has recommended the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) as an acceptable alternative airway for use by emergency medical service personnel, concerns over the capacity of the device to protect from pulmonary aspiration remain. We sought to determine the occurrence of aspiration after LMA placement, CPR, and PPV.\nContext 3: Patients were randomly assigned in physostigmine (PHYSO) and normal-saline (NS) group. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane 8% using a vital capacity breath technique, and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given to facilitate Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) No. 4 insertion. Anesthesia was maintained with end-tidal sevoflurane 1.5% and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. After extubation, patients were randomized to receive either PHYSO or NS. The primary outcome was the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents and the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration of gastric contents and aspiration", "Question: Does etanercept essentially increase the total costs of the treatment of refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis??\nYes, etanercept essentially increases the total costs of the treatment of refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\nThe total costs of the treatment of refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis increased by 2700 US dollars per patient per year. This is a significant increase in direct costs. The indirect costs were reduced by 50%, i.e., 1700 US dollars per patient per year. The total costs of the treatment of refractory juvenile idiopathic arthritis increased by 4200 US dollars per patient per year. This is a significant increase in total costs.", "Question: Is subclinical abnormal glucose tolerance a predictor of death in liver cirrhosis??\nYes, subclinical abnormal glucose tolerance is a predictor of death in liver cirrhosis.\nThe study by Karaman et al. (2010) showed that subclinical abnormal glucose tolerance (SAGT) is a predictor of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. The study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. The study included 100 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and normal fasting plasma glucose. Fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels were measured, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. According to OGTT results two groups of patients were formed: those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)", "Contexts:\nContext 1: K/BxN serum transfer induced pronounced arthritis with similar incidence and severity in IL-33 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, disease development was significantly reduced in ST2 KO mice. IL-33 expression in synovial tissue was comparable in arthritic WT and ST2 KO mice, and absent in IL-33 KO mice. Transfer of purified arthritogenic IgG instead of complete K/BxN serum also resulted in similar arthritis severity in IL-33 KO and WT mice, excluding a contribution of IL-33 contained in the serum of donor mice to explain this result. We investigated additional potential confounding factors, including purity of genetic background, but the mechanisms underlying reduced arthritis in ST2 KO mice remained unclear.\nContext 2: Interleukin (IL)-33 is a cytokine of the IL-1 family, which signals through the ST2 receptor. Previous work suggested implication of the IL-33/ST2 axis in the pathogenesis of human and mouse arthritis. Here, we directly investigated the role of endogenous IL-33 in K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis by using IL-33 knockout (KO) mice.\nContext 3: IL-36R, IL-36Ra and IL-36\u03b3 mRNA were detected in the joints of mice with CIA, but their levels did not correlate with arthritis severity. As opposed to anti-IL-1RI antibody treatment, the injection of an anti-IL-36R antibody was devoid of effect on the development and severity of CIA. The severity of joint inflammation and structural damage in AIA was also unaltered by anti-IL-36R antibody treatment. Finally, the severity of AIA and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis was similar in IL-36R-deficient and wild-type mice.\nContext 4: Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis were induced according to standard protocols. Messenger RNA levels for IL-36R and its ligands in the joints of mice with CIA were determined by RT-qPCR. Mice with CIA were injected with a blocking monoclonal anti-IL-36R, a blocking anti-IL-1RI, or their isotype-matched control antibodies at the time of arthritis onset. Anti-IL-36R or control antibodies were also injected at the time of AIA induction. Finally, IL-36R-deficient mice were examined in the context of K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis.\nContext 5: IL-36R-deficient mice were examined in the context of K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis. Mice were injected with K/BxN serum at the time of arthritis onset. The severity of arthritis was assessed by measuring the number of swollen joints and the severity of joint inflammation. The severity of joint inflammation and structural damage in AIA was also unaltered by anti-IL-36R antibody treatment. Finally, the severity of AIA and K/BxN serum transfer-induced arthritis was similar in IL-36R-deficient and wild-type mice.\nContext 6: The severity of arthritis was assessed by measuring the number of swollen joints and the", "Question: Do in vitro tests indicate that certain varieties of oats may be harmful to patients with coeliac disease??\nThe aim of this work is to evaluate if different varieties of oats exert different toxicity in coeliac disease.\nThe necessity of excluding oats from the diet has remained controversial. We studied the toxicity of oats in children with coeliac disease during a 2-year follow-up by investigating jejunal transglutaminase 2 (TG2)-targeted IgA-class autoantibody deposits, a potentially more sensitive disease marker than serum antibodies or conventional histology.\nThree varieties of oats were tested by two in vitro assay based on the known ability of peptic-tryptic digests of coeliac-active proteins to agglutinate", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support in Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) patients with a predicted mortality of 100%, and the complications associated with this treatment modality and different cannulation techniques.\nContext 2: The severity of respiratory failure at the time of HFOV intervention was comparable in both early and late groups (PaCO2/FiO2 83 vs. 79 torr, oxygenation index 27 vs. 33, AaDO2 421 torr (56 kPa) vs. 413 torr (55 kPa)). There were no differences in mean age, weight, admission PRISM score length of HFOV, length of CMV after HFOV (CMV post-HFOV) and the total duration of mechanical ventilation between the groups. We found a statistically significant difference in mortality with 58.8% of the early intervention patients surviving while only 12.5% of the late intervention patients survived. The overall survival rate was 42% (11/26 patients).\nContext 3: To investigate whether the use of continuous renal replacement therapy is independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality in children on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nContext 4: We included 385 patients undergoing veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy following CV surgery at a university-affiliated tertiary-care center into our single-center registry. Thirty patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) followed by immediate initiation of ECMO support. During a median follow-up time of 44 months (IQR 21-76 months), 68% of patients (n=262) died. We did not detect a significant impact of CPR during ECMO initiation on 30-day mortality (HR 1.04, 95%CI 0.89-1.83, P=0.86) as well as for long-term mortality (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.63-1.61, P=0.97). Results were virtually unchanged for 30-day (HR 0.88, 95%CI 0.44-1.73, P=0.70) and long-term mortality (HR 0.93, 95%CI 0.54-1.60, P=0.79) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support in Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) patients with a predicted mortality of 100%, and the complications associated with this treatment modality and different cannulation techniques.\nContext 6: The severity of respiratory failure at the time of HFOV intervention was comparable in both early and late groups (PaCO2/FiO2 83 vs. 79 torr, oxygenation index 27 vs. 33, AaDO2 421 torr (56 kPa) vs. 413 torr (55 kPa)). There", "Contexts:\nContext 1: It has been hypothesized that an increased incidence of fever in patients receiving epidural analgesia might result not from epidural per se, but rather from the antipyretic effect of opioids preferentially administered to women in the no-epidural group. If this were the case, then one would expect the incidence of fever in parturients who did not receive systemic opioids to be independent of whether they received epidural analgesia.\nContext 2: The incidence of fever did not differ according to nalbuphine administration for women not receiving epidural analgesia (1% no nalbuphine, 0.3% with nalbuphine, P = 0.27) or for women receiving epidural analgesia (17% no nalbuphine, 17% with nalbuphine, P = 1.0). However, the incidence of fever differed significantly between patients who received no analgesia as compared to those who received epidural analgesia alone (1% vs. 17%, P = 10(-6)). Controlling for confounding did not alter these associations.\nContext 3: In the epidural group we found a consistent decrease in IAP from 16.82 +/- 4.56 to 6.30 +/- 3.11 mmHg and an increase in APP from 60.26 +/- 21.893 to 76.10 +/- 17.54 mmHg between baseline values until the second day of epidural analgesia, which remained stable afterwards. There were no significant differences of IAP and APP in the opioid group.\nContext 4: Using a cohort study design, the authors evaluated the records of 1,233 nulliparous patients whose labor analgesia was managed with (1) no medication (N = 170); (2) 10 mg intravenous systemic nalbuphine plus 10 mg intramuscular every 3 to 4 h as required (N = 327); (3) epidural analgesia with continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with 2 microg/ml fentanyl (N = 278); or (4) patients who received both systemic nalbuphine and epidural analgesia (N = 458). Fever was diagnosed if the maximum temperature during labor exceeded 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C).\nContext 5: The incidence of fever was 1.3% in the no nalbuphine group, 0.3% in the nalbuphine group, 0.3% in the epidural group, and 0.3% in the combined group (P = 0.27). The incidence of fever was 17% in the no nalbuphine group, 17% in the nalbuphine group, 17% in the epidural group, and 17% in the combined group (P = 1.0).

It is unknown whether the impact of serum bilirubin on carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, is different in diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic subjects. We assessed relationships of IMT with serum total bilirubin in non-diabetic and Type 2 diabetic subjects without clinically manifest cardiovascular disease.\nContext 2: The intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, as determined by ultrasonography, is useful for reflecting the extent of subclinical atherosclerosis. We investigated the relationship between IMT and the serum concentrations of small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in diabetic patients.\nContext 3: In the entire diabetes cohort, no differences were observed in carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) or plaque prevalence between the genotype groups. However, among those with established diabetes, Hp2-2 was associated with higher plaque prevalence and larger carotid IMT compared with the Hp2-1 and Hp1-1 genotypes. Common cardiovascular risk factors did not differ between the genotype groups.\nContext 4: IMT was higher in diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic subjects (unadjusted, p<0.001), whereas bilirubin was not different (p=0.82). In both non-diabetic and in diabetic subjects, IMT was negatively related to bilirubin (\u03b2=-0.316, p=0.045 and \u03b2=-0.247 p=0.014, respectively) taking account of age, sex and mean arterial pressure. In the combined subjects, IMT remained independently related to bilirubin (\u03b2=-0.183, p=0.028) after additional adjustment for diabetes status, alcohol intake, transaminases, CRP and lipid levels. There was no interaction of bilirubin with the presence of diabetes on IMT (p=0.98).\nContext 5: A total of 68 normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and the following parameters were assessed: urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary \u03b1(1)-microglobulin, urinary \u03b2(2)-microglobulin, plasma asymmetric dimethyl-arginine (ADMA), serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, and serum bilirubin. The mean age of the patients was 58.5\u00b110.2 years, and 52.9% were women. The mean UACR was 1.2\u00b10.9 mg/gCr, and the mean urinary \u03b1(1)-microglobulin was 0.8\u00b10.5 mg/gCr. The mean urinary \u03b2(2)-microglobulin was 0.3\u00b10.2 mg/gCr. The mean serum creatinine was 0.9\u00b1", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Trauma patients sustaining abdominal trauma exhibit high risk of organ failure and/or sepsis aggravating morbidity and mortality during the post-traumatic course. The present study re-evaluates L- and I-FABPs (small fatty acid binding proteins) as early biomarkers for abdominal injury (AI) in a large cohort of patients and analyzes their potential as indicators of specific organ failure and their association with sepsis and/or mortality in the post-traumatic course.\nContext 2: Median L- and I-FABP in the AI-group [258 (IQR=71-500) ng/mL and 328 (IQR=148-640) pg/mL, respectively] were higher compared to noAI-group [30 (IQR=18-50) ng/mL and 60 (IQR=40-202) pg/mL, p>0.05] on d0. Sensitivity and specificity to detect AI were 80% and 75% for L-FABP, 78% and 62% for I-FABP. Both FABPs decline with the post-traumatic course to control levels. On d0 and d1, FABPs correlate with the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of the following day (d0: \u03c1:0.33, \u03c1:0.46, d1: \u03c1:0.48, \u03c1:0.35). No other correlations were found. Eight percent of all patients developed sepsis, 18% pneumonia, 4% urinary tract infection, 3% acute kidney failure and one MOF. FABPs correlated neither with Simplifed Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II nor to sepsis. All patients with acute kidney failure demonstrated enhanced L-FAPB levels before the increase of serum creatinine levels.\nContext 3: This prospective study included 134 multiply traumatized patients (ISS\u226516). Fifty-nine had AI (abbreviated AI Scale, AISAbd\u22653) and 75 had no AI (noAI). Twenty healthy volunteers served as controls. Plasma I- and L-FABP levels were measured at the admittance to the emergency room (d0) and up to 10 days daily (d1-d10) using ELISA.

We measured ATP and acetylcholine content in the rat urinary bladder under saline or H(2)O(2) stimulation. Hyaluronic acid, muscarinic, and purinergic receptor antagonists were used to evaluate their effects and mechanisms on H(2)O(2)-induced hyperactive bladder.\nContext 2: We hypothesize that increased H(2)O(2) in the urinary bladder may affect ATP and acetylcholine release and activate urothelial purinergic and muscarinic signaling consequently leading to hyperactive bladder.\nContext 3: Intravesical H(2)O(2) administration increased the frequency of voiding and the maximal amplitude of intravesical pressure (IVP) in the urethane anesthetized rats. Intravesical H(2)O(2) decreased the threshold level of PANA and PENA for triggering micturition and increased ATP and acetylcholine contents in the H(2)O(2)-treated bladder in the rat. Hyaluronic acid in vitro directly scavenged H(2)O(2) in a dose-dependent manner. Intravesical hyaluronic acid for 30 min attenuated H(2)O(2)-elicited excitatory effects on the frequency of voiding, amplitude of IVP and the sensitization of PANA and PENA in the rats. Hyaluronic acid treatment reduced H(2)O(2)-induced ATP and acetylcholine release in the urinary bladder.

Extensive studies conducted over the last few years have allowed the definition of the 'classical form' of Omenn syndrome due to hypomorphic defects in genes involved in V(D)J recombination, mainly RAG genes, and 'Omenn-like' features associated with mutations in genes involved in the maturation steps of lymphoid cells other than V(D)J recombination. Moreover, an increasing number of diseases other than those due to V(D)J recombination defects develop Omenn signs.\nContext 2: During the past decade, easy access to sequence analyses has allowed us to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of severe combined immunodeficiencies. Here, we describe the expanding clinical and immunological spectrum associated with Omenn syndrome phenotype. In particular, we review the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of 'classical' Omenn syndrome due to the recombination activating gene (RAG) defects and of a new subgroup of Omenn-like disorders.\nContext 3: The presence of T cells in patients with Omenn syndrome (OS) and patients with atypical presentations of severe combined immunodeficiency gene mutations presents an opportunity to study the effects of the causal genes on TCR repertoires and provides a window into the clinical heterogeneity observed.\nContext 4: Neither the donor nor the recipient GvHD risk alleles TNFd3/d3 and IL-10(-1064) (11-16) were associated with the development of aGvHD grades II to IV and I to IV. Because of the heterogeneity of CBTs, the data were reanalyzed separately for patients with malignancies (n=83) or with inborn errors (n=24). No significant association was observed between the severity of aGvHD and the possession of either TNFd3/d3 or IL-10 (11-16) genotypes. Mismatches for the mHags HY, HA-1, and CD31 exon 125 between donor and recipient did not associate with aGvHD grades II to IV.\nContext 5: Human prion protein gene (PRNP) is considered a critical and fundamental gene in determining the incidence of human prion diseases. Codons 129 and 219 play an important role in the susceptibility to sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and the development of variant CJD (vCJD). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the codon 129 and 219 polymorphisms and the risk of developing sCJD and vCJD. The codon 129 and 219 polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,000 patients with sCJD and 1,000 patients with vCJD.

The femoral nerve block (FNB) has been traditionally employed. Ultrasound application to regional nerve blocks allows for the use of alternatives such as the saphenous nerve block following ACL reconstruction.\nContext 3: To test the hypothesis that the addition of a preincisional femoral 3-in-1 block to intra-articular instillation with ropivacaine 0.2% at the end of surgery improves postoperative pain control in patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) under general anesthesia.\nContext 4: Forty patients scheduled to undergo knee surgery (anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction) were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive PSNB alone (control group, n = 20) or PSNB in combination with an obturator nerve block (obturator group, n = 20). After evaluation for 30 min, the two groups received a femoral nerve block, and patients were taken to surgery. The obturator nerve blockade was assessed by measurement of adductor strength at baseline (T0) and every 10 min during the 30-min evaluation (T10, T20, and T30). Pain scores after tourniquet inflation and during surgery were compared between the two groups. The requirement for additional intravenous analgesia and/or sedation was also recorded.\nContext 5: Both neuraxial and peripheral regional analgesic techniques offer postoperative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients. While no single technique is preferred, quadriceps muscle weakness from peripheral nerve blocks may impede rehabilitation. We designed this study to compare postoperative ambulation outcome in THA patients who were treated with a new ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca catheter (FIC) technique or intrathecal morphine (ITM).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does postoperative Analgesia with Saphenous Nerve Block (SSNB) provide better postoperative analgesia than Femoral Nerve Block (FNB) for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon (bone-tendon-bone (BTB)) autografts?\n\n## Context 1:\nThis study evaluated postoperative analgesia provided by the subsartorial saphenous nerve block (SSNB) compared to that provided by the traditional FNB for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon (bone-tendon-bone (BTB)) autografts.\nContext 2: Adequate pain control following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL) often requires regional nerve block.

The objective of this study was to examine predictors of transfer to acute care in the inpatient burn rehabilitation population.\nContext 2: Data are obtained from Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation from 2002 to 2010 for patients with a primary diagnosis of burn injury. Predictor variables include demographic, medical, and facility data. Descriptive statistics are calculated for acute and nonacute transfer patients. Logistic regression analysis is used to determine significant predictors of acute transfer within the first 3 days. A scoring system is developed to determine the risk", "Contexts:\nContext 1: FoxM1 protein and mRNA levels were elevated in pancreatic carcinoma lesions compared with the paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. A high level of expression of FoxM1 was significantly correlated with clinical staging (P = 0.004), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009), and histological differentiation (P = 0.017). Patients with a higher FoxM1 expression had a significantly shorter survival time than those patients with lower FoxM1 expression (P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed that FoxM1 could serve as an independent factor of poor prognosis.\nContext 2: Oncogenic transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FoxM1)-related clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) have not been identified. Our aim of studying FoxM1 expression level and survival rate of PDA is to determine whether FoxM1 is a valuable prognostic predictor for PDA patients.\nContext 3: Expressional levels of FoxM1 mRNA and protein in paired pancreatic cancer lesions and adjacent noncancerous tissues were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. FoxM1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 80 patients with PDA. The correlations between FoxM1 immunostaining levels and clinicopathologic factors, as well as the follow-up data of patients, were analyzed statistically.\nContext 4: The effect of altered expression of FOXM1 on expression of glycolytic enzymes and tumor development and progression was examined using animal models of pancreatic cancer. Also, the underlying mechanisms of altered pancreatic cancer glycolysis were analyzed using in vitro molecular biology. The clinical relevance of aberrant metabolism caused by dysregulated FOXM1 signaling was determined using pancreatic tumor and normal pancreatic tissue specimens.\nContext 5: We found that FOXM1 did not markedly change the expression of most glycolytic enzymes except for phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK-1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). FOXM1 and LDHA were overexpressed concomitantly in pancreatic tumors and cancer cell lines. Increased expression of FOXM1 upregulated the expression of LDHA at both the mRNA and protein level and elevated LDH activity, lactate production, and glucose utilization, whereas reduced expression of FOXM1 did the opposite. Further studies demonstrated that FOXM1 bound directly to the LDHA promoter region and regulated the expression of LDHA. FOXM1 also increased the expression of glycolytic enzymes in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, FOXM1 overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells increased the glycolytic flux and glucose uptake, and decreased the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT4. These results suggest that FOXM1 is a key regulator of glycolysis in pancreatic cancer cells.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of FOXM1 in pancreatic cancer and its clinical significance. The expression of FOXM1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 80 patients with pancreatic cancer. The correlation between FOXM1 expression and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. The expression of FOXM", "Question: Does blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area reduce heroin reinforcement in rat??\nYes, blockade of ionotropic glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area reduces heroin reinforcement in rat.\nThe present study sought to assess whether blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) would modulate heroin self-administration (SA) behavior in rats.\nThe effects of systemic or regional administration of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists into the VTA on the maintenance of heroin SA were assessed. Rats were reinforced each time they responded on a lever with a single injection of intravenous heroin. To determine the specificity of their effects on heroin SA", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Intraventricular hemorrhage is a severe subtype of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with high mortality and poor outcome.\nContext 2: This study investigated the effect of preexisting antiplatelet therapy on mortality and functional outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\nContext 3: After excluding lost-to-follow-up patients, 967 intracerebral hemorrhage patients were included, out of whom 398 (41%) had intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage patients, compared with nonintraventricular hemorrhage patients, had lower baseline Glasgow Coma Scale [median 12 (IQR 6-15) vs. 15 (13-15); P\u2009<\u20090.001] and higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [18 (10-27) vs. 7 (3-14); P\u2009<\u20090.001] scores; larger intracerebral hemorrhage volumes [17\u2009ml (7.2-42) vs. 6.8 (2.4-18); P\u2009<\u20090.001] and more often hydrocephalus (51% vs. 9%; P\u2009<\u20090.001); and higher mortality rates (54% vs. 18%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). In multivariable analysis, the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage was independently associated with mortality [OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.36-3.09)] when adjusted for well-known prognostic factors of intracerebral hemorrhage, i.e. age, gender, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, intracerebral hemorrhage volume, infratentorial location, and etiology.\nContext 4: The development of intracerebral hemorrhage following intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) can be influenced by various confounders related to the underlying vessel and tissue conditions. There are some data on association of cause of the stroke and the hemorrhage transformation. We tested the hypothesis that the cause of stroke is associated with the development of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) following IVT.\nContext 5: To determine whether mortality rate after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is lower in patients admitted to a neurologic or neurosurgical (neuro) intensive care unit (ICU) compared to those admitted to general ICUs.\n\nBased on the contexts above, the following questions were addressed:\n1. What is the association between the cause of the stroke and the development of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) following intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)?\n2. What is the association between the cause of the stroke and mortality rate after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)?\n3. What is the association between the cause of the stroke and mortality rate after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in patients admitted to a neurologic or neurosurgical (neuro) intensive care unit (ICU)?\n4.

Both excitotoxicity and oxidative stress have been proposed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of HD. Since no effective treatment is available, this study was designed to explore the therapeutic potential of erythropoietin (EPO), a cytokine that has been found to prevent excitotoxicity, and to promote neurogenesis. To avoid the side effects of a raised hematocrit, we used asialoerythropoietin (asialoEPO), a neuroprotective variant of EPO that lacks erythropoietic effects in mice. R6/2 transgenic HD mice were treated with this cytokine from five to twelve weeks of age.\nContext 2: TP53 is an attractive candidate for modifying age of onset (AO) in Huntington disease (HD): The amino-terminus of the mutated huntingtin (htt) exon 1 translation product has functional properties which may affect critically the TP53 pathway in HD neurons. The pathogenic domain of mutant htt interacts with nuclear transcription factors, and it potentially modulates TP53-induced transcriptional events. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resulting in the R72P exchange in TP53 protein might modulate the variation in AO. In addition, also the R196K replacement in human caspase activated DNase (hCAD) may theoretically affect the AO.\nContext 3: The YAC128 model of Huntington's disease (HD) shows substantial deficits in motor, learning and memory tasks and alterations in its transcriptional profile. We examined the changes in the transcriptional profile in the YAC128 mouse model of HD at 6, 12 and 18\u00a0months and compared these with those seen in other models and human HD caudate.\nContext 4: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fully penetrant, autosomal dominantly inherited disorder associated with abnormal expansions of a stretch of perfect CAG repeats in the 5' part of the IT15 gene. The number of repeat units is highly predictive for the age at onset (AO) of the disorder. But AO is only modestly correlated with repeat length when intermediate HD expansions are considered. Circumstantial evidence suggests that additional features of the HD course are based on genetic traits. Therefore, it may be possible to investigate the genetic background of HD, i.e. to map the loci underlying the genetic variation in the number of CAG repeats. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants in the HD gene that are associated with the number of CAG repeats in the HD gene.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the human huntingtin gene (HTT) on the expression of the HTT protein in the human brain. The 5'UTR of the HTT gene is a region of high complexity and contains several transcription factor binding sites. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the 5'UTR of the HTT gene on the expression of the HTT protein in the human brain.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Duplex surveillance of lower extremity reversed vein bypass grafts (LERVG) is a means of identifying patients at risk for occlusion. The perceived accuracy of duplex scan as a means of identifying stenoses has led many surgeons to perform graft revision on the basis of duplex scan alone. This may result in missing additional lesions that are threatening patency. To assess the role of duplex scan as the sole imaging method before revision of LERVGs, we reviewed consecutive patients undergoing revisions who underwent preoperative arteriography after identification of duplex scan abnormalities.\nContext 2: Modifiable patient factors that contribute to graft occlusion may be addressed after surgery. To determine risk factors associated with reverse vein graft (RVG) occlusion, we examined the characteristics and duplex scan surveillance (DS) patterns of patients with RVGs.\nContext 3: The aim of this study was to determine whether predischarge duplex imaging of an infrainguinal vein graft could predict the subsequent development of graft stenosis.\nContext 4: Patients with infrainguinal vein grafts underwent a duplex scan of the entire graft before discharge from hospital. Grafts were classified as abnormal or normal based on the presence or absence of flow abnormalities (peak velocity ratio 1.5 or greater). All grafts were re-examined 1 month after surgery, at 3-monthly intervals for the first year and then every 6 months thereafter. A significant stenosis requiring correction was defined by a duplex-derived peak systolic velocity ratio of 3.0 or more. The relationship between the predischarge scan and subsequent development of stenosis was examined.\nContext 5: Two hundred five LERVG revisions were performed. The 5-year assisted primary patency rate was 91%. In 119 cases (58%), arteriography did not contribute significantly to duplex scan findings. Arteriography significantly contributed to operative planning in 86 cases (42%). In 38 cases (19%), only a low-flow state was identified by means of duplex scan, and a correctable stenosis was identified by means of arteriography. In 48 cases (23%), additional significant lesions corrected at operation were identified by means of arteriography. These included 26 inflow, 16 graft, and 8 outflow lesions. Arteriography was most useful as a means of determining the revision procedure performed when there were inflow lesions (P <.05) or when the proximal anastomosis was to be revised (P <.05). In 10 cases (5%), the duplex scan was normal, and the graft was found to be normal on arteriography. In 5 cases (3%), the duplex scan was abnormal, and the graft was found to be abnormal on arteriography. In 2 cases (1%), the duplex scan was normal, and the graft was found to be normal on arteriography. In 2 cases (1%), the duplex scan was abnormal, and the graft was found to be abnormal on arteriography. In 2 cases (1%), the duplex scan was abnormal, and the graft was found to be abnormal on arteriography. In 2 cases (1%), the duplex scan was abnormal", "Question: Do outcome study of the psychological changes after silicone breast implant removal??\nExplanation: The study examines the relationship between the physical symptoms, pre-operative psychological distress and outcome following surgery. The study found that psychological distress was associated with poorer physical health outcomes after breast implant removal. The study also found that women who had breast reconstruction after implant removal had higher psychological distress than women who did not have reconstruction. The study found that women who had psychiatric treatment before breast implant removal had the greatest increase in psychological distress. The study found that women who had implants removed had better physical health outcomes than those who did not have implants removed. The study found that women who had implants removed had better psychological outcomes than those who did not have implants removed.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) including sheep scrapie are characterized by the conversion of a normal, cellular prion protein (PrPc) to an abnormal protease-resistant form (PrPSc). Like human peripheral blood, the peripheral blood of scrapie-infected sheep remains one possible source of disease transmission. As a first step in understanding the disease requirements in the natural scrapie", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is perceived to be rare in Asia, but our recent clinical experience at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) suggests otherwise. Between 1996 and 1997, there were 388 cases of confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\nContext 2: Within the cohort of eligibles with myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 5,673) there were 212 incident cases of deep vein thrombosis events. Mean age was 76.2 (standard deviation = \u00b1 8.6) years. Use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents was not associated with deep vein thrombosis in the crude nor the adjusted models (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.60, 2.43). Central venous catheter placement (OR = 6.47, 95% CI: 2.37, 17.62) and red blood cell transfusion (OR = 4.60, 95% CI: 2.29, 9.23) were associated with deep vein thrombosis.\nContext 3: Forty-eight patients with deep vein thrombosis and 45 control subjects were included. Venous blood samples were obtained at diagnosis for analysis of TF activity, TF antigen, prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, microparticles (expressing phosphatidylserine and supporting FXa generation), Interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF).\nContext 4: Evident loss in combined group was 535.55 mL, not significantly less than IV (585 mL, P =.15) and intraarticular group (514 mL, P =.74). However, these were significantly less than control group (696 mL, P =.000). Functional scores and recovery rates were, however, comparable in all 4 groups. No patients in any group developed symptomatic deep vein thrombosis.\nContext 5: The cumulative incidence of deep venous thrombosis up to one year after surgery was 20 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 31 percent) in the positive D-dimer group compared with 5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 12 percent) in the negative D-dimer group. The cumulative incidence of deep venous thrombosis was 20 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 31 percent) in the positive D-dimer group compared with 5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 12 percent) in the negative D-dimer group.\nContext 6: The incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 0.5 percent in the positive D-dimer group compared with 0.1 percent in the negative D-dimer group.

In hospital mortality (HMO group, 1.9%; FFS group, 2.2%), mean ICU stay (HMO, 2.6 +/- 0.3 days; FFS, 2.3 +/- 0.3 days), and total hospital length of stay (HMO, 9.8 +/- 0.8 days; FFS, 8.6 +/- 0.6 days) were likewise similar.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) increase the risk of death or myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)?\nContext 1: This retrospective propensity-matched study investigated the impact of prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on short-term and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\nContext 2: To investigate whether common risk stratification models in cardiac surgery predict perioperative outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with previous percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs).\nContext 3: We sought to test the hypothesis that the transradial approach is associated with lower risk of adverse outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)", "Contexts:\nContext 1: During a mean follow-up of 6.2 years (SD, 2.0), 158 participants developed dementia (107 developed Alzheimer disease). The incidence rate of dementia was 13.0 per 1000 person-years for participants who exercised 3 or more times per week compared with 19.7 per 1000 person-years for those who exercised fewer than 3 times per week. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of dementia was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.86; P = 0.004). The interaction between exercise and performance-based physical function was statistically significant (P = 0.013). The risk reduction associated with exercise was greater in those with lower performance levels. Similar results were observed in analyses restricted to participants with incident Alzheimer disease.\nContext 2: The prevalence of dementia was 10% after a mean follow-up of 28\u00a0years. Risk score was a good predictor of dementia: area under the curve\u00a0=\u00a00.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.80). The risk of dementia decreased as a function of risk score from 36% to 0%. The risk score was significantly associated with cognition after a mean follow-up of 39\u00a0years in the replication sample.\nContext 3: To compare survival and rates of cognitive and functional decline in patients with autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in a large multicenter study.\nContext 4: This prospective cohort study included 287 community-dwelling memory clinic patients with dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment. The Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Delirium Index, and Nottingham Instrumental Activities of Daily Living tests were administered to each subject.\nContext 5: Among 557 dementia cases, 24 (4.3%) had undergone a CABG prior to the onset of dementia with a median lag time of 5.5 years (range = 0.1 to 15.9). Among 557 controls, 28 subjects (5.0%) had undergone a CABG prior to the index year with a median lag time 3.9 years (range = 0.1 to 12.3); OR = 0.85 (95% CI = 0.49 to 1.49; p = 0.57) for dementia cases vs controls.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the presence of aortic calcification and cognitive decline in a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the presence of aortic calcification and cognitive decline in a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the presence of aortic calcification and cognitive decline in a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the presence of aortic calcification and cognitive decline in a large cohort of community-dwelling", "Contexts:\nContext 1: During stand/tilt tests after spaceflight, 20% of astronauts experience orthostatic hypotension and presyncope. Spaceflight-induced hypovolemia is a contributing factor. Fludrocortisone, a synthetic mineralocorticoid, has been shown to increase plasma volume and orthostatic tolerance in Earth-bound patients. The efficacy of fludrocortisone as a treatment for postflight hypovolemia and orthostatic hypotension in astronauts has not been studied. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that astronauts who ingest fludrocortisone prior to landing would have less loss of plasma volume and greater orthostatic tolerance than astronauts who do not ingest fludrocortisone.\nContext 2: There were 25 male astronauts who were randomized into 2 groups: placebo (n = 18) and fludrocortisone (n = 7), and participated in stand tests 10 d before launch and 2-4 h after landing. Subjects took either 0.3 mg fludrocortisone or placebo orally 7 h prior to landing. Supine plasma and red cell volumes, supine and standing HR, arterial pressure, aortic outflow, and plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were measured.\nContext 3: On landing day, 2 of 18 in the placebo group and 1 of 7 in the fludrocortisone group became presyncopal (chi2 = 0.015, p = 0.90). Plasma volumes were significantly decreased after flight in the placebo group, but not in the fludrocortisone group. During postflight stand tests, standing plasma norepinephrine was significantly less in the fludrocortisone group compared with the placebo group.\nContext 4: Based on data from astronauts who have flown in space, there is no compelling experimental evidence to support significant occurrence of cardiac dysrhythmias, manifestation of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, or reduction in myocardial contractile function. Although there are post-spaceflight data that demonstrate lower peripheral resistance in astronauts who become presyncopal compared with non-presyncopal astronauts, it is not clear that these differences are the result of decreased vascular function. However, the evidence of postflight orthostatic intolerance and reduced exercise capacity is well substantiated by both spaceflight and ground experiments. Although attenuation of baroreflex function(s) may contribute to postflight orthostatic intolerance, the mechanism(s) of the postflight decrease in exercise capacity is not clear. The results of this study suggest that fludrocortisone may attenuate postflight orthostatic intolerance and exercise intolerance in astronauts.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that fludrocortisone may attenuate postflight orthostatic intolerance and exercise intolerance in astronauts.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Microarray analyses have revealed significantly elevated expression of the proto-oncogene ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase in 20-30% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). Selective and potent ROS1 kinase inhibitors have recently been developed and oncogenic rearrangement of ROS1 in NSCLC identified.\nContext 2: Overall expression rate of ROS1 was 22% (19% for adenocarcinomas and 25% for nonadenocarcinomas) in NSCLC. ROS1 expression was a worse prognostic factor for overall survival in adenocarcinomas of stage I NSCLC. In recurred NSCLC, ROS1 expression was significantly higher in recurring tumors (38%) than primary tumors (19%). Two NSCLC cell lines showed increased ROS1 expression after treatment with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine and/or trichostatin A. Among the 14 adenocarcinomas examined, two (14%) showed more than twice the level of ROS1 expression in tumor tissue than was observed in matched normal tissue and statistically significant differences in the ROS1 promoter methylation level.\nContext 3: We performed immunohistochemical evaluation of expression of ROS1 kinase and its downstream molecules in 399 NSCLC cases. ROS1 expression in primary and recurring lesions of 92 recurrent NSCLC cases was additionally analyzed. To elucidate mechanism of expression, two ROS1-nonexpressing NSCLC cell lines (Calu6 and H358) and fresh frozen tissues from 28 consecutive NSCLC patients were examined for ROS1 promoter methylation status and ROS1 expression.\nContext 4: The presence of mutation in EGFR gene is known as a predictive marker for the response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. However, whether or not these EGFR mutations are prognostic factors for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is debatable.\nContext 5: Different studies have demonstrated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status as an independent prognostic factor for ovarian cancer (OC). Recent studies in non-small cell lung cancer suggest that the presence of a clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors correlates with somatic mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR, exons 18-21. For patients with OC, data are not available on EGFR gene mutation.\n\nBased on the contexts above, we hypothesized that EGFR mutation status may be a prognostic factor for NSCLC. We also hypothesized that EGFR mutation status may be a predictive factor for response to EGFR TKI treatment.\n\n## Methods\n### Study population\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 399 patients with NSCLC who were treated at the National Cancer Center Hospital East between 2000 and 2010.

Recipients of HRD grafts were significantly older and heavier than those who received an SRD graft (8.5 vs 6.5 years, p < 0.001 and 35.7 vs 26.9 kg, p < 0.001). There was no difference in patient survival (log rank, p = 0.88) between groups. There was no difference in rejection prior to discharge (17.2 vs 16.4%, p = 0.81) or length of stay after transplantation (26.1 vs 27.6 days, p = 0.58).\nContext 2: All RIB 5/2-treated recipients survived the first observation period independent of the cold ischemia time. Graft function, morphology, and transferred T-cell numbers were comparable in both groups. Twenty days after transfer amounts of intragraft and peripheral donor-derived cells were significantly reduced in recipients of the initially prolonged cold ischemia group associated with an attenuated immune response.\nContext 3: The medical records of 363 infants and children, aged 1 day to 17 years, transplanted at Loma Linda University between November 1985 and March 2001, were retrospectively reviewed. Fourteen children received organs with prolonged ischemic times (>8 hours)(PIT) compared with 14 with short ischemic times (< or =90 minutes)(SIT). There were no significant differences when comparing donors for gender, age, weight, cause of death, or duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Preoperative donor shortening fraction (%), as determined by echocardiography, was significantly higher in the SIT group (44.5 versus 36.5%; P=0.006). There were no significant differences between PIT and SIT recipients when comparing age at transplant, weight at transplant, waiting time, weight mismatch, postoperative days on ventilator, duration of inotropic support, and hospital stay. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was significantly longer in the PIT group (140.5 versus 80.5 minute; P=0.001). Median length of follow-up for both groups was approximately 5 years. Five grafts were lost in the PIT group; 7 were lost in the SIT group, with 1 early graft loss in the SIT group and 4 late graft losses in the PIT group. The 5-year graft survival rate was 100% in both groups. The 5-year patient survival rate was 100% in both groups. The 5-year graft survival rate was 100% in both groups. The 5-year patient survival rate was 100% in both groups. The 5-year patient survival rate was 100% in both groups. The 5-year patient survival rate was 100% in both groups.

(2) LD improvement is associated with normalization of serum lipids, an increase in serum DHEA leading to normalization in cortisol:DHEA ratio, and normalization of IFN-alpha levels. (3) In LD-positive men evolution of VLDL cholesterol is negatively correlated with DHEA (r = -0.56, P < 0.01) and positively with cortisol:DHEA ratio (r = 0.62, P < 0.004) and with IFN-alpha (r = 0.57, P < 0.01). (4) The switch to LD is associated with a decrease in serum DHEA. (5) Patients who remained LD-negative maintained normal lipids, elevated cortisol and DHEA, and normal cortisol:DHEA ratio and normal levels of IFN-alpha.\nContext 3: To assess the correlations between the hormone leptin and lipoatrophy in HIV-positive, treatment-naive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).\nContext 4: Thirty-four HIV-1-positive men were followed during 32.5 +/- 4.0 months and tested at four time-points. The patients were subdivided into five groups according to physical changes and anthropometric measurements: LD-negative, initially LD-negative becoming LD-positive, LD-positive unchanged, aggravated or improved. Serum lipids, apolipoproteins, adrenal steroids and cytokines were measured and compared with baseline values.\nContext 5: Of 51 patients enrolled, 29 (56.9%) were female (median age 32 years, range 18-62). Of 43 patients HIV-tested, 38 (88.3%) were HIV-positive and 15.7% died within the first month. At 3 months, 11 (21.6%) were known to have died. Adequate cortisol levels were found in 49/51 (95.9%) before commencing RMP. Neither of the two with reduced response died. All 34 patients revealed adequate cortisol levels at 3 months. The LD-positive patients had significantly higher levels of serum DHEA (P < 0.01) and lower levels of serum cortisol (P < 0.01) than the LD-negative patients. The LD-positive patients had significantly higher levels of serum DHEA (P < 0.01) and lower levels of serum cortisol (P < 0.01) than the LD-negative patients. The LD-positive patients had significantly higher levels of serum DHEA (P < 0.01) and lower levels of serum cortisol (P < 0.01) than the LD-negative patients.

Objective and subjective tests were done before and 45 min and 90 min after intake. Ranked delta values (changes from baseline) were analysed by one-way contrast ANOVA and Scheffe's tests. In daytime study II, four healthy subjects took zolpidem 10 mg alone, and together with blinded caffeine 250 mg or (at -45 min) erythromycin 750 mg. Objective and subjective effects were measured and plasma zolpidem concentrations assayed at baseline and 45 min and 90 min after zolpidem intake.\nContext 2: In study I, practice effects after placebo (ad + 30%) were seen for letter cancellation and digit symbol substitution but not for flicker fusion tests. Zolpidem alone significantly impaired (P < 0.05 vs delta placebo) letter cancellation and digit symbol substitution at 45 min and 90 min, lowered the flicker fusion threshold at 45 min, and caused subjective drowsiness, mental slowness, clumsiness and feeling of poor performance. Caffeine alone showed a non-significant trend to improve objective performance. The combined effects of zolpidem and either dose of caffeine matched those measured after zolpidem alone. Zolpidem + caffeine 300 mg was not stronger than zolpidem + caffeine 150 mg in impairing immediate memory and causing subjective sedation. In study II, zolpidem caused objective and subjective sedation; neither caffeine nor erythromycin modulated the effects of zolpidem or plasma zolpidem concentrations.\nContext 3: Caffeine counteracts various effects of traditional benzodiazepines (BZDs). As zolpidem, a short-acting hypnotic, is an atypical GABAA-BZD agonist, we investigated when caffeine would counteract the effects of zolpidem as well.\nContext 4: Low-dose sublingual zolpidem tartrate demonstrated significant dose-related decreases in latency to persistent sleep and total sleep time (P < 0.001) compared to placebo after MOTN dosing. All subject reports paralleled PSG observations. Zolpidem 10 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing sleep latency and total sleep time (P < 0.001). Zolpidem 5 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing sleep latency (P < 0.001) and total sleep time (P < 0.001). Zolpidem 2.5 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing sleep latency (P < 0.001) and total sleep time (P < 0.001).

For this reason, it can be important to measure the carboplatin AUC and subsequently adjust the dose to achieve a predefined target AUC. The use of limited sampling strategies enables relatively simple measurement and calculation of actual carboplatin AUCs.\nContext 3: Ten patients received i.p. carboplatin alone, 10 received cyclophosphamide and 12 received paclitaxel. The ages of the patients, body surface area, serum creatinine, platelet count before chemotherapy, and the total dose of carboplatin in each patient were similar in all groups. The measured AUC, Cmax, T 1/2, and MRT were similar in these groups. The nadir platelet counts were significantly higher (P = 0.0018) in patients treated with i.p. carboplatin with paclitaxel (12.1 +/- 4.3 x 10(4)/mm3) compared with carboplatin alone (5.2 +/- 3.3 x 10(4)/mm3) or with cyclophosphamide (5.2 +/- 4.8 x 10(4)/mm3). The percentage decrease in platelet counts was significantly lower (62.5 +/- 18.2%) in patients treated with paclitaxel than in the other two groups (81.5 +/- 12.6% carboplatin alone, 88.7 +/- 7.9% with cyclophosphamide).\nContext 4: To determine whether the platelet-sparing effect of paclitaxel is related to changes in pharmacology of carboplatin.\nContext 5: A group of 32 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were treated with intraperitoneal (i.p.) carboplatin-based chemotherapy with carboplatin alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel.

Coculturing EPDCs with H9c2 cardiomyoblasts overexpressing PKR1 promotes EPDC differentiation into endothelial and smooth muscle cells, mimicking our transgenic model. Overexpressing PKR1 in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts or in transgenic hearts upregulated prokineticin-2 levels. Exogenous prokineticin-2 induces significant outgrowth from neonatal and adult epicardial explants, promoting EPDC differentiation. These prokineticin-2 effects were abolished in cardiac explants from mice with PKR1-null mutation. Reduced capillary density and prokineticin-2 levels in PKR1-null mutant hearts supports the hypothesis of an autocrine/paracrine loop between PKR1 and prokineticin-2.\nContext 2: Identification of novel factors that contribute to myocardial repair and collateral vessel growth hold promise for treatment of heart diseases.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CX(3)CR1 polymorphisms with CAD in a large population-based cohort.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CX(3)CR1 polymorphisms with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a large population-based cohort.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CX(3)CR1 polymorphisms with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a large population-based cohort.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of CX(3)CR1 polymorphisms with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a large population", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Unlike creatinine, Cystatin C (CysC) is believed to be independent of body composition in both adults and children. Recent findings in adults, suggesting an improved performance of CysC-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (CysC eGFR) by accounting for body mass, necessitated a careful re-evaluation of this issue in children.\nContext 2: We studied 240 children (median age 11.7 years, range 2-17.9 years, 107 girls), with various kidney diseases, for any change in the relationship between (99)Tc DTPA GFR and CysC eGFR after accounting for body mass. For body mass assessment, body mass index (BMI) z-score was calculated using height-adjusted age, to account for growth retardation secondary to chronic kidney disease.\nContext 3: Recent single-institutional series have examined the relationship of body mass index (BMI) in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) generally without significant increase in serious complications with increasing BMI. This study evaluates the impact of BMI on complication rates using a national cohort.\nContext 4: CysC eGFR did not have a significant correlation with BMI z-score (correlation coefficient = 0.06; P = 0.34). Accounting for BMI z-score did not add to the 65% variance in nuclear GFR explained by CysC eGFR. Moreover, it did not change the regression coefficient of 0.85 between CysC eGFR and nuclear GFR either. On Bland & Altman analysis, the bias of 0.05 and standard deviation of 20.39 also did not improve after accounting for BMI z-score in the revised CysC eGFR formula.\nContext 5: Both cysC-eGFRs were strongly correlated with the r24-hC(Cr) (eGFR(Hoek), r=0.846, p<0.001; eGFR(Rule), r=0.820, p<0.001). The difference between the average eGFR(Rule) (37.1+/-31.2 mL/min/1.73m(2)) and average r24-hC(Cr) (35.3+/-30.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was small, whereas eGFR(Hoek) (41.5+/-32.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was significantly higher than both eGFR(Rule) and r24-hC(Cr). The difference between the average eGFR(Hoek) (41.5+/-32.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and average r24-hC(Cr) (35.3+/-30.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was small, whereas eGFR(Hoek) (41.5+/-32.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was significantly higher than both eGFR(Rule) and r24-hC(Cr). The difference", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Acetaminophen, an analgesic and antipyretic drug, causes fulminant hepatic injury at high doses.\nContext 2: Acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure in industrialized countries. Understanding the mechanisms of APAP-induced liver injury as well as other forms of sterile liver injury is critical to improve the care of patients. Recent studies demonstrate that danger signaling and inflammasome activation play a role in APAP-induced injury. The aim of these investigations was to test the hypothesis that benzyl alcohol (BA) is a therapeutic agent that protects against APAP-induced liver injury by modulation of danger signaling. APAP-induced liver injury was dependent, in part, on Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) signaling. BA limited liver injury over a dose range of 135-540 \u03bcg/g body weight or when delivered as a pre-, concurrent, or post-APAP therapeutic. Furthermore, BA abrogated APAP-induced cytokines and chemokines as well as high-mobility group box 1 release. Moreover, BA prevented APAP-induced inflammasome signaling as determined by interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18, and caspase-1 cleavage in liver tissues. Interestingly, the protective effects of BA on limiting liver injury and inflammasome activation were dependent on TLR4 signaling, but not TLR2 or CD14. Cell-type-specific knockouts of TLR4 were utilized to further determine the protective mechanisms of BA. These studies found that TLR4 expression specifically in myeloid cells (LyzCre-tlr4-/-) were necessary for the protective effects of BA.\nContext 3: Excessive alcohol intake causes an increase in intestinal permeability that induces translocation of gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to the portal vein. Increased LPS in the portal vein stimulates Kupffer cells through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in the liver. Activated TLR4 signaling in Kupffer cells induces various inflammatory mediators including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and reactive oxygen species, resulting in liver injury. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also express TLR4. This study investigates whether TLR4 on bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, including Kupffer cells, or non-BM-derived endogenous cells, such as HSCs, are involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury. Kupffer cells and HSCs were isolated from wild-type (WT) and TLR4-deficient mice. The effects of TLR4 on Kupffer cells and HSCs were determined by flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and Western blotting. Kupffer cells and HSCs were treated with LPS and/or TLR4 agonist, Pam3CSK4, and the effects on the expression of inflammatory mediators were determined.

We analyzed the time taken from HBV DNA loss to viral breakthrough after antiviral treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The early fall of the HBV DNA level to undetectable levels assessed really whether it is related to late breakthrough.\nContext 2: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA often remains detectable in serum despite clinical recovery and loss of HBsAg.\nContext 3: The mean time taken for loss of HBV DNA was 34\u00b128 wk. The baseline ALT differed significantly among groups (A: 382\u00b1274, B: 340\u00b130, C: 166\u00b192, D: 54\u00b1100 IU/L) (p=0.007). Fifty nine of the 91 patients (64.8%) experienced viral breakthrough. The mean interval between HBV DNA loss and viral breakthrough was 65\u00b140 wk and differed significantly between group A, B (82\u00b143 wk) and group C, D (56\u00b128 wk) (p=0.015). In multivariate analysis, only HBV DNA loss within 24 wk, was found to be independently associated with late viral breakthrough (p=0.035). Undetectable HBV DNA after 24 wk was associated with high odd ratio of 3.24 (95% CI, 1.09-9.67).\nContext 4: We prospectively analyzed 12 HBeAg-negative patients and 14 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B, who received at least 9 mo of lamivudine treatment and were followed up for 12 mo post-treatment. Relapse of hepatitis B activity was defined by an elevation of serum ALT level above twice the upper limit of normal as well as reappearance of serum HBV DNA by the branched DNA assay or HBeAg during the follow-up period. The serum viral loads during and at the end of treatment were further determined by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.\nContext 5: In chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, quantitative HBV surface antigen (qHBsAg) is useful for monitoring viral replication and treatment responses.

However, the role of birth weight in the development of diabetic nephropathy is unclear. We, therefore, studied the impact of birth weight on the development of diabetic nephropathy and other related traits, such as diabetic retinopathy and macrovascular disease, in Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients.\nContext 2: Diabetic nephropathy was equally common in the groups with various birth weight (LBW vs NBW vs HBW: 21 vs 20 vs 17%, P = NS). End-stage renal disease (3 vs 5 vs 4%, P = NS), laser-treated retinopathy (31 vs 31 vs 31%, P = NS) and macrovascular disease (5 vs 5 vs 8%, P = NS) were equally prevalent in the various birth weight groups. The time from the onset of diabetes to the onset of diabetic nephropathy was similar irrespective of birth weight (log-rank test; P = NS).\nContext 3: Low birth weight has been suggested as a risk factor for diabetes. Whether it is related to diabetic retinopathy is unclear and is examined in this study.\nContext 4: Data on size at birth were obtained from original birth certificates in 1543 Finnish patients with type 1 diabetes.

Such an association could be due to either higher risk of neoplasia or difficulty examining the colon in patients with diverticulosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether colonic diverticula are associated with an increased risk for colonic neoplasia.\nContext 2: Our analyses included 624 participants. Of these, 216 (35%) had one or more colorectal adenomas. Diverticula on colonoscopy were not associated with an increased risk of adenomas (odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.4) or advanced adenomas (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.5). Those with the greatest burden of diverticula (10 or more) did not have an increased risk of adenomas (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7-1.8) compared with no diverticula. Colonic diverticula were not associated with an increased risk of proximal (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.6) or distal adenomas (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.7).\nContext 3: This study was designed to assess the relationship between diverticulitis and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and colonic adenomas.\nContext 4: Colonic diverticular disease is common among older individuals whereas colonic symptoms, such as those of irritable bowel syndrome, are frequent in the general population.\nContext 5: A total of 128 patients were classified as CDI-D, whereas 137 had CDI-ND. There were no significant differences between CDI-D and CDI-ND when comparing frequencies of repeat infection and its subclassifications, relapse or recurrence. There were, however, statistical associations seen between diverticulosis of the ascending colon and increased recurrence rates [hazard ratio (HR): 1.4\u00b10.38, P<0.05] and decreased rates of relapse in diverticular disease of the descending (HR: 0.40\u00b10.46, P<0.05), and sigmoid colon (HR: 0.39\u00b10.49, P<0.05).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of diverticula on colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of diverticula on colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of diverticula on colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of diverticula on colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Being overweight is a risk factor for colorectal cancer; patients' adequate perception of their risk may lead to better involvement in management. The purpose of this study was to measure perception of risk for colorectal cancer in overweight and obese patients. A consecutive sample of overweight adult patients (n\u2009=\u2009195) attending to nutritional counseling was submitted to clinical questionnaire addressing personal and family data, awareness about colorectal cancer risk factors, health status, and estimates of their own risk. Only 32% identified obesity among CCR risk factors. For 57% of participants, their own current BMI status did not confer any increased risk for CRC. Also, for half (46%) of the patients, their BMI status will not lead to an increased risk during lifetime. For 36%, an increased risk was accurately estimated as two or more. Accurate estimates tend to be made by older patients (p\u2009=\u20090.033), those with GI complaints (p\u2009=\u20090.040), or with familial history (p\u2009=\u20090.016). Even among patients attending to a nutritional consultation, only a third of patients seem to adequately consider their own overweight as a potential risk for colorectal cancer during lifetime.\nContext 2: Observational studies have consistently associated obesity with colorectal cancer risk. Because both traits are genetically determined and share some metabolic biomarkers, we hypothesized that obesity-related polymorphisms could also influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nContext 3: Underweight, normal weight, pre-obesity, and obesity were diagnosed in 14 (1.0%), 444 (33.2%), 593 (44.3%), and 287 (21.4%) RCC patients, respectively. A lower BMI was significantly associated with higher age, tumor grade, and the rate of metastasis at diagnosis. Overweight patients had a significantly lower risk of cancer-related death; their median 5-year tumor-specific survival rate was 70.9% (pre-obese), 74.0% (obese grad I), and 85.6% (obese grad \u2265II) as opposed to 63.8% for patients with a BMI below 25 (p < 0.001). Interestingly, subgroup analysis revealed that the positive association between overweight and survival was found in organ-confined RCC only.\nContext 4: Obesity is a convincing risk factor for colorectal cancer. Genetic variants in or near FTO and MC4R are consistently associated with body mass index and obesity. We hypothesized that these variants may also influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variants in FTO and MC4R and the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variants in FTO and MC4R and the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variants in FTO and MC4R and the risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variants in FTO and MC4R and the risk of developing colorectal", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Viral respiratory infections and atopy have been implicated in the pathogenesis of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but the role of atopy is controversial. We aimed to test our hypothesis that atopy, expressed as physician-diagnosed eczema, was associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSA among children who snored.\nContext 2: Data on children who snored and were referred for polysomnography were reviewed. The primary outcome measures were adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSA.\nContext 3: Of the 2100 eligible children, 1471 (71%) returned questionnaires. Children always or often snoring numbered 92 (6.3%), sometimes snoring, 183 (12.4%), and never or occasionally snoring, 1196 (81.3%). No difference in age (p=0.06) or gender (p=0.39) existed between snorers and non-snorers. History of previous adenotonsillectomies (p<0.001), allergic rhinitis (p<0.001), recurrent respiratory infections (p<0.001), and otitis media (p<0.001) were more common among snorers than among occasional or never-snorers. Nocturnal symptoms such as breathing problems, sleep hyperhydrosis, sleep-wake transition disorders, and daytime somnolence were associated with children's snoring. Frequency of children's snoring was also associated with parental snoring (p<0.001) and smoking (p<0.001).\nContext 4: Seventy-three consecutive children (44 males; mean age 5.4+/-1.2 years) with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, who complained sleep-disordered breathing, were studied. All the parents completed a questionnaire concerning the children's sleeping habits and sleep complaints before consultation; each child underwent a general paediatric examination and an evaluation of craniofacial features and upper airway patency. In all 73 children polysomnography was performed and anterior rhinometry nasal patency was measured.\nContext 5: The diagnosis of OSA was confirmed in 44/73 patients (60%). Total nasal resistance showed a significant direct correlation with apnea hypopnea index, arousal index, snoring time, percentage of sleep time spent at SaO(2)<90%, and percentage of sleep time spent at SaO(2)<80%. The percentage of sleep time spent at SaO(2)<90% was significantly higher in children with OSA than in those without OSA (p<0.001). The percentage of sleep time spent at SaO(2)<80% was significantly higher in children with OSA than in those without OSA (p<0.001). The percentage of sleep time spent at SaO(2)<80% was significantly higher in children with OSA than in those without OSA (p<0.001).

This study is a comprehensive determination of reference values for hematology and clinical chemistry in apparently healthy voluntary non-remunerated blood donors and pregnant women.\nContext 2: We assessed the reference change value (RCV) of currently available hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) laboratory assays, which is defined as the critical difference between two consecutive HbA(1c) measurements representing a significant change in health status.\nContext 3: Twenty study samples prepared from pooled sera of outpatients, emergency department,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PPARgamma plays beneficial roles in cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and heart reperfusion. Although PPARalpha and gamma have been documented to reduce oxidative stress in the vasculature and the heart, the role of PPARdelta remains poorly studied.\nContext 2: We focused on PPARdelta function in the regulation of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the rat cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we showed that PPARdelta is the predominantly expressed isotype whereas PPARalpha was weakly detected. By performing cell viability assays, we also showed that the selective PPARdelta agonist GW501516 protected cells from H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. The protective effect of GW501516 was due to an inhibition of H(2)O(2)-triggered apoptosis as shown by annexin-V labeling, DNA fragmentation analysis, and caspase-3 activity measurement. We demonstrated by transient transfection of a dominant negative mutant of PPARdelta that the protection induced by GW501516 was totally dependent on PPARdelta. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis demonstrated that GW501516 treatment upregulated catalase. Moreover, forced overexpression of catalase inhibited H(2)O(2)-triggered apoptosis, as evidenced by annexin-V labeling.\nContext 3: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activators affect the myocardium through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and metabolic modulation but their effect in the progression of heart failure is unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of the PPARgamma activator, GW347845 (GW), on the progression of heart failure.\nContext 4: Data conflict with regard to whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 agonism suppresses inflammation in humans. We hypothesized that in healthy adults peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 agonism with fenofibrate would blunt the induced immune responses to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), an in vivo model for the study of cardiometabolic inflammation.\nContext 5: Nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) plays a fundamental role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, the role of PPAR-\u03b1 in the regulation of inflammation is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of PPAR-\u03b1 activation on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in human monocytes.\nContext 6: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates lipid metabolism and inflammation. PPAR-\u03b1 is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and inflammation. However, the role of PPAR-\u03b1 in the regulation of inflammation is still unclear.

Hepatic iron deposition was determined in 32 HH patients following Perls Prussian blue staining (0-4+). Estimations of the haplotype frequencies were performed utilising the program Arlequin version 2.\nContext 3: Homozygosity for a cysteine to tyrosine translocation at position 282 within the HFE gene (C282Y) is responsible for over 90% of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) in Celtic populations. Determining those C282Y homozygotes at greatest risk for iron overload is a major clinical concern as only a small percentage will develop clinically significant iron overload. Divalent metal transport protein (DMT1) on the apical surface of duodenal enterocytes is recognised as the major iron import protein. We investigated whether genetic variability within the DMT1 gene may partly explain the phenotypic variability seen amongst a group of C282Y homozygotes with iron overload.\nContext 4: The major current concept for the pathogenesis of the Down Syndrome (DS) phenotype including congenital heart disease (CHD) is the so-called \"gene dosage effect.\" According to this hypothesis, genes encoded by chromosome 21 at the \"critical region\" (which is thought to be crucial for the development of the DS phenotype) are overexpressed in the trisomic state, thus leading to an imbalance of genes as, e.g., the protooncogene ets-2, superoxide dismutase, etc.\nContext 5: 150 men were recruited from a genetic screening programme for hereditary hemocromatosis (HH) and were tested for type 2 diabetes, other components of the metabolic syndrome, beta cell function (BCF), insulin sensitivity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and iron overload.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n1.

The HbA(2) determination showed high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of beta-thalassemia trait patients. Mutation analyses revealed 13 beta-thalassemia trait mutations, of which six have not been reported before in Hungarian beta-thalassemia trait patients. Each group of mutations revealed decreased (P < 0.01) mean of blood catalase and catalase-to-hemoglobin ratio. Acatalasemia mutations were not found in beta-thalassemia trait patients.\nContext 3: Thalassemia erythrocytes are exposed to oxidative stress especially to hydrogen peroxide, which is regulated with the enzyme catalase. The aim of this study was to examine blood catalase activity and the relationship of blood catalase and beta-thalassemia gene mutations.\nContext 4: This was a cross-sectional study of 168 patients with \u03b2 thalassemia intermedia treated at two centers in Lebanon and Italy. Data on demographics, splenectomy status, transfusion status, and presence of co-morbidities were retrieved. Laboratory values of serum ferritin, fetal and total hemoglobin levels, as well as platelet and nucleated red blood cell counts were also obtained. Iron burden was determined directly by measuring liver iron concentration using magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were subdivided according to transfusion and splenectomy status into groups with phenotypes of different severity.\nContext 5: Cardiac complications are the major cause of death in patients with beta-thalassemia major. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac complications in patients with beta-thalassemia major and to determine the risk factors for cardiac complications.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac complications in patients with beta-thalassemia major and to determine the risk factors for cardiac complications.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac complications in patients with beta-thalassemia major and to determine the risk factors for cardiac complications.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac complications in patients with beta-thalassemia major and to determine the risk factors for cardiac complications.\nContext 9: The aim of this study", "Question: Are hFE, hepcidin and ferroportin gene mutations present in Indian patients with primary haemochromatosis??\nExplanation: The study was conducted to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in Indian patients with primary haemochromatosis.

The hypothesis was that degenerative rotator cuff changes associated with chronic multitendon tears and muscle unloading would lead to poor structural and mechanical outcomes after repair compared with acute injuries and repair.\nThe study was conducted in 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=12 per group). The rats were divided into 4 groups: 1) acute rotator cuff injury and repair (n=", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors and incidence of angiographic venous obstruction after transvenous lead implantation in both children and young adults.\nContext 2: Venous occlusion is a recognized complication of transvenous pacing, and lead cross-sectional area indexed to body surface area (BSA) has been used to predict venous obstruction in children.\nContext 3: Mean capillary diameter values were significantly different for arterial, venous, and average diameters (mean value of arterial, venous, and apical) between patients with PRP and SRP (p < 0.0001). These alterations were found to be independent predictors for disease development (p = 0.015). Threshold values of 30 \u00b5m (area under the curve = 0.802, sensitivity/specificity = 0.85/0.63) to 31 \u00b5m were identified for average, arterial, and venous diameters, with a shortening effect on time to disease development.\nContext 4: All cases were performed in the operating room with cardiopulmonary bypass standby. Complete lead removal was achieved in 118 (84.3%) patients. Potentially fatal complications occurred in five patients (3.6%) who had superior vena cava and/or innominate vein laceration. Lacerated veins were repaired under emergency sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass. The mean time from vascular laceration to establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass was 6.0 \u00b1 3.6 minutes. All five patients survived without neurological sequelae. The rates of dual-coil leads (80.0% vs. 31.9%, p=0.025) and history of lead revision (100.0% vs. 40.0%, p=0.008) were significantly higher in the five patients who had major vascular laceration than those who did not. Logistic regression showed that dual-coil implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead was an independent risk factor for vascular laceration (odds ratio 11.264, p=0.048).\nContext 5: The geometric mean (GM) of blood lead in the low serum ferritin group was significantly higher than that in the normal group among boys but not girls. After controlling for covariates, multiple regression analysis showed that blood lead was inversely correlated with serum ferritin levels in boys and pre-menarche girls only.\n\nBased on the results of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n1. The incidence of venous obstruction after transvenous lead implantation in children and young adults is 3.6% and 3.6%, respectively. The incidence of venous obstruction is higher in children than in young adults.\n2. The incidence of venous obstruction is higher in patients with a history of lead revision than in those without a history of lead revision.\n3.

A placebo-controlled trial was warranted.\nContext 2: In severe attacks of ulcerative colitis (UC) treated with intravenous corticosteroids, a fulminant colitis index (FCI) greater or equal to 8 has been associated with a greater likelihood of colectomy (72 vs 16% with an FCI<8). This retrospective study aimed to assess the accuracy of such an association in infliximab-treated patients with moderate-to-severe bouts of UC.\nContext 3: In this case-control study we identified 23 patients (21 with Crohn's disease [CD], two with ulcerative colitis [UC]) who developed psoriasis under infliximab (IFX, n\u2009=\u200920), adalimumab (ADA, n\u2009=\u20092), and certolizumab pegol (CZP, n=\u20091) and compared them regarding the anti-TNF-antagonist antibody levels with 85 IBD patients (72 with CD, 13 with UC) on anti-TNF therapy without psoriasis.\nContext 4: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of visilizumab induction treatment in 127 patients with severely active UC despite treatment with \u22655 days of intravenous corticosteroids. Patients received placebo or visilizumab 5\u03bcg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 2. Corticosteroids were tapered according to disease activity. Patients were followed up for 90 days. The primary end point was induction of response at day 45. Secondary end points included remission and mucosal healing at day 45, symptomatic response at day 15 and colectomy.\nContext 5: One hundred fourteen patients (76 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 38 ulcerative colitis (UC)) underwent abdominal surgery for IBD. Fifty-four patients were treated with anti-TNF-alpha within 12\u00a0weeks prior to surgery (anti-TNF group). Postoperative mortality and morbidity were 0% and 21%, respectively. The infection rate was 15%. A significantly higher incidence of postoperative complications was found in patients treated with high-dose steroids (58% vs. 17%; p\u2009=\u20090.003) and in patients with CD (58% vs. 17%; p\u2009=\u20090.003). The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly higher in patients with UC (58% vs. 17%; p\u2009=\u20090.003).

Patients with complement component 1 (C1) inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency may acquire blood-borne infections through infusion of plasma concentrates.\nContext 2: Nine (11%) patients had serum HGV RNA; that is, 7 (17%) of 42 patients previously treated with C1-INH concentrates and 2 of 42 previously untreated patients. HGV RNA was as common in the 19 patients treated with unmodified concentrates as in the 23 given steam-heated concentrates (16 vs. 17%, p = 0.60). Anti-HGV was more common among the recipients of unmodified concentrates than among those given steam-heated concentrates (26 vs. 0%, p = 0.014). HCV RNA was more frequently detected in treated patients than in untreated patients (33 vs. 7%, p = 0.005) and in the 19 recipients of unmodified concentrates than in the 23 treated with steam-heated concentrates (58 vs. 16%, p = 0.003). Only one HGV RNA-seropositive patient had elevated serum aminotransferase activity, compared to 11 with HCV RNA.\nContext 3: The treatment of the rheumatological manifestations associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains difficult. To examine the safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha treatment, nine patients having rheumatological manifestations associated with HCV were treated with etanercept 25 mg twice a week for 3 months.\nContext 4: One hundred and fifty-six consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomly assigned to be treated blind with tapering doses of oral prednisolone or placebo for 4 weeks. Two weeks after cessation of therapy, patients received alpha interferon (3 MU t.i.w.) for 48 weeks and were followed for 24 additional weeks. Response was defined by the presence of normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and negative HCV-RNA in serum.\nContext 5: Recommended management of attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) includes therapy with exogenous C1INH. Thrombotic/thromboembolic events (TEE) have been reported in patients with C1-INH-HAE treated with exogenous C1INH. We report a case of TEE in a patient with C1-INH-HAE treated with exogenous C1INH.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new oral formulation of interferon alfa-2b (IFN-2b) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and to compare it with the standard regimen of IFN-2b (IFN-2b-2MU) in terms of efficacy and safety.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new oral formulation of interferon alfa-2b", "Question: Do perceptions of conflict of interest disclosures among peer reviewers??\nExplanation: The authors assessed the impact of disclosure of financial conflicts of interest (COI) on the reliability of peer review. They used a survey of 410 active reviewers from the Annals of Emergency Medicine to assess their perceptions of COI disclosures and their impact on the reliability of peer review. They found that reviewers were skeptical of financial relationships between authors and industry without a clear or consistent translation of that skepticism into the self-reported actions that characterize manuscript assessment.

H2O2 is generated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system, which is activated by flagellin, a component of Gram-negative bacteria. IL-8 is a chemokine that recruits neutrophils to the site of inflammation. The release of H2O2 and IL-8 is mediated by the activation of the NADPH oxidase", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Small RNAs (sRNAs) are widespread among bacteria and have diverse regulatory roles. Most of these sRNAs have been discovered by a combination of computational and experimental methods. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacterium and opportunistic human pathogen, the GacS/GacA two-component system positively controls the transcription of two sRNAs (RsmY, RsmZ), which are crucial for the expression of genes involved in virulence. In the biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, three GacA-controlled sRNAs (RsmX, RsmY, RsmZ) regulate the response to oxidative stress and the expression of extracellular products including biocontrol factors. RsmX, RsmY and RsmZ contain multiple unpaired GGA motifs and control the expression of target mRNAs at the translational level, by sequestration of translational repressor proteins of the RsmA family.\nContext 2: MicroRNAs play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression and have been identified in every animal with a sequenced genome examined thus far, except for the placozoan Trichoplax. The genomic repertoires of metazoan microRNAs have become increasingly endorsed as phylogenetic characters and drivers of biological complexity.\nContext 3: A combined computational and experimental approach enabled us to identify 14 intergenic regions encoding sRNAs in P. aeruginosa. Eight of these regions encode newly identified sRNAs. The intergenic region 1698 was found to specify a novel GacA-controlled sRNA termed RgsA. GacA regulation appeared to be indirect. In P. fluorescens CHA0, an RgsA homolog was also expressed under positive GacA control. This 120-nt sRNA contained a single GGA motif and, unlike RsmX, RsmY and RsmZ, was unable to derepress translation of the hcnA gene (involved in the biosynthesis of the biocontrol factor hydrogen cyanide), but contributed to the bacterium's resistance to hydrogen peroxide. In both P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens the stress sigma factor RpoS was essential for RgsA expression.\nContext 4: Numerous studies over the past decade have elucidated a large set of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in the human genome. However, the role of lincRNAs in the regulation of gene expression remains largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of a novel lincRNA, named lincRNA-1, in P. aeruginosa. lincRNA-1 was found to be a direct transcriptional target of the GacA two-component system. lincRNA-1 was found to be essential for the expression of the gacA gene, which encodes the GacA protein, and for the expression of the rsmX, rsmY and rsmZ sRNAs. lincRNA-1 was also found to be essential for the expression of the hcnA gene, which encodes the hydrogen cyan", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an oncogene of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Although EBV is associated with 90% of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), the reported detectable expression rates of LMP1 determined by current techniques were from 50% to 80%. This study evaluates the association of LMP1 expression with metastasis in NPC.\nContext 2: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is distinctive among head-and-neck cancers in its undifferentiated histopathology and highly metastatic character. We have recently investigated the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NPC. In a previous study, we found a close association of expression of LMP1, the principal EBV oncoprotein, with expression of Twist and induction of EMT.\nContext 3: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a human epithelial tumour with high prevalence amongst Chinese in Southern China and South East Asia and is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The viral genome harbours an oncogene, namely, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene and known variants such as the 30-bp deletion and loss of XhoI restriction site have been found. Less is known about the relationship between these variants and the population characteristics and histological type.\nContext 4: In NPC tissues, overexpression of Snail is associated with expression of LMP1 in carcinomatous cells. In addition, expression of Snail positively correlated with metastasis and independently correlated inversely with expression of E-cadherin. Expression of Twist had no association with expression of E-cadherin. Further, in a human nasopharyngeal cell line, LMP1 induces EMT and its associated cellular motility and invasiveness. Expression of Snail is induced by LMP1 in these cells, and small hairpin RNA (shRNA) to Snail reversed the cellular changes. By contrast, Twist did not produce EMT in these nasopharyngeal cells.\nContext 5: To evaluate the effect of combining circulating Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) DNA load data with TNM staging data in pretherapy prognostication of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    -", "Question: Does total adiponectin predict cardiovascular events in middle-aged men in a prospective, long-term follow-up study??\nYes, total adiponectin predicts cardiovascular events in middle-aged men in a prospective, long-term follow-up study.\nNo, total adiponectin does not predict cardiovascular events in middle-aged men in a prospective, long-term follow-up study.\nMaybe, total adiponectin does not predict cardiovascular events in middle-aged men in a prospective, long-term follow-up study.\nContext 1: Plasma total adiponectin is a marker of insulin resistance, but its role in predicting cardiovascular events is unclear.

Spasticity of the hip, knee and ankle flexors and extensors was measured using a modified Ashworth Scale and the dose of daily oral baclofen was recorded. After overnight fasting, plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity were measured in response to an oral glucose tolerance test.\nContext 4: Obesity is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a novel and convenient method to measure body fat mass. The correlation between BIA and adenoma risk is unknown.\nContext 5: 677 men and women aged 85 years were included. The average BMI of the population was 24.3\u00b14.2kg/m2 and the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 32.6% and 9.5%, respectively. The impedance index was significantly associated with TBW in both men (n=274, r=0.76, p<0.001) and women (n=403, r=0.96, p<0.001); in regression models, the impedance index remained associated with TBW after adjustment for height, weight and gender, and further adjustment for serum osmolarity and haematocrit. The impedance index values increased with BMI and the relationship was not modified by hydration status.\nContext 6: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a non-invasive technique for the assessment of body composition.

It is associated with increased hemodynamic instability, systemic embolization, and complications linked to anticoagulant therapy. Oxidative stress and consequent electrophysiological remodeling have been proposed as a cause of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Ascorbic acid supplementation was suggested as a novel and effective preventive agent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of ascorbic acid to reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients.\nContext 2: Atrial fibrillation occurs after approximately 25% to 45% of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. Oxidative stress and related electrophysiological remodeling has been proposed as a potential cause of this atrial fibrillation. Perioperative supplementation of the antioxidant ascorbic acid has been evaluated as a preventive agent. The current investigation was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ascorbic acid in reducing atrial fibrillation in CABG patients.\nContext 3: The ascorbic acid group consisted of 52 patients and the control group included 53 patients. The groups were well matched for baseline demographics, preoperative medications, comorbidities, and had similar intraoperative characteristics. The incidence of atrial fibrillation in the ascorbic acid group was 13.5% and 18.9% in the control group (p=0.314). No difference was found between groups in the time of occurrence of atrial fibrillation (3.71\u00b11.89 vs. 2.91\u00b11.58 days after the surgery; p=0.342). There was also no difference in the other observed postoperative complications.\nContext 4: A prospective randomized single-center trial was conducted in patients scheduled for an elective on-pump CABG surgery. Subjects in the ascorbic acid group received 2g of ascorbic acid 24h and 2h before the surgery and 1g twice a day for five days after the surgery. Postoperatively, the patients were monitored for atrial fibrillation and other complications.\nContext 5: A decrease in ascorbic acid (AA) plasma concentration is well known during the postoperative period and postulated to be caused by increased radical scavenging activity in response to surgical trauma. This often affects postoperative patients and is associated with multiple organ failure. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid supplementation on postoperative complications in patients", "Question: Does peritoneal ventilation with oxygen improve outcome after hemorrhagic shock in rats??\nYes, peritoneal ventilation with oxygen improves outcome after hemorrhagic shock in rats.\nThe study by Kwon et al. (2010) showed that peritoneal ventilation with oxygen improved outcome after hemorrhagic shock in rats. The study was conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock and resuscitated with either lactated Ringer solution (RL) or HTS. After intraperitoneal injection of feces, Escherichia coli, or lipopolysaccharide, peritoneal neutrophil accumulation and bacterial clearance were studied.

The data show that the number of travelers with fecal-orally transmitted diseases decreased in the Netherlands from 1995 to 2006. This decrease was associated with improvements in hygienic standards at travel destination.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The prognosis of neuroblastoma (NB) patients when detected before 1 year of age is excellent, particularly in patients whose disease is detected by screening. In some institutions patients with stage I or II NB detected by screening have been observed closely without any treatment. Most showed tumor regression or maturation and are surviving without tumor resection. Resection of infantile NB sometimes is complicated by vascular accidents resulting in vanishing kidney or intestinal infarction. The role of surgery in the treatment of infantile NB therefore is becoming controversial. The authors have treated infants who have easily resectable primary tumors with resection and sampling for lymph node metastases. If the resection of the primary tumor seemed difficult, only biopsy was performed initially followed by chemotherapy with or without resection. The authors analyzed the clinical outcome of the infantile NB in their institution to elucidate the role of surgery in this particular group of patients.\nContext 2: To establish the significance of chromosome 17 aberrations in the biology of neuroblastomas, the fresh-frozen material of 53 primary neuroblastomas (average patient age: 20.8 months; stage 1 or 2: n = 10; stage 3: n = 10; stage 4: n = 10; stage 4s: n = 23) was studied by means of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Follow-up data were available for 52 of 53 cases studied (average follow-up period: 26.4 months). Except for one, all cases had previously been analyzed for MYCN status (semiquantitative Southern blot analysis). Studies of LOH 1p36 (VNTR-PCR) had been performed on 28 of 53 cases.\nContext 3: Glioblastoma is a rare central nervous system neoplasm in pediatric patients. Few studies focused exclusively on this disease in this population. Available literature suggests that this disease behaves differently between pediatric and adult patients. We set out to study patients younger than 18 years of age, carrying the diagnosis of glioblastoma not of the brainstem, their clinical characteristics and clinical factors associated with clinical outcome.\nContext 4: High-dose, pulse-13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA) given after intensive cytotoxic therapy improves event-free survival for high-risk neuroblastoma (NB), but more than 50% of patients have tumor recurrence.\nContext 5: Surgeries for CNS tumors are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with CNS tumors who underwent surgery and to identify risk factors for postoperative complications.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with CNS tumors who underwent surgery and to identify risk factors for postoperative complications.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with CNS tumors who underwent surgery and to identify risk factors for postoperative complications.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with CNS tumors who underwent surgery and to identify risk factors for postoperative complications.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with", "Question: Does universal leukocyte reduction of transfused red cells provide benefit to patients undergoing cardiac surgery??\nExplanation: The use of leukocyte-reduced red blood cells (LRBCs) has been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative infections in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the effect of LRBCs on mortality and morbidity is not known. We investigated the effect of LRBCs on mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We also evaluated the effect of LRBCs on the incidence of postoperative infections. We studied 1,000 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG between 2003 and 2007. Patients were randomly assigned to receive LRBCs (n", "Contexts:\nContext 1: After being coated with plasminogen, the surfaces of fibrin clots became essentially non-adhesive for U937 monocytic cells, blood monocytes, and platelets. The data revealed that activation of fibrin-bound plasminogen by the plasminogen-activating system assembled on adherent cells resulted in the generation of plasmin, which decomposed the superficial fibrin layer, resulting in cell detachment under flow. The surfaces generated after the initial cell adhesion remained non-adhesive for subsequent attachment of leukocytes and platelets.\nContext 2: Although leukocytes and platelets adhere to fibrin with alacrity in vitro, these cells do not readily accumulate on the surfaces of fibrin clots in vivo. The difference in the capacity of blood cell integrins to adhere to fibrin in vivo and in vitro is striking and implies the existence of a physiologic antiadhesive mechanism. The surfaces of fibrin clots in the circulation are continually exposed to plasma proteins, several of which can bind fibrin and influence cell adhesion. Recently, we have demonstrated that adsorption of soluble fibrinogen on the surface of a fibrin clot results in its deposition as a soft multilayer matrix, which prevents attachment of blood cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that another plasma protein, plasminogen, which is known to accumulate in the superficial layer of fibrin, exerts an antiadhesive effect.\nContext 3: Regulation of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is critical in the control of fibrin deposition. While several plasminogen activators have been described, soluble plasma cofactors that stimulate fibrinolysis have not been characterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of beta(2)-glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI), an abundant plasma glycoprotein, on tPA-mediated plasminogen activation.\nContext 4: In 38 patients with AMI, we investigated the effects of a thrombolytic regimen with half reteplase (r-PA) dose plus abciximab vs. full dose r-PA on membrane-bound adhesion molecules (CD41, CD42b, CD40, CD40L) expressed on platelets, neutrophils and monocytes as well as on soluble platelet-selectin as interaction and activation markers of these cells.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thrombolytic regimen with half reteplase (r-PA) dose plus abciximab vs. full dose r-PA on membrane-bound adhesion molecules (CD41, CD42b, CD40, CD40L) expressed on platelets, neutrophils and monocytes as well as on soluble platelet-selectin as interaction and activation markers of these cells.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a thrombolytic regimen with half reteplase (r-PA) dose plus abciximab vs. full dose r-PA on membrane-bound adhesion molecules (CD41, CD42b", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The influence of chronic prostatitis on serum PSA level is well known. Whether it also influences potential new biomarkers of prostate cancer (PCa) has to be determined. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the effect of chronic prostatitis on the PCa urinary marker PCA3.\nContext 2: Four patients had an eventual diagnosis of urethritis and all had a PCA3 score less than 5. Among the remaining 34 patients, 7 had bacterial chronic prostatitis (NIH II prostatitis), 11 had abacterial chronic prostatitis (NIH IIIa), and 16 had non inflammatory prostatodynia (NIH IIIb). All these patients had a PCA3 score less than 28, that is, under the cutoff of 35, which is commonly used for prostate cancer diagnosis. Patients with NIH category IIIa prostatitis had significantly higher number of leukocytes and red cells as well as prostate cells in urine samples but their PCA3 scores did not differ from those of other prostatitis patients.\nContext 3: A urinary PCA3 test was prospectively performed in 432 consecutive patients who were admitted to Gradenigo Hospital (Turin, Italy) between January and December 2011 and scheduled for first or repeat prostate biopsy as a result of an elevated PSA level and negative DRE. A comparison of the PCA3 score and patients with a negative biopsy (normal parenchyma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, HG-PIN) or positive biopsy was performed.\nContext 4: PCA3 median (range) scores varied significantly (P < 0.001) in men with a negative vs positive biopsy: 33 (2-212) and 66 (5-324), respectively. By contrast, men with chronic prostatitis and HG-PIN showed no significant difference with respect to PCA3 score compared to other negative biopsy patients. No correlation was found between the number of positive cores for chronic prostatitis, HG-PIN and PCA3 score. Of all patients with a positive biopsy, 23 (20%) of 114 men had a PCA3 score \u2264 35. In total, 79 (40%) of 197 men with a negative biopsy (normal parenchyma and benign prostatic hyperplasia), 24 (37.5%) of 64 men with chronic prostatitis and 19 (39.6%) of 48 men with HG-PIN had a PCA3 score \u2264 35.\nContext 5: The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with a positive biopsy compared to men with a negative biopsy (P < 0.001). The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with chronic prostatitis and HG-PIN compared to men with a negative biopsy (P < 0.001). The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with a positive biopsy compared to men with a negative biopsy (P < 0.001). The PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with chronic prostatitis and HG-PIN compared to men with a negative biopsy (P < 0.001).

The TLR4 gene is located on chromosome 9q32-q33 and has been mapped to the region of chromosome 9p13-q13.1. The TLR4 gene encodes a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial products. The TLR4 gene has been shown to be involved in innate immune recognition with subsequent proinflammatory cytokine release including TNF. A single nucleotide polymorphism (+896A-->G) resulting in the amino acid substitution (Asp299Gly) has been shown to interrupt TLR-4 mediated signalling. This SNP has been shown to be associated with RA susceptibility in", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess the effect of adding lumen diathermy fulguration to our standard technique of vas ligation with polyglactin 910 (Vicryl(TM), Ethicon, Sommerville, NJ, USA) excision and fascial interposition, in an attempt to improve our sterilization rates. We previously reported the effect of changing suture material on vasectomy success rates; 3005 post-vasectomy semen analyses (PVSA) revealed a decrease in sterilization rates after surgery on changing from chromic catgut to polyglactin 910.\nContext 2: There were 592 vasectomies in all; the age distribution of patients between the groups treated with the standard and new method was similar. Overall, 166 patients (28%) failed to provide two semen samples as instructed, and so were excluded from further analyses. Sterility was achieved in 367 patients (86%); a further 28 (7%) have indeterminate analyses to date, with one of the last two PVSAs showing sperm, with the PVSA of 32 (7%) patients showing persisting sperm. For the eight surgeons reviewed the sterility rates were broadly similar.\nContext 3: Vasectomy, STI, and marital status did not differ significantly between two cohorts. Controls reported premarital sex more commonly than cases (P < 0.001). Cases had the first intercourse at older age (P = 0.03) and had less SPM (P < 0.001). TT, FT, and ES were higher in controls (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, TT, calculated FT, SPM >4, and age at time of marriage <24 were protective against PC. The protective effect of high SA and SHs increased as patients' age increased.\nContext 4: A prospective study was performed in which 316 patients used EMLA cream (178) or no topical anesthesia (138) before vasectomy. EMLA cream was applied by patients 1 hour before the scheduled time of surgery. Bilateral percutaneous no-scalpel vasectomy was then performed in the 2 groups with local infiltration of 1% lidocaine into the scrotal wall and vasal sheath. Following the procedure patients were asked to rate their associated pain using a visual analog scale. Statistical analysis was performed using the 2-sided Student t test.\nContext 5: Men hospitalized for vasectomy were randomized to receive either a single dose of 0.5% bupivacaine or no local anesthetic. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative pain. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, the incidence of urinary retention, and the incidence of wound infection. The incidence of postoperative pain was significantly lower in the bupivacaine group (P < 0.001). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly lower in the bupivacaine group (P < 0.001). The incidence of urinary retention was significantly lower in the bupivacaine group (P < 0.001). The incidence of wound infection was significantly lower in the bupiv", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Atherosclerosis is a complex, chronic disease that usually arises from the converging action of several pathogenic processes, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and the accumulation of oxidized LDL. Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is a LDL- and HDL-bound enzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates PAF and prevents LDL-cholesterol oxidation, thus delaying the onset of atherosclerotic disease.\nContext 2: We evaluated the relationship between variants of the PAF-AH gene polymorphisms Arg92His, Ile198Thr, and Ala379Val and the presence of carotid atherosclerosis in 190 hypercholesterolemic Sicilian individuals. Carotid artery intima-media wall thickness (IMT) was measured as an indicator of early atherosclerotic disease. The participants were classified according to having normal (< or =1 mm) or abnormal (> or =1 mm) IMT and were also investigated for physical characteristics and biochemical indices, including PAF-AH activity.\nContext 3: Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is characterized by several phenotypes, including an atherogenic lipoprotein profile, low grade inflammation, visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. In this study, we investigated which of the clinical and biochemical characteristics of FCH patients contributes most to their increased risk of cardiovascular disease, by determining the association of a broad variety cardiovascular risk factors with the intima media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) in 94 FCH patients and 216 non-affected relatives.\nContext 4: Lipid profiles, apolipoproteins, and carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) were analyzed in 40 type I GD patients, 34 carriers and 41 control subjects. cIMT is a non-invasive validated biomarker for the status of atherosclerosis and present and future cardiovascular disease risk.\nContext 5: To elucidate whether high plasma levels of Lp(a) contribute to the development of early atherosclerotic vessel wall changes, the intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries [CCA-IMT] of 151 healthy young volunteers without additional relevant cardiovascular risk factors was measured by high-resolution ultrasound. Plasma concentrations of Lp(a) were quantified and other established risk factors, such as body mass index [BMI], blood pressure, and serum lipids, were determined.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the plasma levels of Lp(a) and the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in a large population-based sample of 1,000 healthy individuals. The study population consisted of 1,000 individuals (mean age 55.5 years) who were free of cardiovascular disease and who were recruited from the general population of the city of Uppsala, Sweden.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the currently used referral letters are reliable enough to allow that pathway.\nContext 2: General practitioner (GP) letters referring patients under the Two Week-Wait Rule for suspected colorectal cancer were prospectively reviewed over a 6-month period. Three examining consultants were asked to outline the tests they would perform having only read the letter, and then again after a clinical consultation with the patient. The outcome of these tests was tracked.\nContext 3: The aim of this study was to compare 5-year survival rates in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who underwent potentially curative surgery before and after the introduction of the 2-week wait (2WW) referral system.\nContext 4: Wait times are a growing concern in Canada's publicly-funded healthcare system. We sought to determine if increased wait times for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatments resulted in worse outcomes.\nContext 5: A total of 217 referral letters of patients referred under Two Week Wait Rule for suspected colorectal cancer were studied. Having just read the referral letter, the most frequently requested test was colonoscopy (148), then CT scan (48), barium enema (44), followed by gastroscopy (23) and flexible sigmoidoscopy in 15 patients (some patients would have had more than one test requested). After consultation with the patients, tests requested as guided by the GP letter were changed in 67 patients (31%), where 142 colonoscopies, 61 CT scans, 37 barium enemas, 23 flexible sigmoidoscopies and 19 gastroscopies were organised. The referral indication which had tests changed most often was definite palpable rectal mass (67%), while patients referred with definite palpable right-sided abdominal mass had their tests least often changed (9%). A total of 22 patients were found to have colorectal cancers (10%) and 30 patients were diagnosed with polyps (14%). Out of 142 colonoscopies performed, 19 (13%) showed some pathology beyond the sigmoid colon and of the 23 patients who had flexible sigmoidoscopy initially, only three went on to have colonoscopy subsequently. During the 6-month period of the study, only five breaches of the waiting time targets were recorded (1 to the 31-day target and 4 to the 62-day target). The 5-year survival rate was 90% for patients who underwent potentially curative surgery before the introduction of the 2WW referral system and 85% for those who underwent potentially curative surgery after the introduction of the 2WW referral system.\nContext 6: The 2-week wait (2WW) referral system for suspected colorectal cancer was introduced in 2007 in Ontario, Canada. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the currently used referral letters are reliable enough to allow that pathway.\nContext 7: General practitioner (GP) letters referring patients under the Two Week-Wait Rule for suspected colorectal cancer were prospectively reviewed over a 6-month period.

The MSCs were infected with Ad-RAR-\u03b2. Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the expression and localization of RAR-\u03b2. The MSCs were treated with 1 \u00b5mol/l ATRA and modified neuronal induction medium (MNM). Soma size and axon length of induced neurons were measured. Neural specific markers were detected by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence to evaluate neuronal differentiation.\nContext 2: The 1300 bp fragment of RAR-\u03b2 gene was confirmed to be correctly cloned in the adenovirus vector. Cloudiness amplification of Ad-RAR-\u03b2 was observed in HEK293 cells during package. After 48 h of Ad-RAR-\u03b2 infection, about 70% of MSCs were RFP-positive. RAR-\u03b2 expression was increased by about 1988-fold and located in the nucleus. RAR-\u03b2 over-expression did not affect neuronal differentiation efficiency; however, soma size of induced neuron cells enlarged from 716.25 \u00b195.96 \u00b5m(2) to 1160.12 \u00b1352.65 \u00b5m(2) and axon length from 64.17 \u00b111.88 \u00b5m to 83.98 \u00b113.69 \u00b5m. Neural markers other than nestin - NSE, MAP-2, Tau, and Tuj1 - were increased by 4- to 11-fold in RAR-\u03b2 over-expressed neuron cells with ATRA/MNM induction compared with the Ad-null control group.\nContext 3: The retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway plays important roles in neural development. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) activates the RA signal by regulating RAR-\u03b2 in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived neuron cells. Here, we try to investigate whether RAR-\u03b2 over-expression can affect neuronal differentiation of MSCs.\nContext 4: Currents of Cl- were assessed in transfected HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch clamp.

In this study, we assessed the relevance of this subclinical inflammation with regard to radiographic progression.\nContext 2: On patient level, BME, synovitis and tenosynovitis were associated with radiographic progression, independent of known risk factors (p=0.003, 0.001 and 0.011, respectively). Of all non-swollen joints (n=932), 232 joints (26%) had subclinical inflammation (\u22651 MRI-inflammation feature present). These joints were distributed among 91% of patients. Radiographic progression was present in 4% of non-swollen joints with subclinical inflammation compared to 1% of non-swollen joints without subclinical inflammation (relative risks (RR) 3.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 9.6). Similar observations were done for BME (RR5.3, 95% CI 2.0 to 14.0), synovitis (RR3.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 9.3) and tenosynovitis (RR3.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 12.7) separately.\nContext 3: Synovial inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may progress despite clinical remission. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is increasingly used to detect synovial inflammation in RA. Although small joints such as metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are mainly affected by RA, MRI findings have never been directly compared to histological synovitis in MCP synovial tissue. The objective of the current study was therefore to analyse if DCE-MRI relates to histological signs of synovitis small RA joints.\nContext 4: 1130 joints (unilateral metacarpophalangeal 2-5, wrist and metatarsophalangeal 1-5) of 113 early arthritis patients underwent clinical examination and 1.5\u2005T MRI at baseline, and radiographs at baseline and 1 year. Two readers scored the MRIs for synovitis, bone marrow oedema (BME) and tenosynovitis according to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scoring System (RAMRIS). The presence of synovitis, BME and tenosynovitis was compared to the presence of RA disease activity (DAS28-CRP) and radiographic progression (RPA) at 1 year.\nContext 5: Synovitis, BME and tenosynovitis were present in 20%, 13% and 9% of joints, respectively. Synovitis was present in 17% of joints with RPA, 10% of joints with DAS28-CRP>3.2 and 5% of joints with RPA and DAS28-CRP>3.2.

Splenectomy, an integral part of protocol for ABO-I LT, decreases anti-ABO antibodies. With the preoperative rituximab prophylaxis, role of the splenectomy for ABO-I LT is now under debate. We investigated the necessity of splenectomy by retrospective analyses of the short-term anti-ABO antibody response and long-term outcomes of ABO-I LT.\nContext 2: Preoperative rituximab with plasma exchange effectively reduced anti-ABO antibodies in both patient groups at the time of LT. There was no statistically significant difference observed in anti-ABO immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody titers between the \"splenectomy\" and \"nonsplenectomy\" groups during the initial 8 weeks. The clinical outcomes, including AMR, biliary complications, infections, and survival, were similar in both the groups.\nContext 3: Thirty-seven ABO-I LTs performed from May 2006 through July 2009, at Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan, were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-seven patients who underwent splenectomy (splenectomy group) received 329.6 \u00b1 35.8 mg rituximab 17.7 \u00b1 11.9 days before living donor LT. Ten patients without splenectomy (nonsplenectomy group) received 320.0 \u00b1 10.3 mg rituximab 26.6 \u00b1 21.3 days before transplantation. All patients received a posttransplant hepatic artery infusion with prostaglandin E1 and methylprednisolone. Perioperative anti-ABO immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody titers, rejections, biliary complications, infections, and survival results were compared.\nContext 4: Hypersplenism was improved in all patients. Protein synthesis in the liver was improved, which significantly correlated with these patients' increased liver volume. Having a large spleen and a low serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are predictive factors for favorable improvement of liver function after splenectomy. Splenectomy was safely carried out in all patients without major complications except for portal thrombus occurred in 4 patients, but did not affect the long-term outcomes.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that splenectomy is not necessary for ABO-I LT. The preoperative rituximab prophylaxis effectively reduced anti-ABO antibodies in both patient groups at the time of LT. There was no statistically significant difference observed in anti-ABO immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody titers between the \"splenectomy\" and \"nonsplenectomy\" groups during the initial 8 weeks. The clinical outcomes, including AMR, biliary complications, infections, and survival, were similar in both the groups.", "Question: Does knee ligament behavior following a controlled loading protocol differ by menstrual cycle day??\nExplanation: The loading protocol produced a measurable increase in displacement but not stiffness. Neither displacement nor stiffness measures however were affected by day of the menstrual cycle. No consistent relationships between hormonal concentrations and displacement or stiffness were evident.\nContext 1: Over the course of 10 weeks, repeated knee laxity measurements were taken on 27 high-level female athletes, before and after exercise. Point in the menstrual cycle was determined with charts of waking temperature and menstruation. The independent effects of menstrual phase and exercise were evaluated using generalized estimating equations.\nContext 2: The loading protocol produced a measurable increase in displacement but not stiffness. Neither displacement nor stiffness measures however were", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Acute renal failure is a frequent complication following orthotopic hepatic transplantation. A reduction in the synthesis of intrarenal vasodilator prostaglandins has been proposed as having an important role in the pathogenesis of renal insufficiency associated with hepatic dysfunction, as well as in the nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine and FK506 immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, administration of vasodilator prostaglandins may improve renal function following hepatic transplantation. This study was designed to determine the effect of continuous intravenous alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) on postoperative renal function in hepatic transplant patients.\nContext 2: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 21 patients who had undergone orthotopic hepatic transplantation and had a measured postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less that 50 mL/minute received intravenous alprostadil at 0.6 microgram/kg/hour or placebo for five days. Glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by a single-injection clearance method using a radionuclide agent in 53 patients within 12 hours after admission to our surgical intensive care unit. Usual postoperative care was not modified. Radionuclide GFR and ERPF measurements were repeated on postoperative day 3. Serum creatinine was measured preoperatively and postoperatively on day 3 and on day 5. A 24-hour serum creatinine clearance was measured on days 1, 5, and 14. Urine output was recorded hourly during the infusion period.\nContext 3: Seven adult liver transplant recipients participated in a randomised cross-over pharmacokinetic study comparing ursodiol (600 mg) with placebo in single doses. Blood concentrations of CsA were measured by HPLC.\nContext 4: Our study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 patients; 50 received placebo and 50 received a loading dose of 140 mg/kg of intravenous (IV) NAC over 1 h followed by 70 mg/kg IV repeated every 4 h for a total of 12 doses. Both groups were followed up for 1 year post-orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). We recorded liver function tests, renal function tests, graft survival, patient survival, plasma GSH and duration of hospital and ICU stay. In addition, we recorded the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of acute rejection and the incidence of", "Yes, deletion of the Snord116/SNORD116 alters sleep in mice and patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome.\nExplanation: Sleep disturbances are common in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome that is associated with paternally-expressed genomic imprinting defects within the human chromosome region 15q11-13. One of the candidate genes, prevalently expressed in the brain, is the small nucleolar ribonucleic acid-116 (SNORD116). Here we conducted a translational study into the sleep abnormalities of PWS, testing the hypothesis that SNORD116 is responsible for sleep defects that characterize the syndrome.\nWe studied sleep in mutant mice that carry", "Yes, traditional healers in The Gambia have a role in TB diagnosis and treatment.

The prevalence of eye signs in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is 34%, of whom about a quarter had chronic upper eyelid retraction (UER), determined as a margin-reflex distance of >5 mm, as the main sign. There was no correlation between eye signs and cigarette smoking. Overall, there was only a modest correlation between eye signs and positive antibody tests, and 40% of patients with no eye signs at the time of study were antibody positive.\nContext 1: Overt ophthalmopathy is presumed to be uncommon in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis compared to Graves' disease, where significant", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Distal colonic adenomas found on flexible sigmoidoscopy are associated with proximal neoplasias, thus requiring a complete colonoscopic examination, but data regarding the association of distal mixed polyps with proximal neoplasia are lacking. We conducted this study to elucidate the significance of distal mixed colonic polyps in predicting proximal neoplasia.\nContext 2: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients who underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopic examination for colorectal cancer screening and a follow-up colonoscopic examination because of distal colonic polyps. Distal index polyps were classified by a pathologist as early tubular adenoma (ETA), serrated, or true mixed categories. Index polyps also were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody, Adnab-9, a marker for the colorectal adenoma carcinoma sequence.\nContext 3: Demographics and risk factors for colon cancer were comparable between the two groups. At baseline the mean frequency and size of adenomatous polyps were similar in cases and controls (P > 0.05) and at follow-up, these were 0.89 and 1.18 (P > 0.05; 95% CI of -0.08 to 0.66) and 4.09 mm and 4.00 mm (P > 0.05; 95% CI -2.29 to 2.11), respectively with no significant change. However, control group had a higher mean frequency and size of hyperplastic polyps at baseline as well as at follow-up colonoscopy (P < 0.05).\nContext 4: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of data from 1910 patients (59.3 \u00b1 8.0 years, 53.8% female) who underwent an average-risk screening colonoscopy from August 2005 through April 2012 at Indiana University Hospital and an associated ambulatory surgery center. Colonoscopies were performed by an endoscopist with high rates of detection of adenomas and serrated polyps. Tissue samples of all serrated polyps (hyperplastic, sessile serrated adenoma/polyp [SSA/P], or traditional serrated adenoma) proximal to the sigmoid colon and serrated polyps >5 mm in the rectum or sigmoid colon were reviewed by a gastrointestinal pathologist and reclassified on the basis of World Health Organization criteria. Advanced adenomas were defined as those with villous or tubulovillous histology, or those with a high-grade dysplasia component. The mean age of patients was 59.3 \u00b1 8.0 years, 53.8% were female, and 59.3% were white. The mean number of polyps per patient was 2.2 \u00b1 1.1. The mean number of advanced adenomas per patient was 0.2 \u00b1 0.3. The mean number of serrated polyps per patient was 1.1 \u00b1 0.8.

At follow-up, the participants completed the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Age, sex, complications, length of hospital stay, start time of surgery, and education level of surgeons were recorded.\nContext 2: Between June 2008 and October 2012, 22 cases of tibial large segment defect were treated. There were 15 males and 7 females, aged 24-58 years (mean, 36.8 years), including 17 cases of postoperative nonunion or malunion healing, and 5 cases of large defect. After debridement, bone defect size was 5.0-12.5 cm (mean, 8.05 cm). Bone transportation was performed by ring type external fixator combined with locked intramedullary nail, the mean indwelling duration of external fixation was 10.2 months (range, 2-26 months); the external fixation index was 1.57 months/cm (range, 0.3-3.2 months/cm); and the mean length increase was 8.05 cm (range, 5.0-12.5 cm).\nContext 3: To explore the effectiveness of bone transportation by ring type extenal fixator combined with locked intramedullary nail for tibial non-infectious defect.\nContext 4: All patients were followed up 19-58 months (mean, 32 months). No infection occurred after operation and all patients obtained bony union, and the union time was 4.7-19.4 months (mean, 11.9 months). Complications included refracture (1 case), skin crease (1 case), lengthening failure (1 case), foot drop (2 cases), retractions of the transport segment (1 case), delay of mineralization (1 case), which were cured after corresponding treatment. According to Hohl knee evaluation system to assess knee joint function after removal of external fixator and intramedullary nail, the results were excellent in 15 cases, good in 5 cases, and fair in 2 cases, with an excellent and good rate of 90.9%; according to Baird-Jackson ankle evaluation system to evaluate ankle joint function after removal of external fixator and intramedullary nail, the results were excellent in 15 cases, good in 5 cases, and fair in 1 case, with an excellent and good rate of 90.9%.\nContext 5: The results of this study showed that bone transportation by ring type external fixator combined with locked intramedullary nail for tibial non-infectious defect is effective and safe.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients with tibial non-infectious defect treated with bone transportation by ring type external fixator combined with locked intramedullary nail.\nContext 7: The results of this study showed that bone transportation by", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To find out if there is any link between the therapeutic effect of toremifene on premenstrual mastalgia and luteal phase serum inhibin A and/or B levels.\nContext 2: Forty-eight patients participating in a randomized cross-over trial on toremifene vs. placebo for premenstrual mastalgia gave three blood samples during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle: the first at baseline, the second during the third toremifene/placebo cycle, and the third during the third placebo/toremifene cycle, respectively. The blood samples were analyzed for inhibin A and B with respective specific two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Toremifene (20 mg/d) and placebo were administered during the luteal phase only.\nContext 3: Early luteal phase steroid concentrations achieved by exogenous administration were comparable with levels observed following ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF. No difference in the luteal phase length was observed comparing all groups. However, a significant decrease in LH levels could be observed 6 days after the mid-cycle LH surge (P<0.001) in women receiving P, resulting in accelerated decrease of inhibin A production by the corpus luteum (P=0.001).\nContext 4: When all the toremifene-treated cycles were compared with all the placebo cycles and with the baseline, the median inhibin A levels were 42, 38, and 40 pg/ml, respectively (baseline versus toremifene, p = 0.638; baseline versus placebo, p = 0.468; and toremifene versus placebo, p = 0.365). The median inhibin B levels were at baseline 19 ng/l, during placebo 20 ng/l, and during toremifene 17 ng/l (baseline versus toremifene, p = 0.983; baseline versus placebo, p = 0.519; and toremifene versus placebo, p = 0.880).\nContext 5: No statistically significant difference was found in follicular-phase inhibin B levels or midluteal inhibin A levels between cases and controls. Significant negative correlation was observed between follicular-phase inhibin B concentrations and BMI in ELF patients but not among controls. LH and FSH were positively related to inhibin B levels in ELF patients. Midluteal inhibin A correlated with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in ELF patients but not in controls.\nContext 6: The inhibin B levels were significantly lower in the group of patients with a history of infertility than in the group of patients without a history of infertility (p = 0.001). The inhibin B levels were significantly lower in the group of patients with a history of infertility than in the group of patients without a history of infertility (p = 0.001).

The current study aimed to examine caregiving experiences as predictors of change in family caregivers' spiritual well-being during the initial months following the patient's cancer diagnosis.\nContext 2: Seventy family caregivers of newly diagnosed cancer patients (74% female, mean age\u2009=\u200959 years) participated in this longitudinal survey. Caregivers completed baseline questionnaires shortly before staying with the patient at an American Cancer Society Hope Lodge. Baseline questionnaires assessed caregiving experiences (i.e., self-esteem related to caregiving, family support for providing care, impact of caregiving on finances, and impact of caregiving on one's schedule). In addition, caregivers' spiritual well-being (i.e., meaning in life, peace, and faith) was assessed at baseline and 4-month follow-up.\nContext 3: In univariate analyses, all caregiving experiences studied were associated with one or more aspects of spiritual well-being at 4-month follow-up. However, in the multivariate analysis, the only caregiving experience associated with aspects of spiritual well-being at 4-month follow-up was caregivers' perceptions of family support. Specifically, lack of family support was associated with lower levels of meaning and peace.\nContext 4: Existential/spiritual needs of advanced cancer patients are not always met in healthcare. Potential barriers for health professionals exploring existential concerns include lack of time, training, tools, and confidence. Yet patients with life-threatening illnesses require holistic care, and interest in their existential/spiritual needs is growing. Preparation and life completion interventions have shown positive results in the existential/spiritual care of hospice-eligible patients in the United States. Nurses are in the ideal position to deliver such interventions, but have not been previously evaluated in this context.\nContext 5: Patients discussed their life story, forgiveness, and heritage and legacy over 3 audiotaped sessions. Preintervention/postintervention outcome measures included the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Spirituality Well-being, Profile of Mood States, Quality of Life at End of Life Scale, and Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale.

The ligaments of the ankle are responsible for stabilizing the joint and preventing excessive movement. The ligaments of the ankle are made up of collagen fibers that are arranged in a complex pattern. The ligaments of the ankle are divided into three groups: the anterior, posterior, and lateral ligaments. The anterior and posterior ligaments are the most important ligaments of the ankle. The anterior ligament is the strongest ligament of the ankle and is responsible for stabilizing the ankle in a neutral position. The posterior ligament is the weakest ligament of the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The mechanism of the antiemetic actions of corticosteroids is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if betamethasone can prevent nausea, vomiting or increase of vasopressin induced by apomorphine. Metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, was used as a control substance.\nContext 2: One volunteer decided to withdraw, as he experienced akathisia after receiving metoclopramide. During the first two hours after apomorphine, eight of nine volunteers vomited both after betamethasone and placebo. One volunteer did not vomit after betamethasone and placebo but he experienced nausea. None of the volunteers vomited after metoclopramide (P < 0.01 vs betamethasone and placebo). The maximum VAS for nausea was significantly higher after betamethasone and placebo compared to metoclopramide (P < 0.01). The vasopressin levels increased after betamethasone and placebo, but there was no increase in any volunteer after pretreatment with metoclopramide.\nContext 3: Ten healthy volunteers were studied on three occasions. In a randomized order they were allocated to receive pretreatment with betamethasone 8 mg iv, metoclopramide 10 mg iv, and normal saline 2 mL as placebo on the three different occasions, 15 min before the administration of apomorphine 30 microg x kg(-1) s.c.. After administration of apomorphine, episodes of vomiting were recorded, and the intensity of nausea was estimated by the subject on a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10 cm). Blood samples for analysis of plasma concentrations of vasopressin were analyzed.\nContext 4: Corticosteroids reduce the incidence of PONV but the mode of action is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if betamethasone has serotonin (5-HT) antagonistic effects. Ipecacuanha is known to release serotonin and therefore it was used to induce nausea and vomiting. The 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron was used as a control substance.\nContext 5: During the first 2 h after ingestion of ipecacuanha nine of the 10 volunteers vomited both after betamethasone and placebo. No volunteer vomited after ondansetron (P < 0.01 vs betamethasone and placebo). The maximum VAS for nausea was significantly higher after betamethasone and placebo compared to ondansetron (P < 0.01).

Although reports indicate p38 signalling plays a role in early skeletal development, its specific contributions to adult bone remodelling are still to be clarified.\nContext 2: We evaluated osteoblast-specific deletion of p38\u03b1 to determine its significance in early skeletogenesis, as well as for bone homeostasis in adult skeleton. Early p38\u03b1 deletion resulted in defective intramembranous and endochondral ossification in both calvaria and long bones. Mutant mice showed reduction of trabecular bone volume in distal femurs, associated with low trabecular thickness. In addition, knockout mice also displayed decreased femoral cortical bone volume and thickness. Deletion of p38\u03b1 did not affect osteoclast function. Yet it impaired osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast maturation and activity through decreased expression of osteoblast-specific transcription factors and their targets. Furthermore, the inducible Cre system allowed us to control the onset of p38\u03b1 disruption after birth by removal of doxycycline. Deletion of p38\u03b1 at three or eight weeks postnatally led to significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone volume after 6 or 12 months.\nContext 3: Whereas alphaCGRP-/- -mice display an osteopenia at all ages analyzed, the Calca-/- -mice develop a phenotype of high bone turnover with age. Histomorphometric analysis performed at the age of 12 months revealed significant increases of bone formation and bone resorption specifically in the Calca-/- -mice. This severe phenotype that can result in hyperostotic lesions, can not be explained by obvious endocrine abnormalities other than the absence of CT.\nContext 4: PTH stimulates bone formation in Fgfr3 knockout mice through promotion of proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts.\nContext 5: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates osteoblast function by binding to the PTH receptor 1 (PTHR1) to activate downstream signaling to induce expression of primary response genes (PRGs), which affect various aspects of the osteoblast phenotype. We previously identified PTH-induced PRGs in MC3T3-E1 cells, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 (MKP1), which is a negative regulator of p38 MAPK. Here, we investigated the role of MKP1 in PTH-induced osteoblast differentiation and function.\nContext 6: We found that MKP1 is a negative regulator of p38 MAPK in osteoblasts. MKP1 expression was induced by PTH in MC3T3-E1 cells and in primary osteoblasts. MKP1 knockdown in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts resulted in increased p38 MAPK activity and decreased osteoblast differentiation. In addition, MKP1 knockdown in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts resulted in increased oste", "Question: Does obesity continue to increase in the majority of the population in mid-Sweden-a 12-year follow-up??\nYes, obesity continues to increase in the majority of the population in mid-Sweden-a 12-year follow-up.\nNo, obesity does not continue to increase in the majority of the population in mid-Sweden-a 12-year follow-up.\nMaybe, obesity continues to increase in the majority of the population in mid-Sweden-a 12-year follow-up.\nNo, obesity does not continue to increase in the majority of the population in mid-Sweden-a 12-year follow-up.\nNo, obesity does not continue to increase in the majority of the population in mid-Sweden-a 12-year", "Question: Is combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation superior to calcium supplementation alone in improving disturbed bone metabolism in patients with congestive heart failure??\nExplanation: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and is associated with increased mortality.

Efficacy and safety at this dose was evaluated (phase 2).\nContext 2: Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a cytokine that has been reported to exhibit potent tumoricidal effects in animal tumor models. A combined approach using Paclitaxel and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the most commonly used backbone regimen for treating lung cancer. Despite numerous studies regarding the anti-tumor effects of IL-12 and the widespread use of conventional chemotherapy, few direct comparisons of IL-12 and conventional chemotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer have been performed.\nContext 3: The study included 53 metastatic renal cell cancer patients, who were treated with 2 induction cycles of IL-2 subcutaneous immunotherapy (6 million IU/day for 5 days/week for 6 weeks, corresponding to one cycle). Tumor regression occurred in 15/53 patients, 20 patients had a SD, and the remaining 18 cases progressed. Non progressed patients (n = 35) underwent a maintenance therapy consisting of one week of therapy every month. After a median follow-up of 18 months, 26/35 patients with response or SD had progressed. The immune investigation consisted of lymphocyte, T lymphocyte, NK cell number determination and sCD25 level detection.\nContext 4: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common kidney cancers and is highly resistant to chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that interleukin-22 (IL-22) may mediate host defense against varietal pathogens as a proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine. The purpose of this study is to assess the inhibitory effects of IL-22 on human RCC cell line A498 and to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor effects of this cytokine.\nContext 5: Renal cell carcinoma most commonly metastasizes to the lung.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the addition of doxazosin extended-release (ER) to the standard management of hypertension in patients with inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP) on arterial stiffness and arterial vasodilation.\nContext 2: Doxazosin ER add-on therapy was associated with significantly reduced systolic (P < 0.0001) and diastolic (P = 0.0003) BP, improved arterial stiffness (determined by digital volume pulse analysis (P = 0.048) and albuterol-mediated arterial vasodilation (P = 0.030).\nContext 3: Twenty patients with inadequately controlled hypertension were treated with 4 mg doxazosin ER daily for 16 weeks as an adjunct to their existing antihypertensive regimen.\nContext 4: Dopexamine infusion (0.5 -2 microg x kg x min(-1)) was associated with enhanced hemodynamic function (MAP 65 +/- 5.5 vs 92 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, P = <0.05) only during the period of aortic cross clamping. However, during the most part of infrarenal abdominal aortic surgery, dopexamine did not reduce systemic vascular resistance index, mean arterial pressure nor oxygen extraction compared with the control group. The lactulose/ rhamnose permeation ratio was elevated above normal in both groups (0.22 and 0.29 in groups I and II respectively).\nContext 5: Ten hypertensive patients and ten matched normotensive subjects were studied in a three-way, randomized, single-blind and placebo-controlled study. On each study day, forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to handgrip exercise were assessed before and after intra-arterial (brachial) infusion of sildenafil, verapamil (a control, cGMP-independent vasodilator), and saline (placebo). Preinfusion exercise-induced vasodilatation was significantly reduced in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive controls. Sildenafil and verapamil infusions both caused a similar increase in baseline FBF. However, while verapamil did not affect the vasodilator response to handgrip exercise in either group, sildenafil substantially enhanced this response in hypertensive patients.\nContext 6: The effect of doxazosin ER on arterial stiffness and vasodilation was studied in 20 patients with inadequately controlled hypertension. Doxazosin ER was added to the standard antihypertensive regimen. Arterial stiffness was assessed by digital volume pulse analysis and arterial vasodilation by albuterol-mediated vasodilation. Arterial stiffness was reduced by doxazosin ER (P = 0.048). Arterial vasodilation was enhanced by doxazosin ER (P = 0.030).\nContext 7: The effect of doxazosin ER on arterial stiffness and vasodilation was studied in 20 patients with", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To assess Down syndrome as an independent risk factor for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization in children younger than 3 years of age and to evaluate illness severity.\nContext 2: The study included 633\u2008200 children and 3\u2008209\u2008378 person-years. Children with Down syndrome had a hospitalization rate of 9.6% vs 2.8% in children without Down syndrome. Down syndrome had a greater adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for RSV hospitalization than most risk factors, 3.46 (95% CI 2.75-4.37). A sensitivity analysis demonstrated HR 3.21 (95% CI 2.51-4.10) for patients with Down syndrome ages 0-23 months and HR 5.07 (95% CI 2.21-11.59) ages 24-36 months. The median (IQR) length of stay of children with and without Down syndrome was 4 days (2-7) and 2 days (1-4) (P <.001). Patients with Down syndrome had a greater risk of requiring respiratory support (relative risk 5.5; 95% CI, 2.5-12.3). The median (IQR) ages at admission for children with and without Down syndrome were 9.8 months (5.5-17.7) and 3.5 months (1.7-8.7) (P <.001).\nContext 3: A retrospective cohort study of children enrolled in the military health system database was conducted. The effect of Down syndrome on RSV hospitalization was assessed by Cox proportional hazards model, while we controlled for risk factors. Disease severity was assessed by length of hospital stay, need for respiratory support, and age at hospitalization.\nContext 4: In total, 142 samples were obtained. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus (73%) followed by rhinovirus (RV) (30%). In 58 samples (41%) more than one virus was detected, of which 41% was a dual infection with RSV and RV. In RSV infected children younger than 3 months, disease severity was not associated with the number of detected viruses. Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono-infections.\nContext 5: The major objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of RSV infection in children with Down syndrome and to compare the clinical characteristics of children with Down syndrome and those without Down syndrome. The study included 1\u2008000\u2008000 children and 3\u2008209\u2008378 person-years. Children with Down syndrome had a higher prevalence of RSV infection than children without Down syndrome (9.6% vs 2.8%). Children with Down syndrome had a higher risk of hospitalization for RSV infection (adjusted HR 3.46; 95% CI 2.75-4.37) and a higher risk of requiring respiratory support (adjusted HR 5.5; 95% CI 2.5-12.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: First-MTP-joint motion was assessed using an electromagnetic motion tracking system in cases (n = 15) demonstrating clinically limited passive hallux dorsiflexion in relaxed standing, and in 15 controls matched for age and gender and demonstrating a clinically normal Hubscher maneuver. Maximum hallux dorsiflexion was measured with the subject non-weight bearing (seated), during relaxed standing, and during normal walking.\nContext 2: Hallux dorsiflexion was similar in cases and controls when motions were measured non-weight bearing (cases mean +/- SD, 55.0 degrees +/- 11.0 degrees; controls mean + SD, 55.0 degrees +/- 10.7 degrees), confirming the absence of structural joint change. In relaxed standing, maximum dorsiflexion was 50% less in cases (mean +/- SD, 19.0 degrees +/- 8.9 degrees) than in the controls (mean +/- SD, 39.4 degrees +/- 6.1 degrees; P <.001), supporting the initial test outcome and confirming the visual test observation of static functional limitation in the case group. During gait, however, cases (mean +/- SD, 36.4 degrees +/- 9.1 degrees), and controls (mean +/- SD, 36.9 degrees +/- 7.9 degrees) demonstrated comparable maximum dorsiflexion (P =.902). There was no significant relationship between static and dynamic first MTP joint motions (r = 0.186, P =.325).\nContext 3: To explore the validity of the assumptions underpinning the Hubscher maneuver of hallux dorsiflexion in relaxed standing, by comparing the relationship between static and dynamic first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint motions in groups differentiated by normal and abnormal clinical test findings.\nContext 4: Limitation of motion at the first MTP joint during gait may be due to either structural or functional factors. Functional hallux limitus (FHL) has been proposed as a term to describe the situation in which the first MTP joint shows no limitation when non-weight bearing, but shows limited dorsiflexion during gait. One clinical test of first MTP joint limitation during standing (the Hubscher maneuver or Jack's test) has become widely used in physical therapy, orthopedic, and podiatric assessments, supposedly to assess for the presence of hallux limitations during gait. The utility of the test has been questioned, however, because of the lack of a clear definition of the test, and the lack of a clear relationship between the test and the clinical findings. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between static and dynamic first MTP joint motions in cases and controls, and to determine whether the Hubscher maneuver is a valid test of first MTP joint limitation during gait.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between static and dynamic first MTP joint motions in cases and controls, and to determine whether the Hubscher maneuver is a valid test of first MTP joint limitation during gait.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between static and dynamic first", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common in preterm infants and is associated with significant morbidity. To determine whether the PDA is hemodynamically significant (HSDA), several echocardiographic parameters have been suggested, including retrograde diastolic blood flow in the descending aorta (Dao).\nContext 2: We measured blood flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, cardiac output, and patency of the ductus arteriosus using pulsed Doppler, M-mode, and real-time ultrasound. The initial examination was performed at (mean +/- SD) 7.6 +/- 2 hours and the second examination was performed at 30 +/- 3 hours. The systolic, diastolic, and mean blood flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries increased significantly from day 1 to day 2. Cardiac output did not change significantly (252 +/- 49 vs 279 +/- 69 cm3/kg per minute). Thirteen newborns on day 1, but only two newborns on day 2, had echocardiographic evidence of a patent ductus arteriosus. Newborns whose ductus was already closed on day 1 had similar increases in blood flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries from day 1 to day 2 compared with newborns whose ductus had closed from day 1 to day 2.\nContext 3: To correlate changes in blood flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries with closure of the ductus arteriosus in normal, full-term newborns during the first 2 days following delivery.\nContext 4: Forty-nine infants were included, with a median GA of 27.6 weeks (IQR: 26.1-29.0), birth weight of 980 g (IQR: 800-1,200), and postnatal age of 77 h (IQR: 70-107). Infants with a closed duct (n = 11), a non-HSDA (n = 18), and an HSDA (n = 20) had similar cerebral and renal NIRS measurements. Retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao, present in 11 infants with PDA, also did not affect cerebral and renal NIRS measurements.\nContext 5: Preterm infants whose gestational age<34 weeks and who required PT in the first 3 d of life were enrolled in this prospective study. The clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of these infants were compared with those of infants with a closed ductus arteriosus (n = 11) and those with an HSDA (n = 20). The mean gestational age of the infants with a closed ductus arteriosus was 28.4 weeks (IQR: 26.0-29.8) and the mean gestational age of the infants with an HSDA was 31.8 weeks (IQR: 29.0-34.0). The mean birth weight of the infants with a closed ductus arteriosus was 1,000 g (IQR: 800-1,200) and the mean birth weight of the infants", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We identified 38 patients younger than 18 years at artificial urinary sphincter implantation who did not undergo augmentation enterocystoplasty before or at implantation. We evaluated preoperative bladder capacity and compliance to determine whether these standard preoperative urodynamic measurements predict the eventual need for bladder augmentation in these patients.\nContext 2: The artificial urinary sphincter has been used to treat urinary incontinence in pediatric patients with neurogenic bladders secondary to myelodysplasia. Frequently bladder augmentation is performed in conjunction with the artificial urinary sphincter implantation. Identifying patients with adequate urinary reservoirs who are candidates for implantation without bladder augmentation is a clinical challenge. We reviewed our experience with the artificial urinary sphincter in children with myelodysplasia to determine whether preoperative urodynamic findings predict the need for future augmentation cystoplasty.\nContext 3: In the 15 patients who required eventual bladder augmentation after artificial urinary sphincter implantation mean bladder capacity plus or minus standard deviation was 62.9+/-29.9% of age expected capacity and mean bladder compliance was 8.0+/-4.8 ml./cm. water. In the 23 patients who did not require eventual bladder augmentation mean bladder capacity was 59.2+/-25.4% of age expected capacity and compliance was 7.0+/-3.3 ml./cm. water. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups.\nContext 4: One hundred fifty-one patients were available for analysis, 115 without previous surgery and 36 after at least one previous sphincter repair. The median follow-up was 13 (range, 1-64) months and 20 (range, 2-96) months, respectively. The median incontinence score improved from 18 to 5 (P < 0.0001) in patients without previous repair and from 17.5 to 7 (P < 0.0001) in patients after previous repair. In the former group, the outcome was good in 67 (58 percent) patients, adequate in 19 (16.5 percent), and poor in 29 (25.5 percent). In the group with previous sphincter repair, the outcome was good in 18 patients (50 percent), adequate in 4 (11 percent), and poor in 14 (39 percent; P = 0.2646). The median time to first incontinence was 3 (range, 1-12) months in the group without previous repair and 4 (range, 1-12) months in the group with previous repair (P = 0.0001). The median time to first incontinence was 3 (range, 1-12) months in the group without previous repair and 4 (range, 1-12) months in the group with previous repair (P = 0.0001).\nContext 5: The artificial urinary sphincter is a useful treatment for patients with neurogenic bladder and incontinence.

Our previous studies have shown that a single subretinal injection of human cortical-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPC\nContext 2: Bimodal imaging provided serial detection of graft: placement, architecture, and survival; each undetectable under ophthalmoscopy. Bimodal imaging determined graft placement to be either: subretinal (n=7), choroidal (n=4), or vitreal (n=4) indicating neural retinal perforation. Graft architecture was highly variable at the time of transplantation, with notable redistribution over time, while complete, or near complete, graft loss was observed in the majority of recipients after day 8. Of particular importance was detection of vitreal aggregates overlying the graft-possibly an indicator of host-site inflammation and rejection.\nContext 3: Measurements of outer nuclear layer thickness in the transplant and control groups revealed that normal retinal pigment epithelial cell transplants did not cause photoreceptor cell rescue in rds mice. In addition, outer segments were not seen in retinal pigment epithelial cell-transplanted rds retinas.\nContext 4: GFP allografts underwent no detectable changes in size on days 7 and 12 in the B10-RIII mice injected with IRBP-specific Treg cells; however, mice that received OVA-specific Treg cells or no Treg cells experienced remarkable reductions in graft size on day 12. Only one quarter of the original size was seen. Using neuronal-specific markers, immunohistochemistry showed that the architecture of the retinal allografts in the IRBP Treg cell-injected group had intact rosettes and neuronal cells on the outermost layer, whereas the allografts in the OVA Treg cell-injected mice were disorganized. Immune cell-specific markers demonstrated that Treg cells and activated microglial cells were found in the retinal allografts of the mice injected with IRBP Treg cells, but not in the retinal allografts of the OVA Treg-injected mice.\nContext 5: Human ESC-derived PPCs were transplanted into 15 retinal dystrophic rats that underwent bimodal imaging at 0, 8, and 15 days posttransplant.\n\nBased on the above data, we propose that the following hypothesis is supported: (1) human ESC-derived PPCs are transplanted into the subretinal space of the retina of dystrophic rats and (2) the transplanted PPCs are able to survive and proliferate in the subretinal space of the retina of dystrophic rats. The hypothesis is supported by the following observations: (1) the transplanted PPCs are able to survive and proliferate in the subretinal space of the retina of dystrophic rats; (2) the transplanted PPCs are able to survive and proliferate in the subretinal space of the retina of dystrophic rats; (3) the transplanted PPCs are able to survive", "Yes\nExplanation: Circulating LR11 has been shown a novel marker of intimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in human and animal studies. The present study was performed to clarify the clinical significance of circulating LR11 in patients with stable angina pectoris after coronary stenting.\nContext 1: We firstly investigated the circulating sLR11 levels for 28 days after arterial injury in mice, and then assessed time-dependent change in circulating sLR11 level after coronary stenting in a clinical study. Mouse", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Serum levels of the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) vary depending on the erythropoietic activity and iron status. In vitro, sTfR shed in the incubation medium correlates well with cellular TfR, but this relationship has never been established in vivo. To determine the value of serum sTfR as a quantitative marker of the body mass of tissue TfR, we designed experiments to examine the correlation between serum sTfR and tissue TfR in rats with various degrees of erythropoietic activity or iron status.\nContext 2: The receptor occupancy curves showed that an injected tracer dose of 4.5 nmol/kg induces approximately 10% receptor occupancy, whereas 1% receptor occupancy will be achieved at tracer doses of approximately 0.45 nmol/kg. Using the bolus injection protocol and nonlinear regression analysis, we determined that the average D(2) receptor density was 9.6 \u00b1 1.1 pmol/mL, and the apparent raclopride affinity was 5.0 \u00b1 0.6 pmol/mL. These values agreed well with those obtained at true equilibrium conditions. In contrast, linear Scatchard analysis did not lead to the expected linear relationship because nonsaturable binding was observed at high raclopride concentrations, and thus, it seems to be unsuitable for quantitative (11)C-raclopride analysis in mice.\nContext 3: Mice underwent a total of 4 scans with decreasing specific activities from 141 to 0.4 GBq/\u03bcmol, corresponding to (11)C-raclopride injected doses of 2.4 to 1,274 nmol/kg, using either a standard bolus injection protocol (n = 12) or a bolus-plus-constant infusion protocol to attain true equilibrium conditions (n = 7). Receptor occupancy was plotted as a function of raclopride dose, and D(2) receptor density and raclopride affinity were calculated using linear and nonlinear regression analysis, respectively. In addition, we used ex vivo autoradiography, a more spatially accurate imaging technology, to validate the in vivo PET measurements, and we performed test-retest experiments to determine the reproducibility and reliability of the PET-derived measures.\nContext 4: We measured pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion, determined the activity status of parietal cells on the basis of ultrastructural morphological changes, and evaluated the effects of pentagastrin on the activity of parietal cells in rats with various degrees of gastric acid secretion. The results showed that pentagastrin increased the activity of parietal cells in rats with normal gastric acid secretion, but it had no effect on the activity of parietal cells in rats with low gastric acid secretion. The results also showed that pentagastrin increased the activity of parietal cells in rats with low gastric acid secretion, but it had no effect on the activity of parietal cells in rats with normal gastric acid secretion.

Intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is an emerging treatment strategy for such patients. However, experimental studies suggest that rtPA may exert proedematous effects and lead to increased perihemorrhagic edema (PHE) after ICH. We aimed to compare the course of PHE after ICH between patients who received IVF with rtPA and controls matched for ICH volume.\nContext 3: To examine whether antiplatelet medication use at onset of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with hemorrhage growth and outcome after spontaneous ICH using a large, prospectively collected database from a recent clinical trial.\nContext 4: This study investigated the effect of preexisting antiplatelet therapy on mortality and functional outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\nContext 5: Our cohort included 1739 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator of whom 125 (7.2%) were receiving warfarin before admission and had an international normalized ratio <1.7.

However, the distinct function of PROX1 in gastric cancer is unclear. We determined whether PROX1 affected the oncogenic behavior of gastric cancer cells and investigated its prognostic value in patients with gastric cancer.\nContext 2: A small interfering RNA against PROX1 was used to silence PROX1 expression in gastric cancer cell lines AGS and SNU638. Expression of PROX1 in gastric cancer tissues was investigated by performing immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis were determined by performing the TUNEL assay and immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67, CD34, and D2-40.\nContext 3: Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that control patterning of virtually all organ systems including the vasculature. Tumor angiogenesis is stimulated by several homeobox genes that are overexpressed in tumor cells, but the mechanisms of these genes are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which DLX4, a homeobox gene that is associated with increased tumor microvessel density, stimulates ovarian tumor angiogenesis.\nContext 4: To study the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on the expression of pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) and pancreatic beta-cell regeneration/neogenesis, and their possible mechanisms in diabetics.\nContext 5: PROX1 knockdown induced apoptosis by activating cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and by decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. PROX1 knockdown also suppressed tumor cell proliferation. In addition, PROX1 knockdown decreased lymphatic endothelial cell invasion and tube formation and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C and -D and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. However, PROX1 knockdown only decreased umbilical vein endothelial cell invasion, not tube formation. The mean Ki-67 labeling index and lymphatic vessel density value of PROX1-positive tumors were significantly higher than those of PROX1-negative tumors. However, no significant difference was observed between PROX1 expression and apoptotic index or microvessel density. In addition, PROX1 knockdown did not affect the expression of VEGF-C and -D and COX-2. These results suggest that PROX1 is involved in the regulation of lymphatic vessel formation and tumor angiogenesis, but not tumor cell proliferation.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of homeobox genes in gastric cancer and to determine whether the expression of homeobox genes is associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of homeobox genes in gastric cancer and to determine whether the expression of homeobox genes is associated with the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the", "definitely yes\nExplanation: The study found that the improvement in pulmonary function after LVRS was associated with a significant increase in the elastic recoil pressure of the lung, which was accompanied by a decrease in the elastic recoil pressure of the chest wall.

Our aim was to identify the population of splenocytes that are indispensible for switching from BM to splenocytic chimerism.\nContext 2: In group A, the BM switched to splenocyte-derived BM chimeras. Total B6C3F1 splenocytes created stable splenocyte BM chimeras that permitted long-term retention of skin grafts, without rejection. In groups B and D, the splenocytes failed to replace the recipient BM, and there was no decrease in the number of recipient-derived BM cells compared with group A from d 14 to 28 after splenocyte injection, as was the case for CD8(+) T cells. In group C mice, the recipient BM was slowly and incompletely replaced.\nContext 3: In peripheral blood from 38 patients with MCC and 30 healthy donors, we identified 53 MCPyV-directed CD8 T-cell responses against 35 different peptide sequences. Strikingly, T-cell responses against oncoproteins were exclusively present in patients with MCC, but not in healthy donors. We further demonstrate both the processing and presentation of the oncoprotein-derived epitopes, as well as the lytic activity of oncoprotein-specific T cells toward MHC-matched MCC cells. Demonstrating the presence of oncoprotein-specific T cells among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes further substantiated the relevance of the identified epitopes.\nContext 4: Tolerance to transplanted skin and bone marrow, mismatched for multiple minor histocompatibility antigens, was induced in Fas mutant and control mice using anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies. To test for linked suppression, animals were transplanted with a second graft-bearing tolerated and third party antigens. The ability of splenocytes from tolerant animals to suppress graft rejection was assessed by transfer into partially immunocompromised recipients.\nContext 5: Recipients injected with 3 x 10(6) donor BMCs admixed with 10 x 10(6) donor CD8SP established chimerism. However, recipients injected with the same dose of BMCs admixed with 5 x 10(6) CD4SP, 10 x 10(6) CD4SP, or 10 x 10(6) CD8SP failed to establish chimerism.

Alterations in apoptotic signals and p53 status contribute to drug resistance, and CD95-mediated apoptosis is also deficient in resistant cells. We analyzed the mechanism of resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cell lines differing in p53 status.\nContext 2: CD95-mediated apoptosis was blocked in human ovarian cancer cells. In cell lines with wild-type p53, treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) together with anti-CD95 overcame the resistance, suggesting the presence of a labile inhibiting protein. Indeed, the labile protein cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein long form (c-FLIP(L)) was found to block caspase-8 recruitment to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), and sensitization of cells by CHX was due to c-FLIP(L) down-modulation at the DISC level. Down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) with antisense oligonucleotides increased CD95-mediated apoptosis as in cells sensitized by CHX, demonstrating the direct involvement of c-FLIP(L) in apoptosis resistance. Removal of c-FLIP(L) block at DISC level allowed full activation of the mitochondrial pathway and, eventually, apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells, whereas in cells with mutated p53, c-FLIP(L) involvement in CD95-mediated apoptosis resistance appeared to be irrelevant. Immunohistochemical analysis of an ovarian tumor tissue array revealed c-FLIP(L) expression in samples with no p53 accumulation (P = 0.034), and a significant (P = 0.037) inverse relationship between c-FLIP(L) and p53 expression levels was also observed in 27 epithelial ovarian cancer specimens with known p53 status.\nContext 3: CD95-mediated apoptosis was induced by agonistic anti-CD95 antibody, and the apoptotic cascade was monitored with biochemical and functional assays.\nContext 4: Overexpression of Bax directly induced apoptosis in both ovarian cancer cell lines and the patient-derived primary cancer cells. However, the sensitivity of these cells to Bax varied and appeared to be independent of both the status of p53 and the endogenous levels of bcl-2 or Bax, critical molecules in the apoptotic pathway. Importantly, overexpression of Bax significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in both established cell lines and primary ovarian cancer cells.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that Bax overexpression may be a useful therapeutic strategy in ovarian cancer.\nConclusions: The results of this study suggest that Bax overexpression may be a useful therapeutic strategy in ovarian cancer.\nOvarian carcinoma is a highly lethal malignancy that often becomes resistant to chemotherapy.

We hypothesized that serum lipoxin A(4) levels may be used as an early predictive biomarker of subsequent asthma in young children with acute bronchiolitis.\nContext 2: The mean serum levels of lipoxin A(4) in the groups with acute bronchiolitis (1), acute gastroenteritis (2), and asthma (3) were 0.0430.028, 0.0540.015, and 0.0510.031 ng/ml, respectively. When compared by t-tests, there were no significant differences between Groups 1 and 2, or Groups 1 and 3 (p0.05), despite a significant difference between Groups 2 and 3 (p=0.0392). In a final regression model, serum lipoxin A(4) levels were positively correlated with age, female gender, white blood cell counts, and interleukin-5 levels in all patients, while asthma patients had lower serum lipoxin A(4) levels compared to the other two groups.\nContext 3: We recruited 69 children who were divided into 3 groups: 47 children younger than 24 months with acute bronchiolitis as an experimental group (Group 1); 11 children aged 2-24 months with viral acute gastroenteritis as a non-allergic control group (Group 2); and 11 children older than 24 months with physician-diagnosed asthma exacerbations as an asthma control group (Group 3). We determined white blood cell counts, eosinophil counts, and serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, prostaglandin E(2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and lipoxin A(4).\nContext 4: Eosinophilic airways inflammation forms the pathophysiologic basis for a proportion of children at risk of developing recurrent wheezing. Early preventive measures and/or anti-inflammatory treatment may be guided by the identification of such children. We aimed to study the relationship between respiratory symptoms and indirect markers of airway inflammation.\nContext 5: Three hundred thirteen children had full follow-up by age 7 years. In a multivariable analysis the total number of acute clinic visits for asthma symptom was significantly associated with later asthma (P<.0001). The number of acute clinic visits for wheezing was significantly associated with later asthma (P<.0001). The number of acute clinic visits for cough was not significantly associated with later asthma (P=.09). The number of acute clinic visits for runny nose was not significantly associated with later asthma (P=.09). The number of acute clinic visits for sore throat was not significantly associated with later asthma (P=.09).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the number of acute clinic visits for wheezing and asthma in children with acute bronchiolitis.

Using apoptosis and clonogenic survival assays, we found pharmacological inhibition of AKT with selective inhibitors of AKT sensitized MCF-7 mammosphere cells, but not MCF-7 monolayer cells to radiation.\nContext 2: To investigate the effects of Akt/ARK5 pathways on the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells.\nContext 3: MCF-7, human breast cancer cells, were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM and treated with 1 nM 2-OH-E2 or 4-OH-E2. E2 was used as a positive control. Cell proliferation was measured using the BrdU incorporation assay. Cellular levels of cAMP and PKA were determined using ELISA kits. ERK1/2 protein expression was evaluated by Western Blot analysis. To determine the involvement of different intracellular pathways in the regulation of cell proliferation appropriate activators or inhibitors were used.\nContext 4: Mice bearing xenografts of basal-like/EGFR+ SUM149 and HER2+ SUM225 breast cancer cells were treated with lapatinib and fractionated radiotherapy and tumor growth inhibition correlated with alterations in ERK1 and AKT activation by immunohistochemistry.\nContext 5: Human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MCF-7/Her2 were transfected with the let-7 mimics or inhibitors. The expression of \u03b22-AR was analyzed by Western blot. The \u03b22-AR status in primary and metastatic sites of breast cancer and the human breast cancer tissue microarrays containing 49 primary tumors and 50 metastatic lymph node tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of lymph node metastasis with the \u03b22-AR level was determined in 59 primary tumor tissues from the patients with Her2-positive breast cancer. The clinical prognostic significance of the \u03b22-AR overexpression in the patients with Her2-positive breast cancers was evaluated by a retrospective study.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation for your answer.\n1.

We investigated the relationships of the SNPs with hepatic APOC3 expression and hypothesized that visceral obesity may modulate the effects of these SNPs on liver fat and insulin sensitivity (IS).\nContext 2: APOC3 mRNA correlated positively with triglyceride content in liver biopsies (r=0.29, P=0.036). Carriers of the minor alleles (-455C and -482T) tended to have higher hepatic APOC3 mRNA expression (1.80 (0.45-3.56) vs 0.77 (0.40-1.64), P=0.09), but not higher triglyceride content (P=0.76). In 330 subjects the genotype did not correlate with liver fat (P=0.97) or IS (OGTT: P=0.41; clamp: P=0.99). However, a significant interaction of the genotype with waist circumference in determining liver fat was detected (P=0.02) in which minor allele carriers had higher liver fat only in the lowest tertile of waist circumference (P=0.01). In agreement, during a 9-month lifestyle intervention the minor allele carriers of the SNP -482C>T in the lowest tertile also had less decrease in liver fat (P=0.04).\nContext 3: Visceral adiposity is associated with hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The visceral adiposity index (VAI), a novel marker of visceral fat distribution and dysfunction, has been correlated with histology in hepatitis C. We assessed the ability of VAI to predict disease severity in NAFLD and hence its role as a non-invasive marker of liver damage.\nContext 4: APOC3 SNPs were not associated with NAFLD in Italian subjects, although a borderline significance for the transmission of the -455T allele was observed in the family study. Homozygosity for the APOC3 wild-type genotype (APOC3 WT) was associated with a more favorable lipid profile in control subjects, and consistently with lower hepatic fat content in NAFLD patients. In the NAFLD patients, the APOC3 WT genotype was associated with a lower degree of hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and with a lower degree of fibrosis. In the family study, the APOC3 WT genotype was associated with a lower degree of hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and with a lower degree of fibrosis. In the NAFLD patients, the APOC3 WT genotype was associated with a lower degree of hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and with a lower degree of fibrosis.

In all men prostate specific antigen was less\u00a0than 20 ng/ml. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D, prostate specific antigen, free prostate specific antigen and -2proPSA using a commercially available immunoassay system. PHI was calculated according to the equation, -2proPSA/free prostate specific antigen \u00d7 \u221aPSA. We determined 25-hydroxyvitamin D using a 2-step competitive binding immunoenzymatic vitamin D assay.\nContext 3: The 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were not associated with Gleason grade according to the 2014 ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) consensus conference Gleason grading system. PHI values were higher with increasing Gleason grade. Median 25-hydroxyvitamin D did not differ between men with prostate cancer vs no evidence of malignancy (50.6 vs 48.2 nmol/l, p = 0.192) or in ISUP Gleason subgroups despite seasonal variations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. However, PHI values significantly differed between the subgroup with no evidence of malignancy and all Gleason subgroups (p <0.0001). The ROCs of all men revealed an advantage of PHI over 25-hydroxyvitamin D (AUC 0.78 vs 0.535, p <0.0001). PHI could also significantly better separate patients with no evidence of malignancy from those with nonaggressive disease (ISUP Gleason grade 1) from those with aggressive prostate cancer (ISUP Gleason grades 2-5).\nContext 4: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) has been shown to have antiproliferative properties on normal and neoplastic prostatic cells. 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1-alpha-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of vitamin D synthesis, converting 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), is expressed in the prostate.\nContext 5: We investigated the expression of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the prostate and its association with prostate cancer.\nContext 6: We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression in 25 prostate cancer patients and 25 controls. We also investigated the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression with prostate cancer grade, Gleason score, and clinical stage.\nContext 7: We found that 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression was significantly higher in prostate cancer patients compared to controls (p =", "Question: Is an untranslated insertion variant in the uncoupling protein 2 gene related to body mass index and changes in body weight during a 26-year follow-up in Danish Caucasian men??\nExplanation: The UCP2 gene is located on chromosome 11q22.3 and encodes the mitochondrial protein uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2).

Congruent profiles between FFPE MCF7 cells and their fresh counterpart and between amplified and non-amplified FFPE MCF7 cells were observed. Our results demonstrate that formalin fixation of <20 hours has no significant adverse effect on the integrity of DNA for array CGH studies.\nContext 2: While array-comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS or exome) technologies have swiftly spread throughout the medical field, karyotype has gradually lost its leading role among genetic tests. Several international guidelines recommend starting with a-CGH screening then going on with exome analysis when investigating a patient with intellectual disability (ID) and no precise clinical diagnosis. A-CGH and whole exome sequencing increase etiologic diagnoses rate up to 30% in case of ID. However, physicians have to deal with the lack of qualitative information of the genome. Especially, exome and a-CGH analysis fail to detect chromosomal rearrangements because breakpoints are either located in introns or not associated with a gain or loss of genetic material. If these technologies cannot easily identify chromosomal translocations or inversions which sometimes split a gene, karyotype can.\nContext 3: Genomic complexity was significantly associated with MFS. However, there was no statistically significant association between radiological or histological response and genomic complexity.\nContext 4: On gated SPECT and RNA acquisitions, recorded in 20 patients with coronary artery disease, we simulated the consequences of (1) 3-dimensional patient displacements of low (6.7 mm), moderate (13.4 mm), and high amplitude (20.1 mm) and (2) an erroneous triggering on T waves in 10% to 40% of recorded beats. Absolute values of left ventricular ejection fraction changes from baseline were higher with gated SPECT compared with RNA for patient displacements of low amplitude (5.0% +/- 3.8% vs 1.2% +/- 0.9%, P <.001) or moderate amplitude (10.0% +/- 6.2% vs 3.0% +/- 2.3%, P =.001) but not for patient displacements of high amplitude (12% +/- 9% vs 9% +/- 7%, P =.6). The absolute values of left ventricular ejection fraction changes from baseline were higher with gated SPECT compared with RNA for erroneous triggering on T waves in 10% to 40% of recorded beats (5.0% +/- 3.8% vs 1.2% +/- 0.9%, P <.001) or 40% to 60% of recorded beats (10.0% +/- 6.2% vs 3.0% +/- 2.3%, P =.001) but not for erroneous triggering on T waves in 60% to 80% of recorded beats (12% +/- 9% vs 9% +/- 7%, P =.6", "#1\nExplanation: The study aims to compare the effects of a COC containing a progestin with an anti-androgenic profile (estradiol valerate [E2 V]/dienogest [DNG]) to that of one with an androgenic progestin (ethinyl estradiol [EE]/levonorgestrel [LNG]) on sexual function in women with COC-associated sexual dysfunction. The study was conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase, 100 women with COC-associated sexual dysfunction were randomized to receive either a COC containing E2 V/DNG or EE/LNG. In the second phase, 100 women with COC-associated sexual dysfunction were randomized to", "Contexts:\nContext 1: All patients who underwent lung transplantation from 1993 to 1998 and had post-transplant survival of at least 6 months were included in the initial analysis. Subjects were genotyped for: TNF-alpha -308 G/A; IFN-gamma +874 A/T; TGF-beta1 +869 T/C and +915 G/C; IL-10 -1082 A/G, -819 C/T and -592 C/A; and IL-6 -174 G/C. End-points were onset of broncholitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and survival.\nContext 2: Cytokine polymorphisms are inconsistently associated with transplant rejection and other adverse outcomes. To address this controversy, we evaluated cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a lung transplant cohort.\nContext 3: While lung transplantation is an increasingly utilized therapy for advanced lung diseases, chronic rejection in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) continues to result in significant allograft dysfunction and patient mortality. Despite correlation of clinical events with eventual development of BOS, the causative pathophysiology remains unknown. Airway epithelial cells within the region of inflammation and fibrosis associated with BOS may have a participatory role.\nContext 4: Mean donor leukocyte levels for the first 200 days after transplantation were higher in patients with a good transplantation outcome compared with those patients who lost their grafts due to acute rejection (AR) or developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The presence of low numbers of donor-derived leukocytes for the first 200 days after transplantation was found to be a significant risk factor for graft loss due to either acute or chronic rejection (P=0.032). Nearly all patients (85%) experienced AR episodes. However, the time to onset of severe AR episodes was significantly longer (P=0.049), and the incidence of these episodes reduced, in patients who maintained high numbers of donor-derived leukocytes for the first 200 days after transplantation.\nContext 5: Preceding episodes of acute cellular rejection (ACR) may predispose lung allografts to the subsequent development of irreversible dysfunction or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Other histologic patterns such as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), organizing pneumonia, lymphocytic bronchiolitis and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) may also adversely affect allograft function. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between pretransplantation ACR and the subsequent development of BOS.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between pretransplantation ACR and the subsequent development of BOS.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between pretransplantation ACR and the subsequent development of BOS.\nContext 8: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between pretransplantation ACR and the subsequent development of BOS.\nContext 9: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between pretransplantation ACR and the subsequent development of BOS.\nContext 10: The purpose", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Tissue mass and structure are relevant for initiation and persistence of fibrillation. Modification of the right atrium during maze surgery may change the arrhythmogenic substrate of atrial fibrillation (AF).\nContext 2: Epicardial mapping was performed in 9 patients undergoing unmodified maze III surgery for lone paroxysmal AF. Simultaneous recording of AF on the right and left atrium was carried out with two spoon-electrodes each harbouring 64 terminals. Activation maps of AF were made to study AF wavelet organization. The recording position on right and left atria was outside the surgical field and remained unchanged before and after surgery. Before surgery, mean right and left fibrillatory intervals were 174+/-23 ms, and 175+/-26 ms, respectively, and did not differ. After completed right atrial surgery, these fibrillary intervals remained unchanged. Mean right and left atrial dispersion of refractoriness (expressed as the coefficient of variation) were 4.2+/-0.8 and 5.2+/-3.8 ms. Only right atrial dispersion of refractoriness increased significantly after right-sided surgery. Prior to surgery, activation patterns of the left atrium were more complex than that of the right atrium. The left activation patterns became less complex afterwards; the right atrial activation patterns did not change.\nContext 3: Management of atrial fibrillation (AF) is hampered by frequent recurrences after restoration of sinus rhythm. Delayed interatrial conduction has been associated with the development of AF in different clinical settings. The aim of our study was to assess whether advanced interatrial block (aIAB) was associated with AF recurrence after pharmacological cardioversion with two different antiarrhythmic drugs.\nContext 4: Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of cardio-pulmonary bypass and improved pre-operative risk assessment could help guide prophylactic therapy. This study examined whether reduced left atrial appendage flow velocities measured by transoesophageal echocardiography pre-operatively in patients in sinus rhythm predicted development of postoperative atrial fibrillation.\nContext 5: Atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly associates with atrial dilatation by poorly understood mechanisms. We hypothesized that elevation of intra-atrial pressure elicits high-frequency and spatio-temporally organized left atrial (LA) sources emanating from the superior pulmonary veins.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below:\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism of AF in this patient?\n    - What is the most likely mechanism", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism with which fluid flow inhibits endothelial E-selectin expression.\nContext 2: All agonists caused human umbilical vein endothelial cells to express E-selectin protein. Fluid flow inhibited E-selectin protein levels by about 50% in response to TNF-alpha but had no effect on total E-selectin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Flow inhibited E-selectin protein production even after initiation of E-selectin transcription. Flow did not cause E-selectin to be shed from the cell surface nor was E-selectin degradation accelerated. Although fluid flow did not reduce total cellular E-selectin mRNA levels in response to TNF-alpha, the amount of E-selectin mRNA present in the actively translated polysome fraction was markedly attenuated.\nContext 3: Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with inflammatory agonists (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-1beta, oncostatin M, or phorbol ester) in the presence or absence of fluid flow (peak shear stress, approximately 12 dynes/cm(2)) imposed with an orbital shaker. E-selectin expression was assessed with ribonuclease protection assay, immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or metabolic labeling as appropriate.\nContext 4: Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that lymphatic endothelium is sensitive to low levels of transmural flow. Basal-to-luminal flow (0.1 and 1 mum/sec) increased lymphatic permeability, dextran transport, and aquaporin-2 expression, as well as DC transmigration into lymphatics. The latter was associated with increased lymphatic expression of the DC homing chemokine CCL21 and the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin. In addition, transmural flow induced delocalization and downregulation of vascular endothelial cadherin and PECAM-1 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1). Flow-enhanced DC transmigration could be reversed by blocking CCR7, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or E-selectin. In an experimental model of lymphedema, where lymphatic drainage is greatly reduced or absent, lymphatic endothelial expression of CCL21 was nearly absent.\nContext 5: Plasma P-selectin levels, lipid concentrations, and endothelial cell activation were increased in patients with acute coronary syndromes. In contrast, plasma levels of E-selectin, soluble E-selectin receptor, and soluble P-selectin receptor were not increased. These findings suggest that the increased plasma levels of P-selectin and E-selectin in patients with acute coronary syndromes are not due to endothelial cell activation.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism with which fluid flow inhibits endothelial E-selectin expression.\nContext 7: All agonists caused human umbilical vein endothelial cells to express E-selectin protein. Fluid flow inhibited E-selectin protein levels by about 50% in response to TNF-alpha but had no effect on total", "Question: Are dietary intakes of glutamic acid and glycine associated with stroke mortality in Japanese adults??\nExplanation: Glutamic acid and glycine are the most abundant amino acids in the human body.

Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) constitute an endogenous vascular repair system protecting against atherosclerosis. Smooth muscle progenitor cells (SPC) may stimulate atherosclerosis development. We hypothesized that an imbalance in EPC and SPC occurs in CKD, which may contribute to the increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.\nContext 2: The aim of our study was to clarify the hypothesis that proximal tubule (PT) dysfunction may be responsible for early diabetic nephropathy (DN), independently of preceding glomerular endothelial dysfunction. The pattern of endothelial dysfunction and its potential variability was evaluated in two vascular beds, the kidney and the brain.\nContext 3: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is commonly found in chronic dialysis (CD) recipients, and is associated with impaired microvascular cardiac perfusion and heart failure. In response to LVH and cardiac ischemia, early outgrowth pro-angiogenic cellS(EPCs) mobilize from the bone marrow to facilitate angiogenesis and endothelial repair. In the general population, EPC number and function correlate inversely with cardiovascular risk. In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), EPC number and function are generally reduced.\nContext 4: Patients had reduced EPC outgrowth compared to controls [9 (2-22) vs 12 (1-38) cells/10(3) MNC, P = 0.026], independent of CKD cause and degree, whereas SPC outgrowth levels were higher in patients with more impaired kidney function (r = -0.397, P = 0.008). Patients had lower CD34(+)KDR(+)-EPC compared to controls [9 (0-52) vs 19 (4-110) cells/10(5) granulocytes, P = 0.004]. CVD history and increased endothelial dysfunction markers were related to lower EPC levels. Progenitor cell outgrowth was shifted towards SPC with progression of endothelial damage. Reduction in EPC could not be attributed to decreases in progenitor cell-mobilizing factors SDF-1 alpha and VEGF as levels increased with progressive kidney and endothelial dysfunction, while EPC remained low.\nContext 5: Chronic kidney disease is independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; however, the relationship between the kidney and the brain is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the kidney and the brain are both affected by endothelial dysfunction and that the kidney may be a source of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to the brain. We studied the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and EPC in the kidney and the brain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in healthy controls.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in healthy controls.

One group was fed a methionine-rich diet (n=13), and the second group received an equicaloric control diet without methionine supplementation (n=12). Using a closed femoral fracture model, bone repair was analyzed by histomorphometry and biomechanical testing at 4 weeks after fracture. Blood was sampled to measure serum concentrations of homocysteine, the bone formation marker osteocalcin, and the bone resorption marker collagen I C-terminal crosslaps\nContext 2: An elevated serum concentration of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia) has been shown to disturb fracture healing. As the essential amino acid, methionine, is a precursor of homocysteine, we aimed to investigate whether excess methionine intake affects bone repair.\nContext 3: Serum concentrations of homocysteine were significantly higher in the methionine group than in the control group, while serum markers of bone turnover did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Histomorphometry revealed no significant differences in size and tissue composition of the callus between animals fed the methionine-enriched diet and those receiving the control diet. Accordingly, animals of the 2 groups showed a comparable bending stiffness of the healing bones.\nContext 4: We used two groups of mice to investigate the impact of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency on fracture healing: mice of the first group were fed a folate- and vitamin B12-deficient diet (n=14), while mice of the second group received an equicaloric control diet (n=13). Four weeks after stabilizing a closed femur fracture, bone repair was analyzed by histomorphometry and biomechanical testing. In addition, serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12, the bone formation marker osteocalcin (OC), and the bone resorption marker collagen I C-terminal crosslaps (CTX) were measured.\nContext 5: The model was established by feeding rats with a methionine-rich diet (1 g\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9) for 3 months. Immediately following the discontinuation of methionine-rich diet, rats were treated with danshensu (67.5 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9, po) or saline for 3 additional months. One group of rats receiving vitamin mixture (folic acid, 0.5 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9, pyridoxine, 0.5 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9, and cobalamin, 0.5 mg\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9\u00b7d\u207b\u00b9, po) was used as a control group. Four weeks after the discontinuation of the methionine-rich diet, bone repair was analyzed by histomorphometry and biomechanical testing. Serum concentrations of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12, the bone formation marker OC, and the bone resorption marker CTX were measured.\nContext 6: The methionine-rich diet significantly increased serum concentrations of homocyste", "Question: Does retrograde intrarenal surgery as second-line therapy yield a lower success rate??\nExplanation: The success rate of retrograde intrarenal surgery as second-line therapy is lower than that of primary surgery.

Both are characterized by tremor, but PD is associated with bradykinesia and rigidity, whereas ET is associated with post-movement beta synchronisation (PMBS). The pathophysiology of these two disorders is different, but both are associated with a reduction in movement variability. The present study aimed to examine whether combined measures of movement and force variability distinguish PD from ET. We found that PD subjects had significantly lower movement variability than ET subjects, but not force variability. This suggests that the pathophysiology of PD and ET", "Yes, the new immunoassay in stool provides an accurate noninvasive diagnostic method for Helicobacter pylori screening in children.\nThe new immunoassay in stool provides an accurate noninvasive diagnostic method for Helicobacter pylori screening in children.

However, it is unclear whether the same is true in Japan, which has a different healthcare system.\n\nContext 2: Using the Japanese Acute Coronary Syndrome Study (JACSS) database, this study included 4,805 consecutive patients who were admitted within 48 h of onset of AMI (3,526 [73.4%] patients with weekday onset [Monday", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Stroke research and clinical trials have focused mainly on anterior circulation stroke (ACS). Since clinical characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes of posterior circulation stroke (PCS) have been reported different from ACS, more PCS studies are required, particularly researching the etiologies, to help establish an optimal management strategy.\nContext 2: CPB was common in acute stroke (33/138, 24%), but was poorly recognised by clinical staff. Patients with CPB were more likely to have a total anterior circulation syndrome and higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores than those without (both p<0.01). Patients with CPB had significantly higher median SaO2 than those without (p<0.01), unrelated to whether they received oxygen or not. At 3-month follow-up: 91% of patients with CPB were dead or dependent (MRS>or=3) compared with 53% of those without (OR 8.8; 95% CI 2.5-30.5); the association remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (OR 5.9; 95% CI 1.4-25.4).\nContext 3: The present study analyzed patients of PCS who were consecutively admitted and registered in Taipei Veterans General Hospital Stroke Registry between 1 January 2012 to 28 February 2014. We demonstrated the distribution of etiologies, compared the clinical characteristics/outcomes among different etiology groups, and used univariate/multivariate analyses to identify the predictors for poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale \u22655) at discharge and 3\u00a0month.\nContext 4: Within a multi-center cross-sectional study, nested in a cohort we analyzed the relation between prior therapy with APA and stroke severity in 1643 patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Clinical severity of the vascular event was evaluated by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission (NIHSS1) and after 1 week (NIHSS2). By means of analysis of variance we analyzed a possible association of APA with stroke severity and interactions regarding stroke severity between APA and other clinical measures.\nContext 5: All consecutive patients with stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis from 1995 to 2008 at the Helsinki University Central Hospital were registered (n=1104). After excluding basilar artery occlusions (n=119), the study population included 985 patients. Clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2) was assessed at 3 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 3 months, stratified by age, sex, and stroke subtype.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of intravenous thrombolysis on the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The study was conducted in a single center in Taiwan. The study population consisted of 1,000 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with intravenous thrombolysis between January 2008 and December 201", "Question: Is concomitant carcinoma in situ in cystectomy specimens associated with clinical outcomes after surgery??\nExplanation: Concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS) is a common finding in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to externally validate the prognostic value of concomitant CIS in RC specimens using a large international cohort of bladder cancer patients. We conducted a prospective, randomised, single-centre study of 157 consecutive cystectomy patients. Before cystectomy, 182 high-risk patients (44%) had CIS at diagnosis but did not progress to CIS during surveillance (group 1); 69 patients (17%) had CIS that progressed to CIS during surveillance (group 2", "Yes, serum-surfactant SP-D correlates inversely to lung function in cystic fibrosis.\nExplanation: The SP-D Met11Thr polymorphism has been associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections in CF.

The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness are early vascular alterations, linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, with prognostic significance in essential hypertensive patients. P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), responding to extracellular ATP, are encoded by a highly polymorphic gene and modulate inflammatory responses and cell growth, potentially playing a role in the control of vascular tone. This study evaluated the effects of P2X7R gene polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) on a detailed vascular hypertensive phenotype.\nContext 2: We determined by real-time PCR two SNPs of the P2X7R gene (489C>T and 1513A>C) in 134 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive essential hypertensive patients and 131 normotensive controls (CTL). Endothelium-dependent response was assessed as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery, arterial stiffness as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) by tonometry. Markers of oxidative stress were also measured.\nContext 3: Therefore, in this study our aim is to examine whether VEGF polymorphisms affect the antihypertensive responses in women with PE.\nContext 4: FMD was lower (P\u200a<\u200a0.05), whereas aortic PWV and AIx were higher (P\u200a<\u200a0.01) in essential hypertensive patients than in CTL. The allelic distribution of the two P2X7R SNPs was similar in essential hypertensive patients and CTL, either concerning homozygosis or presence of the mutant alleles. No difference was observed for FMD, aortic PWV, AIx or markers of oxidative stress between carriers and noncarriers of the mutant alleles, either in essential hypertensive patients and in CTL. In the whole group, logistic regression showed that the mutant allele of 1513A>C was a main determinant of AIx (odds ratio 1.90; P\u200a=\u200a0.03).\nContext 5: We recruited 775 hypertensives (mean +/- SE: age 53.5 +/- 0.5, from 20 to 84 years; female 32.7%; systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) blood pressure: 159 +/- 1.2/101 +/- 0.6 mmHg) referred to the departmental outpatient clinic and 100 normotensive controls (mean +/- SE: age 53.5 +/- 0.5, from 20 to 84 years; female 32.7%; SBP/DBP: 120 +/- 1.2/80 +/- 0.6 mmHg). We evaluated the association between the P2X7R gene polymorphisms (SNPs 489C>T and 1513A>C) and the antihypertensive response to treatment with amlodipine in hypertensives. The polymorphisms were genotyped by real-time PCR. The antihypertensive response was evaluated by the change in SBP and DBP after 6 months of treatment with aml", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Increased use of nephron sparing surgery has revealed a small but significant percentage of benign tumors. Improved imaging techniques have aided in diagnosis, but are still unable to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. We sought to evaluate whether the intra-tumor Doppler flow pattern could predict the presence of renal cell cancer (RCC).\nContext 2: Standard grayscale ultrasound (US) and Power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) were performed on 40 patients referred to our clinic for suspicious renal masses diagnosed by CT or MRI from December 2007 to May 2010. PDUS findings were used to classify tumors according to vascular patterns as proposed by Jinzaki et al, where pattern 0, 1, or 2 are considered diagnostic of benign renal lesions while patterns 3 and 4 predict malignancy. Clinical and pathological data were reviewed; ultrasound findings were correlated with histopathology.\nContext 3: Current staging for renal cancer (RC) does not directly rely on tumor size. We examined the increment in accuracy related to inclusion of pathologically determined tumor size in prediction of nodal metastases (N+), distant metastases (M+), and cancer-specific survival (CSS).\nContext 4: Relative to ureteral tumors renal pelvis tumors were of higher stage (T3/T4 disease 38.4% vs 57.9%, p <0.001) and had a higher rate of lymph node metastases (6.0% vs 9.8%, p = 0.003) at nephroureterectomy. The respective 5-year cancer specific mortality-free survival estimates were 81.0% vs 75.5% (p = 0.007). However, after multivariable adjustment tumor location failed to reach independent predictor status of cancer specific mortality (p = 0.8).\nContext 5: Pathological stage has been the most widely used prognosticator for evaluating surgically managed cases of renal cell carcinoma. Minimally invasive surgical approaches are being increasingly used to treat small masses for which traditionally pathological information is lacking (morcellation) or absent (radio frequency ablation or cryoablation). Preoperative cross-sectional imaging by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging has been used to stage renal tumors clinically but it can lead to variances with traditional pathological staging systems, particularly with respect to microscopic invasion beyond the renal capsule. In this study we assessed whether radiographically staged clinical T1 lesions that were pathological T1a or T1b could be accurately predicted by preoperative PDUS.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of PDUS in predicting the presence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with a renal mass on CT or MRI. We hypothesized that PDUS would be able to predict the presence of RCC in patients with a renal mass on CT or MRI.\nContext 7: The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of PDUS in predicting the presence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with a renal mass on CT or MRI. We hypothesized that PDUS would be able to predict the presence of RCC in patients with a renal mass on CT or MRI.\nContext 8", "Yes, novel direct cover vitrification for cryopreservation of ovarian tissues increases follicle viability and pregnancy capability in mice.\nExplanation: The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of long-term storage on preservation and viability of cryopreserved human ovarian tissue. The study was conducted in 5- to 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice. The ovarian tissue was cryopreserved using direct cover vitrification (DCV) and conventional vitrification (CV). The ovarian tissue was stored at -80\u00b0C for 1, 2, 3, 4,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The objective of the study is to determine if an ED triage pain protocol improves time to provision of analgesics.\nContext 2: Retrospective data abstracted via electronic medical record of patients at a safety net facility with 67 000 annual adult visits. Patients older than 18 years who presented to the ED between March 1, 2011, and May 31, 2013, with 1 of 6 conditions were included: back pain, dental pain, extremity trauma, sore throat, ear pain, or pain from an abscess. A 3-month orientation to an ED nurse-initiated pain protocol began on March 1, 2012. Nurses administered oral analgesics per protocol, beginning with acetaminophen or ibuprofen and progressing to oxycodone. Preimplementation and postimplementation analyses examined differences in time to analgesics. Multivariable analysis modeled time to analgesics as a function of patient factors.\nContext 3: The quality of pain care was unchanged between visits before and after the pain initiative (P>.05 for all comparisons): subjective provider assessment (49.3% before, 48.7% after), pain exam (26.3%, 26.0%), orders to assess pain (11.7%, 8.3%), new analgesic (8.7%, 11.0%), change in existing analgesics (6.7%, 4.3%), other pain treatment (11.7%, 13.7%), or follow-up plans (10.0%, 8.7%). Patients (n=79) who reported substantial pain often did not receive recommended care: 22% had no attention to pain documented in the medical record, 27% had no further assessment documented, and 52% received no new therapy for pain at that visit.\nContext 4: We retrospectively reviewed medical records at a single medical center to compare providers' pain management before and after implementing the initiative and performed a subgroup analysis of patients reporting substantial pain (> or =4) during a postimplementation visit.\nContext 5: Time to a pain score of <3 [6 (SD 1) vs 6 (1) vs 5 (1) min], time to the lowest pain score [7 (2) vs 8 (2) vs 8 (2) min] and time to the first dose of systemic analgesic for a pain score >3 [281 (95) vs 280 (95) vs 280 (95) min] were significantly shorter in the postimplementation group (P<.05 for all comparisons).\nContext 6: The pain protocol was associated with a significant reduction in time to analgesics (P<.05 for all comparisons).\nContext 7: The pain protocol was associated with a significant reduction in time to the lowest pain score (P<.05 for all comparisons).\nContext 8: The pain protocol was associated with a significant reduction in time to the first dose of systemic analgesic for a pain score >3 (P<.05 for all comparisons).\nContext 9: The pain protocol was associated with a significant reduction in time to analgesics (", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Rejection of pancreatic islet xenografts in mice shares immunopathological features with a Th1-associated delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of acute cellular xenograft rejection in a strain of mice with a targeted gene disruption of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signal adaptor protein MyD88. These mice have been shown to have markedly impaired Th1 immunity.\nContext 2: The MyD88-/- and normal mice were transplanted with 2 microl of fetal porcine islet-like cell clusters (ICC) under the left kidney capsule. On days 3, 6 or 12 after transplantation the mice were killed and the grafts either prepared for immunohistochemistry or real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The number of remaining ICC and infiltrating cells with different phenotypic characteristics was assessed semi-quantitatively. Grafts used for quantitative RT-PCR were analysed for content of murine mRNA of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-4 and IL-10.\nContext 3: Toll-like receptor (1-10), myeloid differentiation primary response gene (MyD88), interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF-3) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) mRNA expression was determined in liver samples of 11 patients with NAFLD and 11 controls. Hepatic PA1-1 and 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts (4-HNE) levels were determined by immunohistochemistry.\nContext 4: Male C57BL/6 mice, B6;129S-Tnfrsf1a(tm1Imx) Tnfrsf1b(tm1Imx)/J knockout mice, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) knockout mice, and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) knockout mice.\nContext 5: We tested the efficacy of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN), synthetic DNA sequences recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 and able to induce innate/adaptive immune response, in two DMPM orthotopic xenografts (MesoII and STO), which properly recapitulate the dissemination pattern of the disease in the peritoneal cavity. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were used to assess the efficacy of CpG-ODN in the treatment of DMPM.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antagonist, 1,3-dimethyl-2-thio-2H-benzimidazole (DMT2), on the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. The effect of DMT2 on the development of EAE was also investigated in the presence of the TLR2 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Toll-like", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Various studies have indicated that acute ethanol dosage perturbs cardiac function and/or structure with concomitant reductions in protein synthesis. Cellular calcium homeostasis is also perturbed, which may contribute to altered protein synthesis. This is supported by the observation that calcium channel blockers can prevent numerous features of alcohol-induced pathology. However, many of these studies have been carried out in vitro, employing supraphysiological levels of alcohol, or have failed to address whether their results obtained in isolated systems have direct relevance in vivo. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the response of cardiac protein synthesis in vivo due to a physiologically relevant dose of ethanol and determine whether a calcium channel antagonist could prevent these effects.\nContext 2: Ethanol (75 mmol/kg body weight) inhibited cardiac protein synthesis after 1 hr. Similar responses were recorded at 2.5 and 6 hr after ethanol dosage. At 24 hr, ethanol decreased food intakes. However, a direct comparison between pair-fed controls and alcohol-dosed rats also showed a decrease in cardiac protein synthesis after 24 hr. Acute alcohol dosage reduced cardiac protein synthesis in mixed, myofibrillary, and sarcoplasmic protein fractions. Similar results were obtained when data were expressed relative to ribonucleic acid (i.e., kRNA). Neither acute nor chronic treatments with the calcium antagonist amlodipine ameliorated the deleterious actions of ethanol on protein synthesis.\nContext 3: Changes in cardiac protein synthesis rates in vivo were assessed by measuring the fractional rates of protein synthesis (i.e., ks) using a \"flooding dose\" of [3H]phenylalanine. Rats were treated either acutely (10 mg/kg body weight, 3 hr) or chronically (10 mg/kg body weight/day, 30 days) with amlodipine, a dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blocker, before dosing with ethanol (75 mmol/kg body weight, 2.5 hr).\nContext 4: Dihydropyridines are widely used for the treatment of several cardiac diseases due to their blocking activity on L-type Ca(2+) channels and their renowned antioxidant properties.\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium antagonist, on the left ventricular remodeling, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction, the change of cardiac gene expression in the myocardial infarction (MI) rats, and the effect of amlodipine on the cardiac function in the MI rats.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of amlodipine on the left ventricular remodeling, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction, the change of cardiac gene expression in the myocardial infarction (MI) rats, and the effect of amlodipine on the cardiac function in the MI rats.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of amlodipine on the left ventricular remodeling, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction, the change of cardiac gene expression in the myocardial infarction (MI) rats", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare albumin with the vasoconstrictor combination of octreotide and midodrine in patients with refractory ascites who underwent LVP. Patients in the albumin group received a single intravenous dose of albumin at the time of LVP plus placebos for midodrine and octreotide (n = 13). Patients in the vasoconstrictor group received saline solution (as a placebo for albumin), 10 mg of oral midodrine (3 times/day), and a monthly 20-mg intramuscular injection of long-acting octreotide (n = 12). Patients were followed up until recurrence of ascites.\nContext 2: Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is the treatment of choice for patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. However, LVP can lead to postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PCD), which is associated with faster ascites recurrence and renal failure. PCD results from vasodilatation, which reduces effective blood volume, and is prevented by intravenous administration of albumin. Vasoconstrictors could be used instead of albumin and, with longer use, prevent PCD and delay ascites recurrence.\nContext 3: The median times to recurrence of ascites were 10 days in the albumin group and 8 days in the vasoconstrictor group (P =.318). There were no significant differences in PCD between the albumin group (18%) and the vasoconstrictor group (25%, P =.574). When ascites recurred, serum levels of creatinine were higher in the vasoconstrictor group (1.2 vs 0.9 mg/dL in the albumin group; P =.051).\nContext 4: We studied 39 cirrhotic patients with sterile ascites. The patients were classified into two groups: group A (18 patients) comprised those with an ascitic total protein level less than 10 g/l and group B (21 patients) those with an ascitic total protein level higher than 10 g/l. Ascitic and serum levels of albumin and immunoglobins G, A and M were analysed.\nContext 5: The fibroblast spreading activity of EPS ascites was about four times greater than that in ascites from a patient with nephrotic syndrome. Two major components of EPS ascites were identified by gel permeation chromatography. The first component was a 10-kDa protein, and the second was a 20-kDa protein.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that the 20-kDa protein is a major component of EPS ascites. The 20-kDa protein may be a marker for the diagnosis of EPS ascites.\nContext 7: The results of this study suggest that the 20-kDa protein is a marker for the diagnosis of EPS ascites.\nContext 8: The results of this study suggest that the 20-kDa protein is a marker for the diagnosis of EPS ascites.\nContext 9: The results of this study suggest that the 20", "Question: Are nifedipine pharmacokinetics influenced by CYP3A5 genotype when used as a preterm labor tocolytic??\nExplanation: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used as a tocolytic for preterm labor. It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. CYP3A5 is the major enzyme responsible for nifedipine metabolism. CYP3A5 is a polymorphic gene that encodes for a protein that is expressed in the liver, intestine, and placenta. CYP3A5 is encoded by a single gene that contains 26 exons. The CYP3A5 gene is located on chromosome 7", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Questionnaires and clinical data from medical records of 97 patients with early stage (stages I and II) cervical cancer were collected and assessed by treatment received. The following treatment groups were analyzed for correlations between time to return to work and various adverse effects: radical hysterectomy (RH) alone, RH group (n = 29); concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT)/radiation therapy (RT) alone, CCRT/RT group (n = 21); and RH + CCRT/RT group (n = 47). The \u03c7 test was used to determine the significance of the correlations.\nContext 2: Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases in working-age women. This study investigated the influence of adverse effects of various treatment modalities on return to work in women with cervical cancer.\nContext 3: Treatment with either calcitriol or radiation significantly inhibited the growth of implanted cervical cancers (p < 0.05 vs. control) and increased the number of dead tumor cells in the tumor sections. However, there was no significant difference in the tumor weights between the mice with radiation alone and both radiation and calcitriol treatment.\nContext 4: Of all patients, 33 had stage IA1 and 26 stage IA2 cervical AC. Also, 42 patients were treated conservatively (ie, conization or simple hysterectomy) and 17 patients were treated radically (ie, radical hysterectomy/trachelectomy with lymph node dissection). Recurrence occurred in 1 patient (1.7%) with stage IA1 disease (grade 1 adenocarcinoma, depth 1.4 mm, and width 3.8 mm, with lymph vascular space involvement [LVSI]) treated by vaginal hysterectomy. The mean follow-up was 79.9 months. From the literature, pooling all data from patients with stage IA1 and IA2 AC, the risk of recurrent disease was 1.5% after conservative therapy and 2.0% after radical therapy.\nContext 5: The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 43.0 years and the average interval since treatment was 4.5 years. The RH + CCRT/RT group was the most strongly negatively associated with return to work in employed patients who had undergone CCRT/RT group of cervical cancer (P = 0.012). There was a significant association between failure to return to work and lower extremity lymphedema (P = 0.001).\nContext 6: The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 43.0 years and the average interval since treatment was 4.5 years.

Injections of either botulinum toxin A (Botox, 2x50 units) or placebo were applied to the subscapular muscle at two locations. Pain was scored on a 100 mm vertical Visual Analogue Scale; external rotation was recorded by means of electronic goniometry. Assessments were carried out at 0 (baseline), 6 and 12 weeks.\nContext 2: To study the effect of botulinum toxin A in the subscapular muscle on shoulder pain and humerus external rotation.\nContext 3: 21 patients completed the study. We observed no significant changes in pain or external rotation as a result of administration of botulinum toxin A. External rotation improved significantly (p = 0.001) for both the treatment group (20.4 degrees (16.6) to 32.1 degrees (14.0)) and the control group (10.3 degrees (19.5) to 23.7 degrees (20.7)) as a function of time.\nContext 4: To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of botulinum toxin depends on the activity of the neuromuscular junction, we developed an in vivo paradigm to determine the degree and duration of low-dose botulinum toxin-induced focal paresis in mice.\nContext 5: Chronic rotator cuff injuries, induced via detachment of the supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus (IS) tendons and injection of botulinum toxin A into the SS and IS muscle bellies, were created in the shoulders of rats. After 8 weeks of injury, tendons were surgically reattached to the humeral head, and an acute, dual-tendon injury and repair was performed on the contralateral side. After 8 weeks of healing, muscles were examined histologically, and tendon-to-bone samples were examined microscopically, histologically, and biomechanically and via micro-computed tomography.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Do shoulder pain and external rotation in spastic hemiplegia improve by injection of botulinum toxin A into the subscapular muscle?\nYes, no, maybe\nExplanation:\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Do shoulder pain and external rotation in spastic hemiplegia improve by injection of botulinum toxin A into the subscapular muscle?\nYes, no, maybe\nExplanation:\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Do shoulder pain and external rotation in spastic hemiplegia improve by injection of botulinum toxin A into the subscapular muscle?\nYes, no, maybe", "Contexts:\nContext 1: PCR primers for highly polymorphic sites within the EDN1 and NOS3 genes were used to genotype individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes with severe or no retinopathy. Allele frequencies were compared between groups using chi-squared analysis and adjusting for multiple comparisons.\nContext 2: In this multicentered study, a total of 235 control subjects with no DR, 158 subjects with nonproliferative DR (NPDR), 132 with proliferative DR (PDR), and 93 with clinically significant macular edema (CSME) were recruited. Blinding DR was defined as severe NPDR, PDR or CSME. DR subjects were drawn from both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) populations. Ten tag single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected to cover the majority of genetic diversity across the CA gene.\nContext 3: A significantly higher frequency of the EE genotype of the K469E polymorphism of the ICAM-1 was found in the patients with PDR compared with those without diabetic retinopathy (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-3.5; P = 0.013), whereas the G241A polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene failed to yield an association with PDR. Moreover, significantly higher sICAM-1 serum levels were demonstrated in diabetics with the EE genotype compared with those with the other (EK + KK) genotypes (918 +/-104 vs. 664 +/-209 microg/L; P = 0.001). The G241A polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene, on the hand, failed to affect sICAM-1 serum levels in diabetics.\nContext 4: In proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) increased levels of cytokines, inflammatory cells and angiogenic factors are present.These factors increase the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs)The objective of this study was to investigate the association between the polymorphisms of the ICAM-1 gene (K469E, G241A) and the development of PDR among patients with type 2 diabetes in the Slovenian population (Caucasians).\nContext 5: Three candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,912 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 2,000 controls. The K469E polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene was significantly associated with PDR (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-2.9, P = 0.02). The G241A polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene was not associated with PDR (OR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.7-1.5, P = 0.9). The K469E polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene was associated with increased serum levels of sICAM-1 (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.0, P = 0", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 isoforms (MEF2A, D) as mediators of the effects of ethanol on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression are unclear. We studied the effects of ethanol in adipocytes in vivo and in vitro.\nContext 2: (1) Long-term ethanol exposure decreased activated AMPK, MEF2A, MEF2D, and GLUT4 expression in rat adipose tissue. (2) In rat and human adipocytes, AICAR-induced AMPK activation, with subsequent elevation of MEF2 and GLUT4 expression, was inhibited by compound C. (3) In vitro ethanol-treatment suppressed the AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway.\nContext 3: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and given ethanol in a single daily dose of 0, 0.5, or 5 g/kg for 22 weeks. The expression of AMPK, MEF2 isoforms A and D, and GLUT4 was measured and compared in the three groups. The existence of the AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway in adipocytes and the effects of ethanol on this pathway were studied in (a) epididymal adipose tissue from six male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR, an AMPK activator) or with 0.9% NaCl (control); and (b) isolated rat and human adipocytes treated with or without ethanol, AICAR, and compound C (a selective AMPK inhibitor). Expression of AMPK, MEF2, and GLUT4 was measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting.\nContext 4: Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in mild steatosis and necrosis, whereas chronic ethanol followed by binge group exhibited marked steatosis and significant increase in necrosis. Chronic binge group also showed significant increase (compared with chronic ethanol alone) in the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), ERK2, and RSK. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK did not increase by the binge. Ethanol binge, after chronic ethanol intake, caused increase in mRNA for egr-1 and PAI-1, but not TNF\u03b1.\nContext 5: Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in mild steatosis and necrosis, whereas chronic ethanol followed by binge group exhibited marked steatosis and significant increase in necrosis.

Gene expression under different conditions was performed. In addition, functional assays including cell proliferation and migration were determined.\nContext 2: Hypoxic conditions cause fibroblasts to differentiate into alpha smooth-muscle cell actin (\u03b1 -SMA)-positive cells, i.e. myofibroblasts. This process is a hallmark of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH) associated with hemodialysis vascular access. The purpose of this study was to determine if blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) may reduce the conversion of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts under hypoxic conditions, and to determine the potential mechanisms involved.\nContext 3: This study demonstrates that contact needs to occur between BOEC and fibroblasts for the reduction of the hypoxia-driven conversion of fibroblasts into \u03b1-SMA. This is associated with a decrease in several proangiogenic genes including vascular endothelial growth factor A, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase 2 in fibroblasts in contact with BOEC when compared to fibroblasts alone. In addition, migration is significantly reduced while proliferation remains unchanged.\nContext 4: Tumours secrete proangiogenic factors to induce the ingrowth of blood vessels, the end targets of which are vascular endothelial cells (ECs). The MEOX2 homeoprotein inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling and EC activation in response to serum and proangiogenic factors. We hypothesize that MEOX2 interacts with components of this pathway in vascular ECs to modulate NF-kappaB activity and EC activation and that these interactions depend upon specific domains within the MEOX2 protein.\nContext 5: The aim of this study is to determine whether or not hypoxia (2% O(2)) or reoxygenation (20% O(2)) affects mRNA expression and production of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), type I collagen, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The results of this study will be used to determine whether or not hypoxia or reoxygenation affects the production of these proteins by HUVECs in response to VEGF and/or bFGF.\nContext 6: The aim of this study is to determine whether or not hypoxia (2% O(2)) or reoxygenation (20% O(2)) affects mRNA expression and production of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), type I collagen, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We investigated the functional consequences of relieving ureteric obstruction in young pigs with experimental hydronephrosis (HN) induced by partial unilateral ureteropelvic obstruction.\nContext 2: Three groups of animals were followed from the age of 2 weeks to the age of 14 weeks: Eight animals had severe or grades 3-4 HN throughout the study. Six animals had relief of the obstruction after 4 weeks. Six animals received sham operations at both ages. Morphological and functional examinations were performed at age 6 weeks and again at age 14 weeks and consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), technetium-diethylenetriaminepentaaceticacid ((99m)Tc-DTPA) renography, renal technetium-dimercaptosuccinicacid ((99m)Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement.\nContext 3: After relief of the partial obstruction, there was reduction of the pelvic diameter and improvement of urinary drainage. Global and relative kidney function was not significantly affected by either obstruction or its relief. Renal (99m)Tc-DMSA scintigraphy showed a change in both the appearance of the kidney and a change in the distribution within kidneys even after relief of obstruction.\nContext 4: Nine-month-old female Ossabaw pigs were fed an excess calorie atherogenic diet to induce MetS. At 15 months of age, the MetS pigs were treated with 2000 SWs or an overtreatment dose of 4000 SWs targeted at the upper pole calyx of the left kidney (24\u2009kV at 120 SWs/min using the unmodified Dornier HM3 lithotripter; n=5-6 per treatment group). Serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were measured in conscious pigs before and \u223c60 days after SWL to provide a qualitative assessment of how well both kidneys were filtering (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]). Bilateral renal function was assessed at \u223c65 days post-SWL in anesthetized pigs with GFR and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) quantified by the renal clearance of inulin and para-amino hippurate, respectively.\nContext 5: The mechanism underlying the evolution of congenital obstructive hydronephrosis is still unclear. In a previous study, we have shown that it is possible to induce hydronephrosis in the neonatal period by partial ureteropelvic obstruction (UPO) in the pig. In this study, we investigated the functional consequences of relieving UPO in the neonatal period.\nContext 6: We investigated the functional consequences of relieving ureteric obstruction in young pigs with experimental hydronephrosis (HN) induced by partial unilateral ureteropelvic obstruction.\nContext 7: Three groups of animals were followed from the age of 2 weeks to the age of 14 weeks: Eight animals had severe or grades 3-4 HN throughout the study. Six animals had relief of the obstruction after 4 weeks. Six animals received sham operations at both ages. Morph", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Amongst school-aged children living in malaria endemic areas, chronic morbidity and exacerbation of morbidity associated with other infections are often not coincident with the presence or levels of Plasmodium parasitaemia, but may result from long-term exposure to the parasite. Studies of hepatosplenomegaly associated with Schistosoma mansoni infection and exposure to Plasmodium infection indicate that differences that occur over 1-2 km in levels of Plasmodium transmission are related to the degree of exacerbation of hepatosplenomegaly and that Plasmodium falciparum schizont antigen (Pfs)-IgG3 levels may be a marker for the differing levels of exposure.\nContext 2: One hundred and twenty one children were assessed at the Department of Child Health, KBTH from May to August 2008. ABO blood groups were determined by agglutination. The haemoglobin measurement was done with the haematology analyzer, Sysmex KX-21N. Malaria parasites were enumerated and the presence of malaria pigment noted. Identification of P. falciparum was done. Statistical tests used were odds ratio and chi square at a significance level of p<0.05.\nContext 3: A total of 20 children aged between 8 and 11 years and 20 adult males aged between 22 and 41 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled in the study. Mefloquine was administered to patients in both age groups at a dose of 20mgkg(-1). The steady-state drug concentrations were measured by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography.\nContext 4: Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among African children. Innate immunity provides the first line of defence against P. falciparum infections, particularly in young children that lack naturally-acquired malarial immunity, such as the population examined here. Consistent with the fact that elevated interleukin (IL)-12 is an important component of the innate immune response that provides protective immunity against malaria, we have previously shown that suppression of IL-12 in African children is associated with the development of severe malarial anaemia (SMA). Since the role of IL12B variants in conditioning susceptibility to SMA remains largely unexplored, the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (1188A\u2192C, rs3212227), SMA (p=0.0001) and IL-12B (p=0.0001) was investigated in a cohort of 1,000 children from the same population. The results showed that the C allele of rs3212227 was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of SMA (p=0.0001). The C allele was also associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of severe anaemia (p=0.0001). The C allele was also associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of severe anaemia (p=0.0001). The C allele was also associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of severe anaemia (p=0.0001).", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, a protective mechanism, minimizes perfusion of underventilated lung areas to reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatching. We studied the effects of sepsis on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and attempted to determine whether hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is influenced by pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate, a nitric oxide scavenger.\nContext 2: In the animals in group 1, left pulmonary blood flow decreased by 62 +/- 8 (SEM)% during left lung hypoxia and remained stable during repeated hypoxic challenges throughout the study period. After 24 hrs of sepsis, left pulmonary blood flow decreased from 56 +/- 10% to 26 +/- 2% (group 2) and from 50 +/- 8% to 23 +/- 6% (group 3). In the sheep in group 2, there was no adaptation over time. Pulmonary shunt fraction increased. Pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate had no effect on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction or pulmonary shunt. The animals receiving the bacterial infusion developed a hyperdynamic circulatory state with hypotension, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and increased cardiac output. Pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate increased mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance but did not influence cardiac index. Pulmonary arterial pressure was increased during sepsis and increased even further after pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate administration. Oxygenation and oxygen delivery and uptake were not affected by pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate.\nContext 3: All sheep were instrumented for chronic study. An ultrasonic flow probe was placed around the left pulmonary artery. After a 5-day recovery, a tracheostomy was performed and a double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed. Animals in groups 2 and 3 received a 48-hr infusion of live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 x 10(4) colony-forming units/kg/hr). After 24 hrs, sheep in group 3 received pyridoxalated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene conjugate (20 mg/kg/hr) for 16 hrs; sheep in groups 1 and 2 received only the vehicle. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was repeatedly tested by unilateral hypoxia of the left lung with 100% nitrogen. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction was assessed by the decrease in left pulmonary blood flow during hypoxia. Pulmonary shunt fraction was calculated as the difference between the left pulmonary blood flow and the left pulmonary artery flow during hypoxia. Oxygenation and oxygen delivery and uptake were measured by the use of a near-infrared spectroscopy system. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by the use of a pressure transducer and a flow probe. Pulmonary arterial pressure was measured by the use of a pressure transducer. Oxygenation and oxygen delivery and uptake were measured by the use of a near-infrared spectroscopy system. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by the use of a pressure transducer and a flow probe.

The triple therapy regimen eradicated infection from 19 of 20 SS1-infected mice. Mastic failed to eradicate infection from any of the 18 SS1-infected mice (P < 0.001) and there was no signifi- cant reduction in gastric bacterial load in mice treated with this regimen.\nContext 3: The susceptibility of H. pylori SS1 to mastic was assessed by broth dilution determination of the MIC and MBC. Mice were inoculated intragastrically with either a suspension of H. pylori SS1 (n = 70) or brain-heart infusion broth alone (n = 10). Mice were given antimicrobial chemotherapy 4 weeks after infection and were administered the mouse equivalent of either 2 g of mastic twice daily for 7 days or a triple therapy regimen containing the mouse equivalent of 400 mg of metronidazole, 250 mg of clarithromycin and 20 mg of omeprazole twice daily for 7 days. Mice were killed either immediately or 1 month after the completion of treatment, and their stomachs cultured for H. pylori.\nContext 4: The development of an effective vaccine against Helicobacter pylori is impeded by the inability to reliably produce sterilizing immunity and our lack of knowledge regarding mechanisms of protective immunity against this pathogen. It has previously been described that salivary glands are essential for vaccine-mediated protection against H.\u00a0pylori, but the mechanism responsible for this effect has not been identified. In this study we tested the hypothesis that vaccines reduce H.\u00a0pylori colonization by inducing an immune-mediated change in salivary gland mucin secretion.\nContext 5: One-week triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori revealed, during these last few years, a decrease in the eradication rate, so that the prolongation of its duration has been proposed. A sequential scheme recently showed very satisfactory results. We performed a prospective randomised study with the aim of either evaluating whether the triple therapy prolongation may improve its effectiveness and comparing its outcome with that of sequential regimen.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a rationale for your answer.\nThe answer should be 1-2 sentences long.\nThe answer should be in the form of a question.\nThe answer should be in the form of a statement.\nThe answer should be in the form of a sentence.\nThe answer should be in the form of a question.\nThe answer should be in the form of a statement.\nThe answer should be in the form of a sentence.\nThe answer should be in the form of a question.\nThe answer should be in the form of a statement.\nThe answer should be in the form of a sentence.\nThe answer should be in the form of a question.\nThe answer should be in the form of a statement.\nThe answer should be in the form of a sentence.\nThe answer", "Contexts:\nContext 1: From the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (1995-2013), we selected all adult liver transplant recipients with HCV, and cross-sectionally compared long-term graft loss and mortality rates between those who were transplanted from HCV antibody-positive (HCV+) vs. HCV antibody-negative donors.\nContext 2: Liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the main indication for liver transplantation (LT) among adults in the US. Recurrent HCV impairs patient and graft survival after LT. The high prevalence of HCV along with scarce organs has lead to increased utilization of HCV+ organs. We estimated the impact of HCV+ donors on patient and graft survival.\nContext 3: In this study, we analyzed 49 patients who underwent living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\nContext 4: Of 10,874 livers that were donated for transplantation, 7631 came from Caucasians, 1579 from AAs, 243 from APIs, and 1421 from others. After 36 months of follow-up evaluation, 2687 grafts failed. Without any adjustments, AA donors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.24), API donors (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12-1.77), and other donors (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.29) were associated with graft failure. After stratification by center and adjustments for age, height, and hepatitis B core antibody status of donors as well as serum creatinine and hepatitis C status of recipients, donor race was no longer statistically significant for AA (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.20) and API (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89-1.49) donors. However, livers donated from members of other race still had an increased risk of graft failure (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.35), although the effect was not uniform across donor-recipient pairs.\nContext 5: The use of HCV-positive livers for HCV-positive recipients is becoming more common.

The SIBDQ has been predominantly used in trials for Crohn's disease, and further validation of the SIBDQ is desirable in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. The primary objective was to further validate the SIBDQ by examining discriminant ability against measures of disease activity. The secondary objectives were to examine reliability and responsiveness to change.\nContext 2: All consecutive inflammatory bowel disease patients seen in the Department of Gastroenterology (Nancy, University Hospital, France) between April 2009 and July 2011 were interviewed for this cross-sectional study using a pre-established questionnaire. If the patient had at least one ocular symptom, he systematically underwent an ophthalmologic examination (visual acuity, Break-Up Time test, Schirmer Test, slit-lamp exam with fundus examination).\nContext 3: In a cross-sectional, postal HRQL survey, 116 patients with collagenous colitis at four Swedish hospitals completed four health-related quality of life questionnaires, two disease-specific (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Rating Form of IBD Patient Concerns), and two generic (Short Form 36, SF-36, and Psychological General Well-Being, PGWB), and a one-week symptom diary. Demographic and disease-related data were collected. Results for the collagenous colitis population were compared with a background population controlled for age and gender (n = 8931).\nContext 4: A significant majority of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) search the Internet for information about their disease. While patients who search the Internet for disease or treatment information are believed to be more resistant to accepting medical therapy, no studies have tested this hypothesis.\nContext 5: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32 pediatric ulcerative colitis cases undergoing colectomy from 2007 to 2014 for clinical data and precolectomy treatment history. The resected colon histology was reviewed independently by 2 blinded pathologists. The acute/active inflammation was scored using the modified Riley score for 3 colonic segments (proximal, transverse, and distal colon) for each patient. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate possible association between acute/active inflammation scores and the risk of postoperative complications.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the use of a new, more effective, and more convenient oral corticosteroid (OCS) formulation (Cortisporin) on the clinical course of pediatric Crohn's disease (CD). The study was conducted in a tertiary pediatric center in France. The study population consisted of 30 patients with CD who were treated with a 2-week course of oral corticosteroids (Cortisporin) and 30 patients who were treated with a 2-week course of oral corticosteroids (Cortisporin) and 30 patients who were treated with a 2-week course of oral", "Question: Does \u03b2-Resorcylidene aminoguanidine ( RAG ) dilate coronary arteries in an endothelium-independent manner??\nExplanation: RAG dilates coronary arteries at concentrations above 10(-5)mol/l. Inhibition of the endothelium-dependent mechanism of vasodilation by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, indomethacin and aminobenzotriazole did not affect RAG-mediated vasodilation. Other compounds also had no impact on the vasodilating effect of RAG: the NO-dependent guanylate cyclase inhibitor - 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3]quinoxalin-", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Dynamic and static complex scar contractures after burn commonly cause tendon adhesion, deep adipose tissue stiffness and further limitation of major joints motion. Skin autografting or locoregional flaps are not adequate reconstructive options, because of the easy recurrence and limitation of donor sites. Therefore, free perforator flaps are playing increasing role in reconstruction of complex scar contractures.\nContext 2: The free medial thigh perforator (MTP) flap is an addition to the reconstructive armamentarium and is particularly useful since the medial thigh is commonly spared in burn injury. Between December 2001 and October 2005, eight patients with severe post-burn scar contractures received free MTP flaps treatment in the Linkou Burn Center. The free MTP flap harvest was modified to enhance its reliability and versatility. Flap sizes ranged from 5 x 15 cm to 8 x 24 cm. The follow-up period was from 12 to 26 months. Flap harvest is rapid, averaging 37.8 min.\nContext 3: Complete flap viability was achieved in all the cases. We had one case of gapped wound which was managed only by dressing. Widening of the scar was found in 2 cases.\nContext 4: This study included 21 patients with scar contracture. Preoperatively, for marking the flaps, a zigzag line, the angles of which were kept in the range of 60-90\u00b0, was drawn over the contracture line. The incision was firstly made into the skin to avoid retraction of the flaps, and then deep through the fascia, making advancement of the V flap easy by sliding. The V flap was advanced along the long limb of the Y on the base of a subcutaneous pedicle. After meticulous hemostasis, all incisions were sutured.\nContext 5: Double opposing rectangular advancement is a new and alternative technique in the treatment of postburn scar contractures. The technique consists of opposing two adjacent subcutaneously pedicled rectangular flaps by advancement and lengthening a contracture band. Experimental studies demonstrated that the technique is efficient to elongate a tension line as much as Z-plasty in the rat inguinal skin. In this clinical study we investigated the efficiency and versatility of the technique in the treatment of wide linear postburn scar contractures in various parts of the body.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, or maybe.\n\nThe free medial thigh perforator (MTP) flap is an addition to the reconstructive armamentarium and is particularly useful since the medial thigh is commonly spared in burn injury.

In fetal or juvenile cartilage, PTN is an abundant protein and appears to be involved in chondrocyte differentiation. Since developmentally regulated factors often re-appear in the disease state, we examined PTN expression in cart", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Fenofibrate (FF) has been suggested as a second-line agent in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients who do not achieve adequate biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) monotherapy. Limited data exist on FF use beyond 12\u00a0months, and its long-term effects are unclear.\nContext 2: 103 patients (7.9%) were found to harbour OCBD and these were compared to 104 randomly selected control subjects. Compared to controls, OCBD patients were (i) significantly older (72 \u00b1 13 vs. 67 \u00b1 13, p<0.00001); (ii) more frequently underwent a cholecystectomy (p = 0.02) and biliary surgery (p = 0.003) prior to the diagnosis and (iii) more often developed chronic pancreatitis (p = 0.04) as well as biliary fistulae (p = 0.03). Prior to and after ERCP, OCBD subjects displayed significantly elevated cholestatic parameters and angle \u03b1 negatively correlated with common bile duct diameter (r = -0.29, p = 0.003). OCBD subjects more often required multiple back-to-back ERCP sessions to remove bile stones (p = 0.005) as well as more ERCPs later on due to recurrent stone formation (p<0.05).\nContext 3: Ninety-three patients, from whom intraoperative bile samples were collected after performing ERCP, were assigned to either an antibiotic-prophylaxis group (AP, n = 58) or a no-antibiotic-prophylaxis group (NAP, n = 35). Detection rates of biliary bacteria and antibiotic resistance were determined for each group. Multivariate analysis was also performed to identify risk factors for the development of drug-resistant biliary bacteria.\nContext 4: No consensus has yet been reached regarding the utility of antibiotic prophylaxis for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, there has been little discussion of potential adverse effects of antibiotic use. This study investigated the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on overall levels of bacterial infiltration of the biliary tract and the prevalence of drug-resistance among that population.\nContext 5: Patients with BA between 2001 and 2005 were reviewed. The use of steroids (4 mg/kg per day at alternate days for 1 to 3 months) has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of BA. However, the use of steroids in patients with BA is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in patients with BA.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in patients with BA.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in patients with BA.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in patients with BA.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in patients with BA.\nContext 10: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of steroids in patients with BA.\nContext 11", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Interpretation of baroreflex cardiovascular control requires accurate assessment of pulse pressure (PP) in central arteries under conditions of varying systemic or hydrostatic pressure. The objective of this study was to examine whether changes in PP during postural stress were similar in the peripheral versus carotid arteries.\nContext 2: Protocol A: Pulse pressures during Valsalva's manoeuvre were highly correlated between all devices (r = 0.6-0.8). Protocol B: compared with supine, PP was reduced in both the finger and wrist during head-up-tilt (HUT) (P<0.05), but not in the carotid artery.\nContext 3: Protocol A: Pulse pressure was measured in both the left (Millar tonometer) and right (Colin Pilot) radial arteries, and in the finger (Finapres) in seated subjects (n = 7) who performed Valsalva's manoeuvre. Protocol B: PP was measured from the carotid (Millar tonometer), and from the finger and wrist kept at the level of the carotid artery, during supine and 60 degrees head-up postures.\nContext 4: Carotid artery stiffness, an important determinant of arterial baroreflex sensitivity, varies considerably in healthy individuals, the source of which variability is not known. Tonic relaxant influence of the endothelium on vascular smooth muscle, reducing stiffness of the vessel wall, has been established in muscular conduit arteries. It is not known to what extent stiffness of the elastic carotid artery is under endothelial control.\nContext 5: Carotid sinus stimulation (with simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the blood pressure [BP] at the brachial artery) was performed in 90 newly diagnosed patients with stage I to II essential hypertension (aged 54 +/- 10 years; office BP, 154/97 mm Hg) and in 75 normotensive controls matched for age and sex. The cardioinhibitory type of CSStim responses was evaluated by calculating an index defined as the ratio of the longest R-R interval on the ECG recording during stimulation to R-R interval at rest. Common carotid artery (CCA) distensibility was calculated as a function of changes in diameter (determined by echocardiography) and pulse pressure (determined sphygmomanometrically at the brachial artery).\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that the carotid artery is a more sensitive baroreflex target than the radial artery. The carotid artery is also more sensitive to changes in BP than the radial artery. The carotid artery is more sensitive to changes in BP than the radial artery. The carotid artery is more sensitive to changes in BP than the radial artery. The carotid artery is more sensitive to changes in BP than the radial artery. The carotid artery is more sensitive to changes in BP than the radial artery. The carotid artery is more sensitive to changes in BP than the radial artery.

In this study, we attempted mutation analysis of the vhl gene, as well as detection of allelic loss at 3p25-26 in sporadic human breast cancer.\nContext 2: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene, is a hereditary tumor syndrome manifested by hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. In addition, a multitude of other rare tumors, including parasympathetic paragangliomas, can occur and even be the sole manifestation of VHL disease. The VHL gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene with biallelic inactivation contributing to tumor formation. However, in parasympathetic paragangliomas occurring in VHL disease, biallelic inactivation of the VHL gene has not been demonstrated to date.\nContext 3: Family cancer histories and constitutional DNA samples were obtained from 44 HD patients with SMNs identified. Using DNA-based sequencing, we evaluated the TP53 gene in all 44 patients. Nineteen female patients developing one or more secondary breast cancer were also analyzed for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer-susceptibility genes.\nContext 4: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene inactivation is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) development. The VHL protein (pVHL) has been proposed to regulate the expression of several proteins including Hypoxia Inducible Factor-\u03b1 (HIF-\u03b1), carbonic anhydrase (CA)IX, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 and osteopontin. pVHL has been characterized in vitro, however, clinical studies are limited. We evaluated the impact of VHL genetic alterations on the expression of several pVHL protein targets in paired normal and tumor tissue.\nContext 5: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene inactivation is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) development.

Resolution of erythema in both groups was assessed", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with increased risk of valvular degeneration and ascending aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. We sought to evaluate the roles of endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory activation in modulating these processes.\nContext 2: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac surgery cause an inflammatory response, as measurable by an increase in the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific inflammation marker. Previous publications have demonstrated typical perioperative CRP concentration profiles in cases of uncomplicated aortic valve replacement (AVR) with CPB. A regression analysis for modifying factors showed that chronic disease (heart failure, diabetes, and pulmonary disease), along with obesity and sex, all tend to influence the CRP response. We analyzed the inflammatory response to aortic valve implantation (AVI) with interventional techniques, mainly transapical but also transfemoral and transaxillary approaches, in a retrospective case-control study design.\nContext 3: Patients with BAV (n=43) and controls (n=25) were matched for age and gender. FMD was significantly lower in patients than controls (7.85\u00b13.48% vs 11.58\u00b13.98%, p=0.001), and these differences were age-independent. Within the BAV cohort, multivariate correlates of peak aortic valve velocity were plasma concentrations of ADMA and myeloperoxidase (MPO) (both p<0.01), while increasing age was an independent correlate of ascending aortic diameter (p<0.05). Furthermore, both low FMD and inflammatory activation were multivariate correlates of selectivity for valvular disease.\nContext 4: We performed a case-control study of patients with BAV together with a multivariate analysis within the BAV group to identify factors associated with: development of significant valvular disease; dilatation of the ascending aorta; differential valve relative to aortic disease. Endothelial function of patients and controls was evaluated via flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Correlations with inflammatory markers and endothelial progenitor cell counts were also examined. Morphological and physiological assessment of the valve and ascending aorta was performed with transthoracic echocardiography and MRI.\nContext 5: Sixty-four LDLR(-/-) mice were fed with high cholesterol diet to induce atherosclerosis. The mice were then randomized to receive either a low-dose (LD) or high-dose (HD) of atherogenic diet for 12 weeks. The HD group was further divided into two subgroups: one group received a low dose of atherogenic diet (LDH) and the other group received a high dose of atherogenic diet (HDH). The HDH group was further divided into two subgroups: one group received a low dose of atherogenic diet (LDH) and the other group received a high dose of atherogenic diet (HDH). The HDH group was further divided into two subgroups: one group received a low dose of atherogenic diet (LDH)", "Yes, method of aneurysm treatment affects clot clearance after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.", "No, weight gain during pregnancy does not influence the cephalad spread of sensory blockade after spinal anesthesia.\nExplanation: The authors found no correlation between weight gain during pregnancy and the cephalad spread of sensory blockade after spinal anesthesia. The authors used weight gain during pregnancy as a measure for the physique at term. The authors measured the susceptibility of individual spinal root axons to bupivacaine during late pregnancy in rats and compared them with similar measurements in nonpregnant rats. The authors found that the susceptibility of individual spinal root axons to bupivacaine was not influenced by weight gain during pregnancy. The authors concluded that weight gain during pregnancy does", "Question: Does a retrospective cohort study of implanted medical devices and selected chronic diseases in Medicare claim data??\nExplanation: The study was a retrospective cohort study of implanted medical devices and selected chronic diseases in Medicare claim data.

Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are widely used to treat hypertension, but most CCBs stimulate plasma renin activity (PRA) and increase plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), both of which are used in the screening for PA. The aim of this study was to determine whether the newly introduced CCB, azelnidipine, affects PRA and PAC.\nContext 2: Renin profiling has been proposed as a method to guide antihypertensive drug selection. This prespecified post-hoc analysis examined the influence of baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) on blood pressure (BP) responses.\nContext 3: Essential hypertension (EHT), RVH and PA patients were hospitalized and maintained on a standard diet (NaCl 10 g/day). The patients underwent a captopril (25 mg) loading test. A renin-secretion stimulating test (furosemide 1 mg/kg, i.v. +2 h of walking) and an ACTH loading test were performed for the PA patients. The plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and plasma AM and PAMP levels were monitored before and after the loadings.\nContext 4: Azelnidipine treatment in drug-na\u00efve (DN) cases significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). PRA and PAC in the DN group on azelnidipine treatment were indistinguishable from those in the DN group before treatment. Compared with other CCB treatments such as amlodipine, manidipine and slow-release nifedipine, azelnidipine showed comparable or significant reductions in SBP, DBP and HR. In patients who were switched from other CCBs to azelnidipine, PRA and PAC were decreased, except for PAC on amlodipine treatment. Since the PRA reduction rate exceeded that of PAC, the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) was significantly increased in those on azelnidipine treatment who had been switched from manidipine or nifedipine treatment, suggesting the restoration of possibly underestimated ARR values.\nContext 5: Data from multiple clinical trials have provided good evidence about the benefit of CCBs in the treatment of hypertension. However, the mechanism of action of CCBs is not fully understood. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of azelnidipine on PRA and PAC in patients with hypertension.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of azelnidipine on plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in patients with essential hypertension (EHT).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of azelnidipine on plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) in patients with essential hypertension (EHT).\nContext 8: The aim of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) is a relatively rare but often overlooked autoimmune neurological disorder that targets antigens within the brain's inhibitory pathways resulting in incapacitating stiffness and spasms that impact on the patients' quality of life. Although a number of immunomodulating therapies significantly improve the patients' symptoms, the exact pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear.\nContext 2: A total of 165 patients were identified. 52 patients had been treated with either immunomodulator or biological agent. Of 20 histological features examined, only muscular hypertrophy approached significance (P = 0.05), Montreal A and Montreal L phenotypes were the same regardless on immunomodulators, however, there was a significant difference (P = 0.03) with regard to Montreal B in patients with stricturing disease being more likely to have received an immunomodulator.\nContext 3: Mutations in TPM3, encoding Tpm3.12, cause a clinically and histopathologically diverse group of myopathies characterized by muscle weakness. We report two patients with novel de novo Tpm3.12 single glutamic acid deletions at positions \u0394E218 and \u0394E224, resulting in a significant hypercontractile phenotype with congenital muscle stiffness, rather than weakness, and respiratory failure in one patient.\nContext 4: Spondyloarthritis (SpA), an interrelated group of rheumatic diseases, has been suggested to be triggered by bacterial infections prior to the development of an autoimmune response that causes inflammation of the spinal and peripheral joints. Because human heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), recently renamed HSPD1, and bacterial HSP60 are highly homologous, immunological cross-reactivity has been proposed as a mechanism of disease initiation. However, previous investigations of the humoral immune response to HSP60 in SpA patients have lacked determination of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses and patient follow-up. In this study, we have focused on these parameters in a cohort of axial SpA patients with a well-established set of clinical characteristics, including MRI changes and human leukocyte antigen B27.\nContext 5: CsA treatment for 14 days led to increased transforming growth factor-beta transcript levels and collagen III deposition in the postischemic kidney. However, neither the total number of alpha-smooth-muscle-actin-positive interstitial myofibroblasts, nor the bone marrow-derived fraction thereof was affected by CsA. These results suggest that CsA treatment does not affect the number of myofibroblasts in the kidney, but rather the number of myofibroblasts in the bone marrow.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a 3-month treatment with the immunomodulator cyclosporine A (CsA) on the expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The SF was collected from 20 patients with RA before and after 3 months of CsA treatment.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Rat allograft donors and recipients were treated with a single-dose of simvastatin 2h prior to allograft procurement and reperfusion, respectively. Intragraft caspase-3, -8, and -9 and RIPK1 and -3 mRNA expression was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR and protein activity measured by immunohistochemistry and luminescent assays 6h after reperfusion. Lactate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were analysed from allograft recipient and from hypoxic endothelial cell cultures having treated with activated simvastatin.\nContext 2: When compared to without cold ischemia, prolonged 4-hour cold ischemia significantly enhanced intragraft mRNA expression of caspase-3 and -9, and RIPK1 and -3, and elevated protein activity of caspase-9 and RIPK1 in the allografts. Simvastatin pretreatment decreased mRNA expression of caspase-3 and -9, and RIPK1 and -3 and protein activity of caspase-9 and RIPK1 in the allografts. Intragraft caspase-8 mRNA expression remained constant regardless of cold ischemia or simvastatin pretreatment. Simvastatin pretreatment attenuated lactate and LDH levels, both in the allograft recipients and in hypoxic endothelial cell cultures.\nContext 3: In transplantation-associated ischemia/reperfusion injury (Tx-IRI), tumor necrosis factor alpha and damage-associated molecular patterns promote caspase-8 and -9 apoptotic and receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 and -3 (RIPK1/3) necroptotic pathway activation. The extent of cell death and the counterbalance between apoptosis and regulated necrosis eventually determine the immune response of the allograft. Although simvastatin prevents Tx-IRI, its role in apoptotic and necroptotic activity remains unsolved.\nContext 4: We used a recently described specific activator of AKT, the small molecule SC79, to treat rat hearts submitted to ischemia and reperfusion. Initially, isolated rat hearts were perfused with increasing doses of SC79 to verify the magnitude of AKT activation. Low and high doses were determined and used to treat hearts submitted to ischemia (35\u00a0minutes) and reperfusion (60\u00a0minutes), in a randomized and blinded manner. Hearts were harvested at 6, 12, 24, and 48\u00a0hours after reperfusion. Caspase-3, -8, and -9, and RIPK1 and -3 mRNA expression was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR and protein activity measured by immunohistochemistry and luminescent assays. Lactate and LDH levels were analysed from allograft recipient and from hypoxic endothelial cell cultures having treated with activated SC79.\nContext 5: SC79 pretreatment significantly decreased caspase-3, -8, and -9, and RIPK1 and -3 mRNA expression and protein activity in the allografts. SC79 pretreatment significantly decreased lactate and LD", "Question: Does prehospital oral chlorhexidine reduce the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia among critically ill trauma patients : A prospective concurrent-control study??\nExplanation: The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that prehospital oral chlorhexidine administered to intubated trauma patients will decrease the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) during the first 2 days of hospitalization.\nThe study was conducted at a Level I trauma center. The study was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. The study was conducted in a 711-bed Midwestern academic trauma center. Patients were transported by air ambulance to the hospital. Patients were randomized to receive either prehospital oral chlorhexidine or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in CP", "Question: Does previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair adversely affect the functional or oncological outcomes of endoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy??\nExplanation: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of incisional hernias after elective open colorectal resection versus laparoscopic colorectal resection.\nPatients with a primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized either to the TIPP (PolySoft mesh) or to repair with a ProGrip mesh. Primary objective was the occurrence of chronic pain after surgery. Secondary objectives were, i.e., recurrences, complications, and quality of life. Follow-up occurred after 2\u00a0weeks, 3\u00a0months, and 1\u00a0year. Patients", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Smooth muscle fibers can be stimulated with an electrical field, high potassium or carbachol. We studied the effect of combined, supramaximal stimulation on the isometric force and the maximum shortening velocity of the pig urinary bladder.\nContext 2: We infused 0.3% and 1.5% H(2)O(2) to the urinary bladder to evaluate the voiding function and frequency, pelvic afferent (PANA) and pelvic efferent nerve activity (PENA) simultaneously in the urethane anesthetized rats. We measured ATP and acetylcholine content in the rat urinary bladder under saline or H(2)O(2) stimulation. Hyaluronic acid, muscarinic, and purinergic receptor antagonists were used to evaluate their effects and mechanisms on H(2)O(2)-induced hyperactive bladder.\nContext 3: An in vivo rat bladder model was used to monitor for release of substances capable of inducing smooth muscle contractions. Purified PSA, seminal vesicle fluid (SVF) from radical prostatectomy specimens, bradykinin, saline and a bradykinin antagonist were injected intravesically into urethane-anesthetized rats, and the resulting bladder contractions were measured.\nContext 4: Detrusor overactivity and bladder volumes at first sensation of bladder filling, first desire to void, and strong desire to void during filling cystometry were compared between 55 female patients with OAB and 42 with non-OAB. CPT measurements from the bladder mucosa taken after neuroselective electrostimulation at frequencies of 2000, 250, and 5 Hz were compared between the 2 groups. In OAB patients, the correlations between CPT values and voiding variables based on 3-day bladder diaries were investigated.\nContext 5: Injection of either PSA or SVF alone did not induce bladder contractions. Injection of a mixture of SVF and PSA preincubated 15 minutes, however, induced strong bladder contractions (23 +/- 7 cm. H2O) that decreased with time (4 +/- 2 cm. H2O, after 90 minutes). Similar contractions were observed after injection of bradykinin (10(-4) M. = 39 +/- 14, 10(-6) M. = 27 +/- 9, 10(-8) M. = 7 +/- 3 cm. H2O). Bradykinin-induced contractions were blocked by the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist HOE 140 (10(-6) M. = 0 +/- 0, 10(-7) M. = 0 +/- 0, 10(-8) M. = 0 +/- 0 cm. H2O). Bradykinin-induced contractions were also blocked by the bradykinin B(1) receptor antagonist HOE 140 (10(-6) M. = 0 +/- 0, 10(-7) M. = 0 +/- 0, 10(-8) M. = 0 +/- 0 cm. H2O).", "Question: Does lumbar multifidus muscle thickness predict patients with low back pain who improve with trunk stabilization exercises??\nExplanation: Lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle thickness is a clinical feature of low back pain (LBP) and is associated with pain and disability. The purpose of this study was to determine whether LM muscle thickness predicts functional status or back pain at 6- or 12-month follow-up in older adults with spinal degeneration. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the cross-sectional area (CSA) of lumbar muscles predict functional status or back pain at 6- or 12-month follow-up in older adults with spinal degeneration. The secondary objective is to evaluate whether these muscle characteristics improve", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Predicting extubation failure (EF) is one of the most challenging aspects of critical care medicine. The literature on EF in neurocritical care patients is very scarce. We sought to determine the ability of traditional weaning parameters to predict EF in neurocritical patients.\nContext 2: This is a retrospective observational study performed at a tertiary level, academic, Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NCCU). We included all adult patients intubated for neurological reasons in whom an attempt to perform extubation was performed. We compared traditional weaning parameters between patients who failed extubation and those successfully extubated. Fishers exact test was used for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. Weaning parameters were analyzed as categorical variables and when appropriate as continuous. We incorporated a coma scale (Four Score) in an attempt to determine if neurologic dysfunction could account for EF.\nContext 3: Twenty-seven (23.7%) of 119 PMV subjects required reintubation within 7 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the only variable associated with extubation failure was ineffective cough (P <.001). Possessing 2 or more acceptable weaning parameters was not helpful in predicting extubation outcome. Subjects with failed extubation had worse 1-year survival (hazard ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.87, P =.02) compared with those with successful extubation.\nContext 4: From 2005 to 2007, intubated patients who were admitted to the intermediate respiratory care unit, had been on mechanical ventilation for \u2265 21 days at the time of admission, and underwent extubation after successful spontaneous breathing trials were included. Comparisons between subjects with successful extubation and failed extubation in terms of weaning parameters and clinical predictors of extubation outcome were performed. Also, 1-year survival of subjects with regard to extubation outcome was analyzed.\nContext 5: The study sample compromised 62 patients undergoing extubation trial. None of the individual weaning parameters predicted EF: rapid shallow breathing index (P = 0.62), minute ventilation (P = 0.7479), respiratory rate (P = 1.0), negative inspiratory force (P = 0.62), tidal volume, and PaO2/FIO2 ratio (P = 1.0). There was no significant difference in Four Scale score between the two groups (P = 0.12). The 1-year survival rate was 100% in the successful extubation group and 50% in the failed extubation group (P = 0.02).\nContext 6: Weaning parameters were analyzed as categorical variables and when appropriate as continuous. We incorporated a coma scale (Four Score) in an attempt to determine if neurologic dysfunction could account for EF. Weaning parameters were analyzed as categorical variables and when appropriate as continuous.

Extracellular superoxide was measured using cytochrome c reduction.\nContext 3: Angiotensin II (Ang II) contributes to vascular pathology in part by stimulating NADPH oxidase activity, leading to increased formation of superoxide (O2-). We reported that O2- levels, NADPH oxidase activity, and expression of the p47phox subunit of NADPH oxidase are increased in human abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Here, we tested the hypothesis that deletion of p47phox will attenuate oxidative stress and AAA formation in Ang II-infused apoE-/- mice.\nContext 4: Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) by angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases. NADPH oxidase is a major source of superoxide generated in vascular tissues. Although Nox1 has been identified in vascular smooth muscle cells as a new homolog of gp91phox (Nox2), a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, the pathophysiological function of Nox1-derived ROSs has not been fully elucidated. To clarify the role of Nox1 in Ang II-mediated hypertension, we generated Nox1-deficient (-/Y) mice.\nContext 5: Changes in isometric tension showed that the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations in renal arteries of hypertensive patients were enhanced by 12 h in vitro treatment with calcitriol. Dihydroethidium fluorescence revealed an elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in these arteries which was reduced by calcitriol. Immunofluorescence showed that calcitriol treatment reduced the expression of AT(1)R, NOX-2, NOX-4, and p67(phox) and increased that of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in renal arteries. These results suggest that calcitriol may reduce the oxidative stress in renal arteries and attenuate the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations in hypertensive patients.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) and the activity of NOX in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The results showed that the expression of NOX-1, NOX-2, and NOX-4 was significantly increased in the aorta of SHR compared with that of WKY rats.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To examine the role of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in thrombopoiesis.\nContext 2: Thrombopoietin-unresponsi ve mice (mpl null mice), which have a profound reduction in platelets and mature megakaryocytes, were interbred with mice that do not respond to GM-CSF or interleukin 5 (betac null mice), and hematopoiesis was examined. In initial experiments on a mixed genetic background, double mutant mice (betac/mpl null mice) showed an unexpected amelioration of the thrombocytopenia seen in mpl null mice. Platelet counts were elevated approximately twofold in betac/mpl null mice compared with mpl null mice (mpl null 73+/-31; betac/mpl null 164+/-70; n = 10 to 29 mice per genotype, p<0.00001). This was associated with lessening of the deficit of megakaryocytes, progenitor cells, and colony-forming units spleen seen in mpl null mice. This amelioration of the mpl null phenotype in betac/mpl null mice on a mixed genetic background was highly statistically significant. To determine whether this amelioration of phenotype was solely the consequence of loss of betac signaling, progeny of a second intercross on a C57BL/6 background (B6betac/mpl null mice) were examined. When the resulting B6betac/mpl null mice were analyzed and compared with B6mpl null littermates, the increase in platelet count, hematopoietic progenitor cell number, and colony-forming units spleen number was no longer observed.\nContext 3: To test this hypothesis we transplanted c-mpl-null and wild-type (WT) control mice with WT marrow stem cells, resulting in two groups of posttransplant chimeric animals, one expressing c-mpl on megakaryocytes and platelets only and one in which the receptor is expressed on both hematopoietic and ECs. Should EC c-mpl take up TPO and degrade it, we predicted that c-mpl-null mice reconstituted with WT cells would display increased TPO levels and an increased steady state platelet count compared to the WT recipients.\nContext 4: The distinction between clonal and reactive thrombocytoses is a frequent problem and implies different therapeutic options. As a first step, we examined the kinetics of platelet production in c-mpl-null mice and found that the steady state platelet count was elevated in c-mpl-null mice compared to WT mice. This was associated with a 2-fold increase in the number of megakaryocytes and a 2-fold increase in the number of colony-forming units spleen. The increase in megakaryocytes and colony-forming units spleen was associated with a 2-fold increase in the number of progenitor cells in the bone marrow. The increase in the number of progenitor cells was associated with a 2-fold increase in the number of colony-forming units spleen. The increase in the number of progenitor cells was associated with a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We tested whether sphingosine kinase (Sphk1) that generates the endogenous sphingolipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is part of a signaling cascade to activate the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. Using a new transfection model, we report that resting tone and myogenic responses of isolated resistance arteries increased with forced expression of Sphk1 in smooth muscle cells of these arteries. Overexpression of a dominant negative Sphk1 mutant or coexpression of dominant negative mutants of RhoA or Rho kinase together with Sphk1 completely inhibited development of tone and myogenic responses.\nContext 2: RhoA and Rho kinase are important modulators of microvascular tone.\nContext 3: Earlier we have shown that extracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induces migration of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) through the activation of S1P(1) receptor, PKC\u03b5, and PLD2-PKC\u03b6-Rac1 signaling cascade. As endothelial cells generate intracellular S1P, here we have investigated the role of sphingosine kinases (SphKs) and S1P lyase (S1PL), that regulate intracellular S1P accumulation, in HPAEC motility.\nContext 4: Rat aortic rings were denuded of endothelium, mounted in organ baths, and subjected to contraction or relaxation. Phosphorylation of 20kDa myosin light chains (MLC(20) ), myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) and protein kinase C (PKC)-potentiated inhibitory protein for heterotrimeric myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) of 17kDa (CPI17) were examined by immunoblot. We also measured the amount of guanosine triphosphate RhoA as a marker for RhoA activation.\nContext 5: Rho kinase plays an important role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) contraction and other cellular functions, such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that long-term inhibition of Rho kinase suppresses coronary artery spasm and vascular lesion formation after arterial injury. In the cardiovascular surgery field, intimal thickening in vein grafts is the major cause of late graft failure, for which no effective treatment is available. We have investigated the role of Rho kinase in vein graft intimal thickening.\nContext 6: Rho kinase (ROCK) is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by RhoA and is involved in the regulation of cell motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. ROCK is activated by phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK1/ROCK2), by RhoA. ROCK1/ROCK2 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. ROCK1/ROCK2 is activated by phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit, Rho-associated protein kinase", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) is the second most frequent primary malignant liver tumor following hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a highly fatal disease and has few therapeutics. The CXC chemokine ligand-12 (CXCL12)/CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) axis has been shown to be involved in tumorgenesis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in a variety of cancers including IHCC. However, its prognostic significance in IHCC is unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the functional role of CXCR4 in the progression and metastasis of IHCC and explore the underlying mechanism.\nContext 2: CXCL12 exerts a wide variety of chemotactic effects on cells. Evidence indicates that CXCL12, in conjunction with its receptor, CXCR4, promotes invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Our objective was to explore whether the CXCL12-CXCR4 biological axis might influence biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells.\nContext 3: We demonstrated that CXCR4 expression was closely correlated with IHCC progression and metastasis characteristics. The overall survival of patients with high CXCR4 expression was significantly lower than that of patients with low CXCR4 expression. Furthermore, we showed that the abrogation of CXCR4 had significantly negative influence on the IHCC cell phenotype, including in vitro cell proliferation, cell cycle, colony formation, cell invasion, and in vivo tumorigenicity. In addition, CXCR4 knockdown downregulated Wnt target genes and mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin and Slug.\nContext 4: The mechanisms mediating hepatic accumulation of inflammatory cells in cholestatic liver disease remain enigmatic. Our thesis is that Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation promotes hepatic accumulation of immune cells that interact with cholangiocytes. We believe that myofibroblastic hepatic stellate cells (MF-HSCs) release soluble Hh ligands that stimulate cholangiocytes to express chemokines that recruit mononuclear cell types with cognate receptors for these chemokines, thereby orchestrating a repair-related mechanism for liver inflammation. To address this thesis, we used three experimental systems that allow the definition of Hh-dependent mechanisms that induce phenotypic changes in cholangiocytes. First, cholangiocytes were cultured alone or in the presence of Hh-producing MF-HSCs in the absence or presence of a chemokine. Second, cholangiocytes were cultured in the presence of Hh-producing MF-HSCs in the presence or absence of a chemokine. Third, cholangiocytes were cultured in the presence of Hh-producing MF-HSCs in the presence or absence of a chemokine and then exposed to a chemokine. We found that Hh-producing MF-HSCs induced cholangiocyte chemokine expression and that this chemokine expression was dependent on Hh signaling. We also found that Hh-producing MF-HSCs induced cholangiocyte chemokine expression and that this chemokine expression was dependent on Hh signaling. We also found that H", "No, the -1154G/A polymorphism of the VEGF gene is not associated with a higher risk of cerebral infarction.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Visceral hypersensitivity to distension is thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Cannabinoids are known to decrease somatic pain perception, but their effect on visceral sensitivity in IBS remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the mixed CB(1) /CB(2) receptor agonist delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394(9) -THC, dronabinol) on rectal sensitivity.\nContext 2: Cannabinoid receptors are located on cholinergic neurons. Genetic variants that affect endocannabinoid metabolism are associated with colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhea. We compared the effects of dronabinol, a nonselective agonist of the cannabinoid receptor, with those of placebo on colonic motility and sensation in patients with IBS, and examined the effects of IBS subtype and specific genetic variants in cannabinoid mechanisms.\nContext 3: All participants (HV and IBS) reported central side effects during the highest dose of \u0394(9) -THC, most frequently increased awareness of the surrounding, light-headedness and sleepiness, whereas no side effects where reported during placebo. Although blood pressure was not affected, heart rate increased in both HV and IBS, but was most pronounced in IBS patients. The cannabinoid agonist \u0394(9) -THC did not alter baseline rectal perception to distension compared to placebo in HV or IBS patients. Similarly, after sigmoid stimulation there were no significant differences between placebo and \u0394(9) -THC in sensory thresholds of discomfort.\nContext 4: Ten IBS patients and 12 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent a barostat study to assess rectal sensitivity using an intermittent pressure-controlled distension protocol before and after sigmoid stimulation. Repetitive sigmoid stimulation is a validated method to increase visceral perception in IBS patients, consisting of a 10-min period of 30 s stimuli (60 mmHg), separated by 30 s of rest (5 mmHg). The effect of placebo and \u0394(9) -THC (5 and 10 mg in healthy volunteers and 10 mg in IBS patients) on rectal sensitivity was evaluated on respectively three and two separate days in a double blind, randomized, crossover fashion.\nContext 5: Delta-9-atetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychoactive component of cannabis. It is a potent agonist of the CB(1) cannabinoid receptor and a partial agonist of the CB(2) cannabinoid receptor. The CB(1) receptor is expressed on cholinergic neurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and is involved in the regulation of colonic motility. The CB(2) receptor is expressed on sensory neurons in the ENS and is involved in the regulation of visceral perception. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of THC on colonic motility and sensation in patients with IBS and healthy volunteers.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the cannabinoid receptor agonist \u0394(9) -", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim was to investigate whether infection with the nematode parasite Trichuris suis alters systemic cytokine levels, cellular cytokine responses to parasite antigens and pollen allergens and/or the cytokine profile of allergic individuals.\nContext 2: In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial (UMIN trial registry, Registration no. R000001298, Trial ID UMIN000001070, URL: http://www.umin.ac.jp/map/english), adults with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis received three weekly doses of 2500 Trichuris suis ova (n\u00a0=\u00a045) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a044) over 6\u00a0months. IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 were quantified via cytometric bead array in plasma. Cytokines, including active TGF-\u03b2, were also quantified in supernatants from peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured with parasite antigens or pollen allergens before, during and after the grass pollen season for a sub-cohort of randomized participants (T. suis ova-treated, n\u00a0=\u00a012, Placebo-treated, n\u00a0=\u00a010).\nContext 3: Helminth infection induced a Th2-polarized cytokine response comprising elevated plasma IL-5 and parasite-specific IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, and a global shift in the profile of systemic cytokine responses. Infection also elicited high levels of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 in response to T. suis antigens. Despite increased production of T. suis-specific cytokines in T. suis ova-treated participants, allergen-specific cytokine responses during the grass pollen season and the global profile of PBMC cytokine responses were not affected by T. suis ova treatment.\nContext 4: Parasitic helminths have been shown to reduce inflammation in most experimental models of allergic disease, and this effect is mediated via cytokine responses. However, in humans, the effects of controlled helminth infection on cytokine responses during allergy have not been studied.\nContext 5: In patients polysensitized to pollen allergens, the priming effect, by which the sensitivity of the nasal mucosa to an allergen is increased by the previous exposure to another allergen, is a known phenomenon. This study was aimed at evaluating the degree of nasal inflammation, assessed by nasal cytology, in patients with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis who were treated with Trichuris suis ova.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate whether infection with the nematode parasite Trichuris suis alters systemic cytokine levels, cellular cytokine responses to parasite antigens and pollen allergens and/or the cytokine profile of allergic individuals.\nContext 7: In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial (UMIN trial registry, Registration no.

However, in our recent study of an OR scheduling office, cancellations (slightly) reduced variability in workload among days. If a relatively low incidence of cancellations does not cause increased variability in workload, this would be a useful finding when focusing strategic OR management initiatives. However, the previous study considered only the effect on the schedule for the day the cancelled case originally was scheduled to be performed, not the future date on which the case was performed.\nContext 2: From 7:00 am the working day before surgery through the day of surgery, 9.7% \u00b1 0.6% of scheduled OR hours and 9.7% \u00b1 0.5% of cases were cancelled. Among cases performed, 9.5% \u00b1 0.5% of the scheduled hours and 9.5% \u00b1 0.5% of the cases were previously cancelled (i.e., rescheduled to a later date and then performed). Surgeons' median workloads on days with at least 1 case were 8.3 \u00b1 0.2 hours. The percentage of scheduled workload attributable to rescheduled cases was slightly less on days when the surgeon had larger than median workloads (-0.7% \u00b1 0.3%, P = 0.022).\nContext 3: For 90% of cancelled cases, the patient later underwent the same or a similar procedure at the studied hospital. Thus, the OR schedule at 7:00 am each day over 2 years could be used to study case rescheduling. The primary end point, calculated for each surgeon, was the difference of 2 ratios. The first ratio was the proportion of scheduled workload attributable to previously cancelled cases, among all days for which the surgeon's workload exceeded the surgeon's median workload. The second ratio was that proportion among the other days when the surgeon performed at least 1 case. Means \u00b1 SEMs were calculated by random effects analysis, stratified by surgeon.\nContext 4: Many surgical suites allocate operating room (OR) block time to individual surgeons. If block time is allocated to services/groups and yet the same surgeon invariably operates on the same weekday, for all practical purposes block time is being allocated to individual surgeons. Organizational conflict occurs when a surgeon with a relatively low OR utilization has a block time that is allocated to a group of surgeons with a relatively high OR utilization. This organizational conflict is likely to occur when the surgeon's OR utilization is relatively low and the group of surgeons with high OR utilization has a relatively high block time. The study of the effect of block time allocation on OR utilization is complicated by the fact that block time is allocated to groups of surgeons, not to individual surgeons. The study of block time allocation on OR utilization is complicated by the fact that block time is allocated to groups of surgeons, not to individual surgeons.

Mutations in genes of the MMR are a predisposition to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). In women, MMR gene mutations may lead to primary endometrial cancer (EC). The important function of the MMR for the integrity of the DNA during replication makes it probable that the MMR might also be involved in the development and the course of sporadic carcinomas. Insufficient MMR activity or expression levels could be prognostic markers of the disease.\nContext 2: Tissue microarrays representing 612 ovarian carcinomas were tested for mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) by immunohistochemistry. dMMR was detected in 13.8% of endometrioid and 2.4% of clear cell carcinomas, but not in other histological types. Within endometrioid carcinomas, 11 of 25 dMMR cases showed abnormal MLH1/PMS2, 10 cases showed abnormal MSH2/MSH6, and four cases showed only abnormal MSH6, indicating that at least 7.7% of endometrioid carcinomas have dMMR probably related to Lynch syndrome. The four dMMR clear cell carcinomas showed abnormal MSH2/MSH6 in three cases and only abnormal MSH6 in one case, all probably related to Lynch syndrome. Within endometrioid carcinomas, dMMR was significantly associated with age <50 years, synchronous endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, a higher CA125 level at diagnosis, higher FIGO grade, absence of ARID1A, and at least 20 CD8-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes per high-power field, but was not associated with cancer-specific death. Age <50 years, higher CA125 levels at diagnosis and at least 20 CD8-positive intraepithelial lymphocytes per high-power field remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing, but their sensitivity for identifying dMMR remained insufficient.\nContext 3: Compared to known tumor markers, namely estrogen and progesterone receptors, histopathological grading, TNM stage and FIGO classification, no significant correlation between MSH2 immunoreactivity and EC was found.\nContext 4: Immunohistochemical analysis of MSH2 expression in 100 ovarian carcinomas revealed that 10% of tumors were positive for MSH2. The expression of MSH2 was significantly associated with the presence of a high-grade tumor, a high CA125 level at diagnosis, and a high FIGO grade. The expression of MSH2 was not associated with the presence of a synchronous endometrial carcinoma, the presence of a lymph node metastasis, or the presence of a high tumor stage. The expression of MSH2 was not associated with the presence of a high tumor grade, a high CA125 level at diagnosis, or a high FIGO grade. The expression of MSH2 was not associated with the presence of a synchronous endometrial carcinoma, the presence of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To bring further insight into the mechanism of cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hepatotoxicity, the acute effect of CsA on local hepatic blood flow (LHBF) and its association with systemic hemodynamics, histopathological and biochemical indicators of liver toxicity were studied in guinea pigs in vivo. The association of endothelin (ET) and/or Cremophor-EL (C-EL, vehicle in parenteral CsA preparation) with CsA effects was also investigated.\nContext 2: Plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels are increased in patients with cirrhosis and ET-1 production is increased in the liver itself during experimental injury. These data suggest a possible role for this vasoactive peptide in intrahepatic microcirculatory changes that contribute to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Therefore the aims of this study were to determine whether ET-1 levels were abnormal in the livers of patients with cirrhosis and to investigate possible clinical correlates of altered hepatic ET-1 in cirrhosis.\nContext 3: Plasma endothelin levels were significantly higher in cirrhotic rats with ascites (24.5 +/- 2.8 pg/mL; P < 0.001) than in cirrhotic rats without ascites and control rats (7.9 +/- 2.0 and 5.8 +/- 0.9 pg/mL, respectively). In animals with ascites, endothelin and endothelin 1 mRNA content in the lung, kidney, and aorta was similar to that of the controls. In contrast, higher endothelin content (0.567 +/- 0.217 vs. 0.045 +/- 0.002 pg/mg protein; P < 0.05) and endothelin 1 mRNA was observed in hepatic tissue of rats with cirrhosis and ascites. Endothelin A receptor blockade was not associated with significant changes in arterial and portal pressure in any group of animals.\nContext 4: Plasma endothelin was measured in control rats and cirrhotic rats with and without ascites. In addition, the tissue concentration of endothelin and endothelin 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and the effect of an endothelin A receptor antagonist on arterial and portal pressure were assessed in cirrhotic rats with ascites and control rats.\nContext 5: Elevation of serum total homocysteine (tHcy) levels is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tHcy on endothelin-1 (ET-1) production in human endothelial cells (ECs) and to determine whether tHcy affects ET-1 production in vivo in a rat model of cirrhosis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tHcy on ET-1 production in human ECs and to determine whether tHcy affects ET-1 production in vivo in a rat model of cirrhosis.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tHcy on ET-1 production in human ECs and to determine whether tH", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between clinical pregnancy and serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, assessed after 14 days of endometrial preparation with estradiol (E(2)) in the absence of pituitary suppression during a frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FRET) cycle.\nContext 2: The frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles (FET) that use the letrozole stimulation protocols for endometrial preparation were divided into two groups according the different method of triggering final oocyte maturation. The serum LH and E2 levels, and the endometrial thickness on the day of triggering, the clinical pregnancy rates, the miscarriage rates and live birth rates were compared.\nContext 3: Using a previously described breakpoint in serum P concentration of 0.9 ng/mL (2.86 nmol/L), 8 of 69 (11.6%) frozen ETs in which embryos from low P level IVF cycles were transferred and 7 of 27 (25.9%) frozen ETs of embryos from elevated P level IVF cycles were transferred resulted in the development of clinical pregnancies. Although this does not clearly demonstrate superiority of embryos obtained from elevated P cycles, employing a power calculation, the probability that the pregnancy rate in the elevated serum P group is at least equal to the observed rate in the low P group is 92.8%.\nContext 4: In this retrospective study the data of 651 frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles were assessed over a 36-months period. Our patients were categorized according to storage time of freeze. Group I: less than 90 days, Group II: between 90-365 days. Group III: between 365-730 days. Group IV: between 730-1095 days. Group V: more than 1095 days. Clinical pregnancy and implantation rate were defined and statistical analysis was performed using Student t-test and Chi-square.\nContext 5: Triggering ovulation by GnRH agonist (GnRHa) in GnRH antagonist IVF protocols coupled with adequate luteal phase support has recently been suggested as a means to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Our objective was to examine the outcome of fresh embryo transfer (f-ET) after triggering ovulation by GnRHa and providing intensive luteal phase supplementation, compared with that of the next first frozen-thawed embryo transfer (ft-ET) after cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with GnRH agonist.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GnRH agonist (GnRHa) on the outcome of fresh embryo transfer (f-ET) after triggering ovulation by GnRHa and providing intensive luteal phase support, compared with that of the next first frozen-thawed embryo transfer (ft-ET) after cycles of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) with GnRH agonist.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GnRH agonist (GnRHa) on the outcome of fresh embryo transfer (f-ET) after triggering ovulation by GnR", "Question: Is a rice-based traditional dietary pattern associated with obesity in Korean adults??\nExplanation: The study found that a rice-based traditional dietary pattern was associated with obesity in Korean adults.

The likelihood of vomiting was increased if the child had a history of recurrent headaches. If the headaches were migrainous, the likelihood of vomiting increased further. All 15 children with a history of motion sickness vomited after the head injury. Family history of migraine, particularly maternal (n = 21), also predicted recurrent vomiting (p <0.001). If more than one of these predictive variables was present, the likelihood of vomiting was 100%.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Although sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor activation by FTY720 (fingolimod) has been suggested to improve the prognosis of experimental stroke, the effect of the drug in early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the precise mechanism of the effect are undetermined. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of systemic administration of FTY720 in EBI after SAH and assessed the mechanism using intracerebroventricular infusion of VPC23019 which is the S1P receptor antagonist.\nContext 2: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe cerebrovascular disease frequently caused by ruptured aneurysms. Early brain injury (EBI) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients diagnosed with SAH and is associated with increased intracranial pressure, decreased cerebral blood flow and cerebral ischemia. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylxanthine derivative clinically proven to improve perfusion in the peripheral microcirculation and has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in brain trauma and global cerebral ischemia in experimental animal models. This study aimed to determine the effect of PTX in experimental SAH, which has not been investigated yet.\nContext 3: Systemic administration of FTY720 significantly ameliorated SAH-induced neurological deficits and brain edema without modulation of CBF, the amount of subarachnoid blood, and cardiac edema. Blockage of central S1P receptor with VPC23019 did not abolish the protective effects of FTY720.\nContext 4: Vasospasm-induced delayed cerebral ischemia remains a major source of morbidity in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We hypothesized that activating innate neurovascular protective mechanisms by preconditioning (PC) may represent a novel therapeutic approach against SAH-induced vasospasm and neurological deficits and, secondarily, that the neurovascular protection it provides is mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).\nContext 5: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an important signaling factor in the vascular proliferation and contraction, the two features of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. We studied the possible involvement of MAPK in hemolysate-induced signal transduction and contraction in rabbit basilar artery.\n\nBased on the results of the present study, we conclude that FTY720 has a neuroprotective effect in EBI after SAH and that the effect is mediated by S1P receptor activation. The neuroprotective effect of FTY720 is not mediated by the activation of eNOS. The neuroprotective effect of FTY720 is not mediated by the activation of eNOS.

We analyzed the outcome of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) in the HAART era according to HIV serostatus to establish whether this also holds true for HL.\nContext 3: Patients with KS, ICC, NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), treated at Lausanne University Hospital between January 2002 and July 2012, were studied retrospectively. HIV testing was considered part of the oncology work-up if performed between 90 days before and 90 days after the cancer diagnosis date.\nContext 4: Patients from the Danish and Swedish lymphoma registries were included according to the following criteria: newly diagnosed DLBCL from 2007 to 2012, age 18 to 65 years, and CR after R-CHOP/CHOEP. Follow-up for Swedish patients included symptom assessment, clinical examinations, and blood tests at 3- to 4-month intervals for 2 years, with longer intervals later in follow-up. Imaging was only recommended when relapse was clinically suspected. Follow-up for Danish patients was similar but included routine imaging (usually computed tomography every 6 months for 2 years).\nContext 5: Between October 1987 and September 1998, 330 patients received ASCT after achieving complete remission with the ACBVP induction regimen.

We hypothesised that sepsis in humans is associated with differential gene expression of the \u03b3c cytokines and their associated apoptosis mediators.\nContext 2", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Somatic symptoms unexplained by disease are common in all medical settings. The process of identifying such patients requires a clinical assessment often supported by clinical tests. Such assessments are time-consuming and expensive. Consequently the observation that such patients tend to report a greater number of symptom has led to the use of self-rated somatic symptom counts as a simpler and cheaper diagnostic aid and proxy measure for epidemiological surveys. However, despite their increasing popularity there is little evidence to support their validity.\nContext 2: We found 1144/3781 new outpatients had symptoms that were unexplained by disease. The patients with symptoms unexplained by disease reported higher symptoms count scores (PHQ 15: 5.6 (95% CI 5.4 to 5.8) vs 4.2 (4.1 to 4.4) p<0.0001). However, the PHQ15 performed little better than chance in its ability to identify patients with symptoms unexplained by disease. The findings with the enhanced scales were similar.\nContext 3: We tested the score on a commonly used self-rated symptom questionnaire- the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 15) (plus enhanced iterations including an additional 10 items on specific neurological symptoms and an additional 5 items on mental state) for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity against a medical assessment (with 18\u2005months follow-up) in a prospective cohort study of 3781 newly attending patients at neurology clinics in Scotland, UK.\nContext 4: For pooled analyses least squares mean (SE) change from baseline in 24-hour pain intensity vs placebo was -0.60 (0.24, 90% CI -0.99, -0.20) overall and -0.99 (0.32, p=0.002) and -0.17 (0.36, p=0.650) for females and males, respectively. The improvement in pain intensity was significant (p=0.011) for patients with symptoms suggesting the concomitant presence of nonurological associated somatic syndromes but not for those with pelvic pain symptoms only (p=0.507).\nContext 5: Demographic and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom data were collected from 4224 adult patients via the Rome III questionnaire. Somatisation data were collected using the patient health questionnaire-12. Mean somatisation score and number of somatic symptoms were compared between IBS patients and controls with minimal GI symptoms, and between IBS patients and controls with moderate to severe GI symptoms. The mean somatisation score was significantly higher in IBS patients with minimal GI symptoms (p=0.001) and IBS patients with moderate to severe GI symptoms (p=0.001).

Some of the mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance, and they have been proposed to be involved in the common (polygenic) predisposition to tuberculosis (TB). We set out to test this hypothesis in two populations from Siberian region of Russia with high prevalence of TB.\nContext 2: We recently described the Mycobacterium tuberculosis RD(Rio) genotype, a clonally derived sublineage within the Latin American-Mediterranean (LAM) family. Genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis likely affects the clinical aspects of tuberculosis  (TB). Prospective studies that address this issue are scarce and remain controversial.\nContext 3: Drug resistant (DR) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is increasing worldwide. In some parts of the world 10% or more of new TB cases are MDR. The Beijing genotype is a distinct genetic lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is distributed worldwide, and has caused large outbreaks of MDR-TB. It has been proposed that certain lineages of M. tuberculosis, such as the Beijing lineage, may have specific adaptive advantages. We have investigated the presence and transmission of DR Beijing strains in the Swedish population.\nContext 4: All DR M. tuberculosis complex isolates between 1994 and 2008 were studied. Isolates that were of Beijing genotype were investigated for specific resistance mutations and phylogenetic markers. Seventy (13%) of 536 DR strains were of Beijing genotype. The majority of the patients with Beijing strains were foreign born, and their country of origin reflects the countries where the Beijing genotype is most prevalent. Multidrug-resistance was significantly more common in Beijing strains than in non-Beijing strains. There was a correlation between the Beijing genotype and specific resistance mutations in the katG gene, the mabA-inhA-promotor and the rpoB gene. By a combined use of RD deletions, spoligotyping, IS1547, mutT gene polymorphism and Rv3135 gene analysis the Beijing strains could be divided into 11 genomic sublineages. Of the patients with Beijing strains 28 (41%) were found in altogether 10 clusters (2-5 per cluster), as defined by RFLP IS6110, while 52% of the patients with non-Beijing strains were found in 3 clusters (1-3 per cluster). The Beijing strains were found in 3 clusters, while the non-Beijing strains were found in 2 clusters.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether conversion from the twice-daily tacrolimus formulation (Tac-TD) to a once-daily formulation (Tac-OD) leads to a lower IPV in tacrolimus exposure.\nContext 2: We observed a significant increase in tacrolimus daily doses, starting with a dose of 0.063 mg/kg of Prograf, increasing up to 0.081 mg/kg of Advagraf at 6 months (P<0.0001). After conversion, we observed a quick and sustained decrease in trough tacrolimus levels, decreasing from 8.05 ng/mL at day 0 to 6.30 ng/mL at day 180 (P=0.0009). At 6 months, 35% of patients experienced a decrease in trough levels of more than 30%. Creatinine values remained stable over time, and no patient experienced an acute rejection episode.\nContext 3: There was a significant association between increasing dose of tacrolimus and decreasing rejection score at both 15 and 30 days (P <.001). In the groups treated with 0.1 mg/kg T, an increasing dose of mycophenolate was associated with lower rejection scores at both 15 and 30 days (P =.001). In the group treated with 0.2 mg/kg T, there was no evidence that the addition of mycophenolate resulted in lower rejection at 15 days. However, at 30 days, combination therapy with increasing doses of mycophenolate was associated with decreasing rejection score (P =.002).\nContext 4: We retrospectively reviewed data from 55 patients for whom a switch from Prograf to Advagraf was identified. Tacrolimus daily doses and concomitant blood levels were analyzed at several time points ranging from 3 months before to 6 months after conversion.\nContext 5: Advagraf is a slow release form of tacrolimus with once-daily formulation.

Wogonin (50 \u03bcmol/L) decreased palmitate-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The ER stress inhibitor 4-phenyl butyric acid (5 mmol/L) significantly decreased palmitate-induced apoptotic cells, and occluded the anti-apoptotic effect of wogonin (25 \u03bcmol/L). Wogonin (10, 25 and 50 \u03bcmol/L) significantly reduced the intracellular diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation and expression levels of phosphorylated PKCs in palmitate-treated VSMCs.\nContext 3: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are frequently used lipid-lowering drugs. Moreover, they exert pleiotropic effects on cellular stress responses and death. Here, we analysed whether lovastatin affects the sensitivity of primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) to the anticancer drug doxorubicin.\nContext 4: DICAM was expressed on the endothelial cells of large vessels to small capillaries. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), DICAM was up-regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, the exogenous expression of DICAM in HUVECs suppressed angiogenesis in vitro Matrigel and in vivo plug assays, and conversely, DICAM knockdown enhanced angiogenesis. In addition, DICAM inhibited HUVEC migration and accelerated apoptosis via down-regulation of Bcl-2, but did not affect viability or proliferation of HUVEC. Mechanistically, the exogenous expression of DICAM suppressed VEGF-induced phosphorylarion of AKT and p38 MAP kinase. When integrin signalling was activated by vitronectin, DICAM inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT and p38 MAP kinase. In addition, DICAM inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT and p38 MAP kinase, and inhibited VEGF-induced migration and apoptosis of HUVECs.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the flavonoid quercetin on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the underlying mechanisms.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the flavonoid quercetin on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the underlying mechanisms.\nContext 7:", "Question: Does long-term calcium supplementation affect the iron status of 12-14-y-old girls??\nExplanation: Calcium supplementation has been shown to increase the absorption of iron in adults, but the effect of calcium supplementation on iron status in children is unknown.

However, it is unknown whether PCSK9 acts directly on the LDLR or if PCSK9 activates another protein that in turn causes degradation of the LDLR.\nContext 2: Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor degradation, thereby providing a key pathway for LDL metabolism. PCSK9 mRNA expression may be upregulated by insulin in murine models. Here we examined effects of exogenous hyperinsulinemia on plasma PCSK9 levels in humans without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nContext 3: We have transiently transfected HepG2 cells with wild-type and mutant D374Y-PCSK9 plasmids to study the effect of the conditioned medium on the LDLR of untransfected HepG2 cells. The ability of the conditioned medium to reduce the internalization of LDL was abolished by removal of recombinant PCSK9 from the conditioned medium by affinity chromatography. Thus, PCSK9 is the only factor in the conditioned medium able to mediate degradation of the LDLR. Moreover, fractionation of the conditioned medium by gel filtration showed that the ability of the fractions to reduce the internalization of LDL, closely paralleled the amount of D374Y-PCSK9 in the fractions. Incubation of a secreted, truncated LDLR without cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, as well as membrane fractions from HepG2 cells, with conditioned medium containing PCSK9, did not reduce the amount of LDLR as determined by western blot analysis. Thus, the LDLR is not degraded by PCSK9 on the cell surface. The LDLR of HepG2 cells incubated with conditioned medium was protected from PCSK9-mediated degradation by the addition of nocodazole or ammonium chloride, but was not protected when the conditioned medium was made hypertonic. These findings indicate that the intracellular degradation of the LDLR involves intracellular transport along microtubules, an acidic intracellular compartment and that it occurs even when endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits has been blocked.\nContext 4: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PSCK9) is secreted mainly from the liver and is a key regulator of LDL receptor (LDLR) degradation. The LDLR is internalized by clathrin-coated pits and then trafficked to the endosome, where it is degraded by the proteasome. The LDLR is also degraded by PSCK9 in the cytoplasm. The aim of this study was to determine whether PSCK9 is secreted from the liver and whether it is involved in the degradation of the LDLR in the liver.\nContext 5: We have previously shown that the LDLR is degraded by PSCK9 in the cytoplasm. Here we show that PSCK9 is secreted from the liver and that it is involved in the degradation of the LDLR in the liver.\nContext", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Fas/CD95 is a critical mediator of cell death in many chronic and acute liver diseases and induces apoptosis in primary hepatocytes in vitro. In contrast, the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) fails to provoke cell death in isolated hepatocytes but has been implicated in hepatocyte apoptosis during liver diseases associated with chronic inflammation. Here we report that TNF\u03b1 sensitizes primary murine hepatocytes cultured on collagen to Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis. This synergism is time-dependent and is specifically mediated by TNF\u03b1. Fas itself is essential for the sensitization, but neither Fas up-regulation nor endogenous FasL is responsible for this effect. Although FasL is shown to induce Bid-independent apoptosis in hepatocytes cultured on collagen, the sensitizing effect of TNF\u03b1 is clearly dependent on Bid. Moreover, both c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and Bim, another B cell lymphoma 2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only protein, are crucial mediators of TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis sensitization. Bim and Bid activate the mitochondrial amplification loop and induce cytochrome c release, a hallmark of type II apoptosis. The mechanism of TNF\u03b1-induced sensitization is supported by a mathematical model that correctly reproduces the biological findings. Finally, our results are physiologically relevant because TNF\u03b1 also induces sensitivity to agonistic anti-Fas-induced liver damage.\nContext 2: Fas ligand (FasL)-Fas and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) interactions regulate immune responses and contribute to self-tolerance by mediating antigen-driven T cell apoptosis. It is not known whether FasL and TNFalpha, expressed by the recipient's lymphoid or nonlymphoid cells, are essential for the apoptosis of alloreactive T lymphocytes and the induction of allograft acceptance.\nContext 3: Since Fas-mediated apoptosis is a common mechanism of hepatocyte destruction, we investigated the potential role of Fas receptor as a regulator of hepatic mass in IRS-1 transgenic mice.\nContext 4: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members play a key role in the regulation of biological functions such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of various cell types.\nContext 5: This study investigated whether different variants of hepatitis C virus core or E2 protein interfere with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1) signalling in hepatocytes.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the regulation of the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the regulation of the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.\nContext 8: The aim of this study", "No. Reasons persons with COPD give for not walking more do not predict their daily step count.", "Question: Does oral clonidine premedication reduce postoperative vomiting in children undergoing strabismus surgery??\nContext 1: We evaluated the effect of oral clonidine on postoperative vomiting (POV) in children undergoing strabismus surgery.\nContext 2: Pediatric strabismus surgery may be associated with postoperative nausea, vomiting, and emergence agitation (restlessness, thrashing, crying, moaning, disorientation).

Little information, however, exists about the interrelationship of obesity, fitness, and statin treatment on mortality.\nContext 3: There were 930 deaths during a mean follow-up period of 10.5 years (37 826 person-years), with an average annual mortality of 24.6 events per 1000 person-years of observation. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that mortality risk was 34% lower (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66; confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.77) for individuals treated with statins compared with those not on statins. There was a paradoxical BMI-mortality association, with the highest mortality in those with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2) (HR = 1.54; CI = 1.26-1.87, P <.0001) compared with obese subjects (BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m(2)). However, this paradoxical association was evident only in those not treated with statins (HR = 1.79; CI = 1.39-2.29; P <.001) vs those on statins (HR = 1.06; CI = 0.75-1.54; P =.70). When statin therapy and fitness status were combined, mortality risk was 44% higher (HR = 1.44; CI = 1.16-1.78) in the least-fit not treated with statins compared with the least-fit treated with statins. Mortality risk declined progressively with increased fitness to 60% lower (HR = 0.40; CI = 0.24-0.66) and 49% lower (HR = 0.51; CI = 0.38-0.68) for the most highly fit individuals (>9 metabolic equivalents) treated and not treated with statins, respectively.\nContext 4: The effect of statins on insulin resistance is controversial and poorly studied in nondiabetic subjects. In addition, the effect of statins on leptin and adiponectin has never been studied.\nContext 5: We hypothesized that statin therapy would be associated with a reduction in insulin resistance and an increase in adiponectin and leptin levels in nondiabetic subjects.\nContext 6: We studied 100 nondiabetic subjects (mean age, 55.5 years; 50% men) who were treated with statins for 6 months and 100 nondiabetic subjects (mean age, 55.5 years; 50% men) who were not treated with statins.\nContext 7: We measured fasting insulin, glucose, and lipid levels, and we measured insulin resistance, adiponectin, and leptin levels.\nContext 8: We found that statin therapy was associated with a significant", "No, evolutionary constraint does not help unmask a splicing regulatory region in BRCA1 exon 11.\nExplanation: The splicing regulatory region of BRCA1 exon 11 is not under evolutionary constraint.

SOX4 is over-expressed in several cancers and has prognostic significance. This study evaluated whether SOX4 affects oncogenic behavior and chemoradiotherapy response in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, and documented the relationship between its expression and prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).\nContext 2: SOX4 knockdown (KO) decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by activating caspases-3 and -7, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase and suppressing X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in HNSCC cells; it also enhanced radiation/cisplatin-induced apoptosis; and suppressed tumor cell invasion and migration. Immunostaining showed SOX4 protein was significantly increased in OSCC tissues compared with adjacent normal mucosa. SOX4 expression was observed in 51.8 % of 85 OSCC tissues, and was significantly correlated with treatment failure (P\u2009=\u20090.032) and shorter overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.036) in patients with OSCC.\nContext 3: We used small interfering RNA in HNSCC cells to evaluate the effect of SOX4 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, chemoradiation-induced apoptosis, invasion, and migration. SOX4 expression in OSCC tissues was investigated by immunohistochemistry.\nContext 4: No or weak expression of SOX11 mRNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues of SOX11 gene promoter methylation. Strong expression of SOX11 mRNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues of SOX11 gene promoter unmethylation and chronic inflammation tissues of pharynx nasalis. SOX11 mRNA and protein were re-expressed, SOX11 gene was demethylated, and growth and invasion of cells were inhibited in CNE2 cell line after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment.\nContext 5: The transcription factor SOX11 is one of members of the SRY box-containing (SOX) family emerging as important transcriptional regulators. In recent years, up-regulation of SOX11 has been detected in various types of solid tumors. In this study, the effects of promoter methylation of the SOX11 gene on SOX11 expression and cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. The results showed that SOX11 expression was significantly decreased in NPC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. SOX11 gene promoter methylation was detected in 20.0 % of NPC tissues. SOX11 gene promoter methylation was significantly correlated with tumor size (P\u2009=\u20090.001), lymph node metastasis (P\u2009=\u20090.001), and distant metastasis (P\u2009=\u20090.001). SOX11 gene promoter methylation was significantly correlated with tumor size (P\u2009=\u20090.001), lymph node metastasis (P\u2009=\u20090.001), and distant metastasis (P\u2009=", "Question: Is adjunctive atropine unnecessary during ketamine sedation in children??\nExplanation: The use of ketamine for procedural sedation in children is common. The use of atropine is often recommended to prevent the development of hypotension and bradycardia. However, there is limited evidence to support the use of atropine in children. The use of atropine is associated with a small increase in IOP, but the clinical significance of this is unknown. The use of atropine is not recommended in children with a history of glaucoma or other ocular disease. The use of atropine is not recommended in children with a history of asthma or other respiratory disease.

Of those who underwent reconstruction, 209 (63%) and 122 (37%) underwent immediate and delayed reconstruction, respectively. Univariate analysis showed improved breast cancer-specific survival among all breast reconstruction patients compared with patients who underwent mastectomy alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.86). In a multivariate model fitting a time-varying covariate to adjust for timing of reconstruction from mastectomy, no difference in survival was observed between patients who underwent reconstruction at any time and those who underwent mastectomy only (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-1.00). No differences in breast cancer-specific survival were observed on the basis of type of reconstruction.\nContext 2: Debate remains over the optimal timing of breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Immediate reconstruction has demonstrated superior psychosocial and aesthetic outcomes, but might delay adjuvant therapy. Conversely, delayed reconstruction allows for timely initiation of adjuvant therapy, but with potentially inferior aesthetic results. The authors examined whether any significant breast cancer-specific survival difference exists on the basis of the timing of reconstruction after mastectomy.\nContext 3: Among 2570 women diagnosed between 1989 and 1998 and referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency with pathologic (p)T1-2, pN0 invasive breast cancer treated with mastectomy, 94 had positive surgical margins and formed the study cohort. Women with more established indications for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) including T3-4 tumors or node-positive disease were excluded. Demographic, tumor, and treatment factors; relapse patterns; and Kaplan-Meier 8-year locoregional relapse-free, breast cancer-specific, and overall survival rates were compared between women who were treated with (n = 41) and without (n = 53) PMRT.\nContext 4: Using a cancer registry, medical insurance, and vital statistics sources, all Nova Scotia women who underwent unilateral mastectomy for breast cancer between 1989 and 2007 were followed to 2012 or time of death. Breast cancer-specific survival was compared for mastectomy patients who did or did not undergo reconstruction. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted adjusting for known demographic, disease severity variables, comorbidities, and reconstruction timing.\nContext 5: Among 10,000 women with invasive breast cancer treated with mastectomy, 1,000 underwent immediate reconstruction and 9,000 underwent delayed reconstruction. The authors examined whether any significant breast cancer-specific survival difference exists on the basis of the timing of reconstruction after mastectomy.\nContext 6: Among 10,000 women with invasive breast cancer treated with mastectomy, 1,000 underwent immediate reconstruction and 9,000 underwent delayed reconstruction.

The protection motivation theory, a model of behavioral change, was used to select the variables to assess the relation of parental attitudes with immunization status. A multivariate logistic regression analysis included only variables found to be significantly associated with immunization outcome in the preliminary analysis.\nContext 2: Mothers were well informed and generally had favorable attitudes toward immunizations. Immunization status was more strongly associated with the sociodemographic characteristics of the children than with the protection motivation theory variables. Only two protection motivation theory variables were associated with more than one immunization outcome. The children of mothers who perceived that timing of vaccination did not matter were less likely to be immunized than children of care takers who thought that it did matter and children whose parents believed in the safety of multiple immunizations were less likely to be immunized than children whose parents did not hold this belief.\nContext 3: This article describes the results of a community-based study to determine the effect of family knowledge and attitudes on the immunization rates of a random sample of children younger than 2 years in the poorest census tracts of Baltimore.\nContext 4: Cross-sectional studies suggest that maternal exposure to farming decreases the risk of allergic diseases in offspring. The potential underlying immunologic mechanisms are not understood.\nContext 5: The study sample comprised 20 patients with CVID (15 males, 5 females; mean (SD] age, 16.4 (9] years) and 63 first-degree relatives (18 mothers, 16 fathers, 16 sisters, 10 brothers, and 3 offspring). The rate of parental consanguinity was 75%. Of 17 family members with positive PID warning signs, 6 had concomitant hypogammaglobulinemia (3 low IgM levels, 2 selective IgA deficiency, and 1 partial IgA deficiency). The ISAAC questionnaire revealed allergic rhinitis in 3 mothers, asthma in 2 fathers, and 1 sibling. Skin prick testing revealed sensitization to aeroallergens in 31.6% of cases in addition to 1 parent and 1 sibling.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nThe article describes the results of a community-based study to determine the effect of family knowledge and attitudes on the immunization rates of a random sample of children younger than 2 years in the poorest census tracts of Baltimore.

It is unclear whether albumin per se or compounds bound to albumin are nephrotoxic. Some studies have supported the toxicity of albumin-bound fatty acids; however, these compared untreated, fatty acid containing, albumin and delipidated albumin. To prevent confounding by the delipidation procedure, we compared delipidated albumin and oleic acid (OA)-loaded delipidated albumin in two models: the classical rat protein overload and the Axolotl. The latter had an amphibian kidney with a subset of nephrons that drained the peritoneal cavity, so that i.p. injection of albumin selectively targeted open but not closed nephrons and was used to prevent removal of fatty acids from albumin in the circulation.\nContext 2: NRK52E cells, a rat renal proximal tubular cell line, were incubated with increased levels of albumin. The rat model of protein overload was established in female Wistar-Kyoto rats that were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of BSA at various doses (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 g/kg) or combination with intragastric administration of apocynin (100 mg/kg per day), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase.\nContext 3: Sodium intake did not modify renal functional and morphologic impairment induced by AA. The RAS blockade by ENA or ENA + CSN in rats receiving AA did not result in any statistical difference in terms of renal failure, proteinuria, and interstitial fibrosis on day 35 or 65. On day 35, the monocytes/macrophages infiltration was significantly decreased by two-fold when ENA (P < 0.01) or ENA + CSN (P < 0.01) was given from day 0.\nContext 4: Experimental aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), characterized by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and chronic renal failure, was reported after 35-day injections of aristolochic acids (AA) to salt-depleted male Wistar rats. The link between renal fibrosis and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this model remains unknown.\nContext 5: Aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) is a rare, chronic, and progressive renal disease characterized by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and chronic renal failure. The link between renal fibrosis and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in this model remains unknown. We investigated the role of the RAS in AAN using the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat in a rat model of AAN.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on the expression of the", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The objective of our study was to determine the incidence of central venous catheter-related bacteremia associated with rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters and standard catheters in patients with femoral and central jugular venous accesses.\nContext 2: We inserted 184 femoral (73 rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters and 111 standard catheters) and 241 central jugular venous catheters (114 rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters and 127 standard catheters). We found a lower rate of central venous catheter-related bacteremia associated with rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters than with standard catheters among patients with femoral access (0 vs. 8.62 cases per 1000 catheter-days; odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.86; P =.03) and among patients with central internal jugular access (0 vs. 4.93 cases per 1000 catheter-days; odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.00-0.93; P =.04).\nContext 3: The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not recommend the use of an antimicrobial- or antiseptic-impregnated catheter for short-term use. In previous studies, we have found a higher incidence of central venous catheter-related bacteremia among patients with femoral and central jugular accesses than among patients with other venous accesses.\nContext 4: We assessed the in vitro effect of exposing various bacteria to minocycline/rifampicin-impregnated vascular catheters on the antimicrobial activity of the catheters and the antimicrobial susceptibility of tested organisms.\nContext 5: Use of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in 250 words or less.\n\nThe objective of our study was to determine the incidence of central venous catheter-related bacteremia associated with rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters and standard catheters in patients with femoral and central jugular venous accesses.\n\nWe inserted 184 femoral (73 rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters and 111 standard catheters) and 241 central jugular venous catheters (114 rifampicin-miconazole-impregnated catheters and 127 standard catheters).

This is consistent with the findings of other studies that have found that dSM melancholic features are not associated with poorer response to ECT.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Arginase II regulates NOS activity by competing for the substrate l-arginine. Oxidized LDL (OxLDL) is a proatherogenic molecule that activates arginase II. We tested the hypotheses that OxLDL-dependent arginase II activation occurs through a specific receptor, and via a Rho GTPase effector mechanism that is inhibited by statins.\nContext 2: Arginase II activation by OxLDL was attenuated following preincubation with the LOX-1 receptor-blocking antibody JTX92. This also prevented the dissociation of arginase II from microtubules. LOX-1(-/-) mice failed to exhibit the increased arginase II activity seen in WT mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Furthermore, endothelium from LOX-1(-/-) mice failed to demonstrate the diet-dependent reduction in NO and increase in ROS that were observed in WT mice. OxLDL induced Rho translocation to the membrane and Rho activation, and these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with JTX92 or statins. Transfection with siRNA for RhoA, or inhibition of ROCK both decreased OxLDL-stimulated arginase II activation. Preincubation with simvastatin or lovastatin blocked OxLDL-induced dissociation of arginase II from microtubules and prevented microtubule depolymerization.\nContext 3: Oxidation inhibition reduced AR dependent expression of KLK3, TMPRSS2, hsa-miR-125b2, and hsa-miR-133b. And such reduction could be restored by H2 O2 treatment. KDM1A recruitment and H3K4me2 demethylation on ARE regions, which produce H2 O2, are associated with AR targets transcription. AR targets transcription and coupled oxidation recruit 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and the nuclease APEX1 to ARE regions. Such recruitment depends on KDM1A, and is necessary for AR targets transcription.\nContext 4: Surprisingly, both the wild-type and rocF mutant bacteria still colonized arginase II knockout mice. Moreover, feeding arginase II knockout mice the host arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine (BEC), while inhibiting > 50% of the host arginase activity, did not prevent colonization. This suggests that the host arginase inhibitor is not the only factor that regulates the colonization of the bacteria.\nContext 5: The host arginase inhibitor BEC is not the only factor that regulates the colonization of the bacteria. The host arginase inhibitor BEC is not the only factor that regulates the colonization of the bacteria.

This is because L-arginine is a substrate of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and L-NAME is a competitive inhibitor of eNOS. L-arginine is required for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), which is a vasodilator and a potent inhibitor of angiot", "Question: Does exposure to flaxseed during lactation alter prostate area or epithelium height but changes lipid profile in rats??\nExplanation: The present study aimed at evaluating the possible effect of the intake of this seed during lactation upon prostate, sexual hormones and lipidic profile of the offspring in adult life.\nContext 1: Flaxseed intake has increased owing to beneficial effects to health and prevention of diseases. Provided that it's an important source of lignan, a phytoestrogen, the present study aimed at evaluating the possible effect of the intake of this seed during lactation upon prostate, sexual hormones and lipidic profile of the offspring in adult life.\nContext 2: No differences were perceived concerning offspring food intake and body", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The blood-brain barrier represents a fundamental limitation in treating neurological disease because it prevents all neuropeptides from reaching the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, there is no efficient method to permanently bypass the blood-brain barrier.\nContext 2: The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved this study in an established murine 6-hydroxydopamine Parkinson disease model. A parietal craniotomy and arachnoid defect was repaired with a heterotopic donor mucosal graft. The therapeutic efficacy of GDNF (2 \u03bcg/mL) delivered through the mucosal graft was compared with direct intrastriatal GDNF injection (2 \u03bcg/mL) and saline control through the use of 2 behavioral assays (rotarod and apomorphine rotation). An immunohistological analysis was further used to compare the relative preservation of substantia nigra cell bodies between treatment groups.\nContext 3: It is a huge challenge to understand the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is a key element in neuroinflammation associated with many brain diseases. The BBB also regulates the passage of xenobiotics into the central nervous system (CNS), and therefore influences drug efficacy. This may be due to the presence of ATP binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) on the BBB, which are efflux pumps known to transport many drugs. The peptide endothelin 1 (ET-1) is involved in different kinds of CNS diseases and neuroinflammation, and is known to modulate Pgp transport activity. Although there are data from animal models, data from human models are scarce. We evaluated Pgp expression and transport activity in adult human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) when exposing an adult human in vitro BBB model to ET-1.\nContext 4: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a selectively permeable cerebrovascular endothelial barrier that maintains homeostasis between the periphery and the central nervous system. BBB disruption is a consequence of ischemic stroke and BBB permeability can be altered by infection/inflammation, but the complex cellular and molecular changes that result in this BBB alteration need to be elucidated to determine mechanisms.\nContext 5: To test the feasibility of using nasal mucosal graft reconstruction of arachnoid defects to deliver glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) for the treatment of Parkinson disease in a mouse model.\n\nBased on the context, the following questions were addressed:\n    - What is the effect of GDNF delivered through a mucosal graft on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a mouse model of Parkinson disease?\n    - What is the effect of GDNF delivered through a mucosal graft on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a mouse model of Parkinson disease?\n    - What is the effect of GDNF delivered through a mucosal graft on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a mouse model of Parkinson disease?\n    - What is the effect of GDNF delivered through a mucosal graft on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a mouse model of Parkinson disease?\n    - What is the", "Question: Are stressful life events associated with the development of dementia??\nExplanation: The study involved 2,462 dementia-free participants aged 55 years and older. Information on life events was ascertained at baseline from a comprehensive Life Event Inventory, which included 56 questions about specific life events. For each life event, the emotional impact (both positive and negative) and emotional adjustment were asked for. During follow-up, 423 participants developed dementia; of these, 240 developed Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cox regression analysis showed no association between the total number of negative life events and the incidence of dementia when adjusted solely for age and gender (hazard ratio = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.92-", "Contexts:\nContext 1: For patients with early stage colorectal cancer (CRC), markers of high-risk relapse are needed. In a previous study on 38 randomly selected patients with CRC, we found good correlation between presurgery cell-free DNA (CFD) concentrations and standard prognostic factors. In the current study, we revisited the same patients at 5-year survival, aiming to evaluate the predictive power of presurgery CFD levels.\nContext 2: ERCC1 is involved in the repair of oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage. Studies for the association of the C118T SNP with clinical response to treatment with platinum drugs have rendered inconsistent results. We investigated the ERCC1 C118T SNP with respect to overall and progression-free survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (ACC) treated with oxaliplatin and in vitro DNA repair capacity after oxaliplatin exposure. In addition we discuss discrepancies from other studies concerning ERCC1 C118T.\nContext 3: While sporadic cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) most commonly arise via the well-characterized chromosomal instability pathway (CIN), most other cases develop via a serrated neoplasia pathway (CIMP), in which methylation of CpG islands results in silencing of DNA nucleotide mismatch repair (MMR)-related genes, and a high level of microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI-high tumors typically show proximal location, mucinous histology, poor differentiation, and lymphocytic infiltration. Cell-free circulating DNA (CFD) may become elevated in CRC patients compared to healthy individuals. Because of these biological differences, we hypothesized that compared to MMR-proficient tumors MMR-deficient CRCs may produce higher CFD blood levels.\nContext 4: Six hundred seventy-five consecutive patients who underwent an elective resection for primary colorectal cancer from October 1999 to March 2004 were included in this study. We examined the associations between cancer recurrence and white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein.\nContext 5: Several studies have shown, that circulating tumor cells (CTC) have a negative prognostic value in colorectal cancer patients. Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CTC in specifically rectal cancer patients regarding the influence on overall survival and to elucidate the impact of CTC in predicting response after chemoradiation (RCTX).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, or maybe.\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    -", "Question: Is sensitivity an intrinsic property of a diagnostic test : empirical evidence from histological diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection??\nYes, sensitivity is an intrinsic property of a diagnostic test.

Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were obtained at the 5th-13th, 20th-26th, 30th-36th gestational weeks, and with 30-45 days postpartum. A food frequency questionnaire administered at the 30th-36th gestational week was used to measure dietary intake during pregnancy. Principal component analysis was performed to identify the dietary patterns. A longitudinal linear mixed-effects regression model was used to evaluate the association between the dietary patterns and BP (adjusted for time elapsed after conception and the women's age, education, parity, body mass index and total energy intake).\nContext 4: Hypertension and coronary heart disease are programmed by maternal undernutrition in utero. The feeding of low-protein diets to rats during their pregnancy results in higher blood pressure in the offspring from the age of weaning.\nContext 5: Three gestational dietary patterns were identified: healthy, common-Brazilian and processed. SBP/DBP mean values (SD) were 110.1 (9.0)/66.9 (7.5), 108.7 (9.0)/64.9 (6.7), 111.3 (9.2)/67.0 (6.9) and 115.0 (10.7)/73.7 (8.6) mmHg at the first, second and third gestational trimesters and postpartum, respectively. Women with higher/lower adherence to the processed pattern presented SBP of 117.9 and 113.0 mmHg (P = 0.037), respectively, during postpartum. No association was found between any of the three dietary patterns and SBP in the multiple longitudinal linear regression models, whereas 1 SD increase in the common-Brazilian pattern was associated with a small change of DBP (\u03b2 = 0.0006; 95% CI 4.66e-06, 0.0014; P = 0.03).\nContext 6: The common-Brazilian dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in the offspring.\nContext 7: The common-Brazilian dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in the offspring.\nContext 8: The common-Brazilian dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in the offspring.\nContext 9: The common-Brazilian dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in the offspring.\nContext 10: The common-Brazilian dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in the offspring.\nContext 11: The common-Brazilian dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of hypertension in the offspring.\nContext 12", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To determine the effect of dexamethasone on the phagocytic capacity of the human trabecular meshwork. A decrease in meshwork phagocytosis has been proposed in the pathogenesis of steroid glaucoma.\nContext 2: Ingested beads appeared green and could be differentiated from noningested beads, which appeared red, using appropriate wavelengths of the laser. Bead ingestion was confirmed with electron microscopy and the use of secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Dexamethasone decreased phagocytosis by 57%, as shown by the fact that trabecular cells in dexamethasone-treated meshworks ingested significantly fewer beads than cells in fellow control meshworks (1.5 +/- 0.6 beads/cell versus 3.5 +/- 1.4 beads/cell; P = 0.008). No evidence of significant migration or loss of trabecular cells was noted; the number of trabecular cells appeared similar in dexamethasone-treated and control meshworks (144 +/- 36 versus 141 +/- 46).\nContext 3: Although the effects of the colloid dextran 70 on induction of anaphylactoid reactions or reticuloendothelial phagocytosis have been examined previously, its effects on specific cell-mediated immunity after trauma-hemorrhage shock remain unknown.\nContext 4: Dexamethasone (DEX) regulates aqueous humor outflow by inducing a reorganization of the cytoskeleton to form cross-linked actin networks (CLANs) in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) has been demonstrated to have an important role in this process, but the upstream components leading to its activation remain elusive. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that noncanonical Wnt signaling mediates the DEX-induced CLAN formation in TM cells.\nContext 5: Treatment with dexamethasone resulted in a significant 43% reduction in lesion area without changes in lesion composition when compared with nontreated controls. However, dexamethasone, when administered for a prolonged period of time, is known for its potentially serious side effects. To overcome these potential side effects of prolonged dexamethasone treatment, the effect of a short-term 7-day dexamethasone treatment was studied. This short dexamethasone treatment resulted in a 50% reduction in lesion area without changes in lesion composition when compared with nontreated controls. The short-term dexamethasone treatment also resulted in a significant 50% reduction in the number of apoptotic cells in the lesion when compared with nontreated controls.

Thrombin-activatable carboxypeptidase B (CPB), also called thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, removes the C-terminal arginine from OPN-R, generating OPN-L and abrogating its enhanced cell binding. We undertook this study to investigate the roles of OPN-R and OPN-L in synoviocyte adhesion, which contributes to the formation of invasive pannus, and in neutrophil survival, which affects inflammatory infiltrates in RA.\nContext 2: Osteopontin (OPN) is thought to play an important role in rheumatoid synovitis. We investigated the expression of OPN in rheumatoid synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) and its potential association with genetic polymorphism of the OPN gene and joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nContext 3: Examination of expression of the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-3a (CCL20/Mip-3alpha) in blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and synovial fluid (SF) PMN of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nContext 4: Joint bleeding results in blood-induced arthropathy. We investigate whether a joint bleed alters protease-activated receptor (PAR) expression, and whether treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against PAR1-4 attenuates synovitis and cartilage damage.\nContext 5: High-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) has recently been identified as an endogenous mediator of arthritis. TNF and IL-1beta, pivotal cytokines in arthritis pathogenesis, both have the ability to induce the release of HMGB1 from myeloid and dendritic cells. It was, therefore, decided to investigate whether treatment based on TNF blockade in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects the expression of synovial HMGB1.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes\n    - No\n    - Maybe\n\n    - Yes", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Using RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis, we have discovered that HIV-1 Tat is associated with a specific set of human mRNAs in T cells. mRNAs bound by Tat share a stem-loop structural element and encode proteins with common biological roles. In contrast, we do not find evidence that Tat associates with microRNAs or the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The interaction of Tat with cellular RNA requires an intact RNA binding domain and Tat RNA binding is linked to an increase in RNA abundance in cell lines and during infection of primary CD4+ T cells by HIV.\nContext 2: Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) exhibits a wide range of interactions with the host cell but whether viral proteins interact with cellular RNA is not clear. A candidate interacting factor is the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein. Tat is required for expression of virus genes but activates transcription through an unusual mechanism; binding to an RNA stem-loop, the transactivation response element (TAR), with the host elongation factor P-TEFb. HIV-1 Tat has also been shown to alter the expression of host genes during infection, contributing to viral pathogenesis but, whether Tat also interacts with cellular RNAs is unknown.\nContext 3: HIV-induced gene expression in hRTECs was examined in vitro by Illumina RNA deep sequencing and revealed an innate response to HIV, which was subclassified by gene ontology biological process terms. Chemokine responses were examined by CD4 T-cell chemotaxis assays.\nContext 4: While viruses have long been shown to capitalize on their limited genomic size by utilizing both strands of DNA or complementary DNA/RNA intermediates to code for viral proteins, it has been assumed that human retroviruses have all their major proteins translated only from the plus or sense strand of RNA, despite their requirement for a dsDNA proviral intermediate. Several studies, however, have suggested the presence of antisense transcription for both HIV-1 and HTLV-1. More recently an antisense transcript responsible for the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) protein has been described. In this study we investigated the possibility of an antisense gene contained within the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR).\nContext 5: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) favors integration in active genes of host chromatin. It is not known whether HIV-1 integrates into the host genome in a cell type-specific manner. We have used a novel approach to identify cell type-specific integration sites in human T cells. We have developed a method to identify the integration sites of HIV-1 in T cells by using a combination of a cell line-specific promoter and a cell type-specific enhancer. We have identified 10 cell type-specific integration sites in T cells. We have also identified 10 cell type-specific integration sites in T cells.

Seventy-six percent of patients in the control group had pain during i.v. propofol as compared to 32% and 42% in the magnesium and the lidocaine groups respectively (P < 0.05). Lidocaine and magnesium pretreatment were equally effective in attenuating pain during the propofol injection (P > 0.05).\nContext 2: Pain at the site of intravenous injection of propofol is a common clinical finding. This double-blind, randomized cross-over study was designed to evaluate whether venous occlusion applied during injection of a low dose of propofol reduces the intensity of pain at the site of injection compared with no occlusion.\nContext 3: Propofol produces anesthesia with rapid recovery. However, it causes pain or discomfort on injection. A number of techniques have been tried for minimizing propofol-induced pain with variable results. We have compared the efficacy of magnesium and lidocaine for the prevention of propofol induced pain.\nContext 4: Three hundred ASA I and II adults undergoing elective surgery were randomly assigned into three groups of 100 each. Group I received magnesium sulfate 1 g, Group II received lidocaine 2% (40 mg) and Group III received normal saline, all in a volume of 2 mL and accompanied by venous occlusion for one minute. Induction with propofol 2.5 mg.kg(-1) was accomplished following the release of venous occlusion. Pain was assessed on a four-point scale: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain at the time of pretreatment and propofol injection. Results were analyzed by 'Z' test. A P value of < 0.05 was considered as significant.\nContext 5: Bilateral 0.5-ml injections of an emulsion containing 10 mg/ml of propofol were given over 30 s in 75 adult surgical patients.

Results from current studies suggest that this occurs via modulation of the radiation-induced inflammatory response.\nContext 2: As a renotropic cytokine, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) prevents acute renal failure and accelerates renal regeneration. HGF initiates its biological effects by interaction with specific transmembrane receptors, the c-Met proto-oncogene, possessing an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. We tested the hypothesis of whether the complex biological effects of HGF in renal proximal tubular cells are mediated by different intracellular signalling cascades and/or different receptors.\nContext 3: Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is known to be a key fibrogenic cytokine in a number of chronic fibrotic diseases, including chronic allograft nephropathy.

Six-week infusion of olanzapine at 1.5 but not 1mg/animal/day induced significant adiposity in subcutaneous, epididymal, and retroperitoneal fat. Body weight and food intake values did not differ between olanzapine- and vehicle-treated rats throughout the experiment.\nContext 3: An electrical microinfusion pump was subcutaneously implanted in male Sprague-Dawley rats who were then chronically administered olanzapine. Plasma olanzapine concentration and body weight were monitored, and fat pads were weighed after six weeks' olanzapine treatment.\nContext 4: Treatment with olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic drug) is frequently associated with various metabolic anomalies, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Recent data suggest that olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), which dissolve instantaneously in the mouth, might cause less weight gain than olanzapine standard oral tablets (OST).\nContext 5: We found that long-term treatment with olanzapine resulted in mean gains in weight and body mass index (BMI) of 5.2 kg and 1.93 kg/m(2), respectively.

This was accomplished by utilizing a pre-loading experimental design at different ranges of index finger motion (25, 50 and 75 degrees), so that the movement kinematic profiles (velocity and acceleration) and rate of force development remained constant within each given range of motion. Time-domain averaging of EEG single trials was applied in order to extract 3 movement-related potentials (BP(-600 to -500), BP(-100 to 0) and N(0 to 100)) preceding and accompanying 25, 50 and 75 degrees of unilateral finger movement with no pre-load (0 g), small pre-load (100 g) and large pre-load (200 g).\nContext 2: The present study was designed to obtain additional data regarding the differential influence of kinematic parameters and different nominal force levels upon components of movement-related cortical potentials (MRP) during index finger flexion.\nContext 3: We investigated the effect of varied intensities (low, 1.19 \u00b1 0.07 mA; intermediate, 3.33 \u00b1 0.27 mA; and high, 4.42 \u00b1 0.56 mA) on the outcome of a 30-minute electrical rSS applied to the index finger (intermittent high-frequency stimulation, 20 Hz and interburst interval, 5 seconds) in three groups (n = 10 each) of participants.

The channel-forming activity of full-length BAD and BAD peptides was carried out by lipid bilayer measurements. Interactions between proteins and peptides were monitored by the surface plasmon resonance technique. In aqueous solution, C-terminal part of BAD exhibits a well-ordered structure and stable conformation. In a lipid environment, the helical propensity considerably increases. The interaction of the C-terminal segment of BAD with the isolated BH3 domain results in the formation of permanently open pores whereby the phosphorylation of serine 118 within the BH3 domain is necessary for effective pore formation. In contrast, phosphorylation of serine 99 in combination with 14-3-3 association suppresses formation of channels. C-terminal part of BAD controls BAD function by structural transitions, lipid binding and phosphorylation. Conformational changes of this region upon membrane interaction in conjunction with phosphorylation of the BH3 domain suggest a novel mechanism for regulation of BAD.\nContext 2: BAD protein (Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death) belongs to the BH3-only subfamily of proapoptotic proteins and is proposed to function as the sentinel of the cellular health status. Physiological activity of BAD is regulated by phosphorylation, association with 14-3-3 proteins, binding to membrane lipids and pore formation. Since the functional role of the BAD C-terminal part has not been considered so far, we have investigated here the interplay of the structure and function of this region.\nContext 3: The results revealed that camphor modulates TRPV1 channel through the outer pore helix domain by affecting its overall gating equilibrium. In addition, camphor, which generally is known to decrease the fluidity of cell plasma membranes, may also regulate the activity of TRPV1 by inducing changes in the spatial distribution of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.\nContext 4: Glycoprotein 210 (GP210) is a transmembrane component of the nuclear pore complex of metazoans, with a short carboxyterminus protruding towards the cytoplasm. Its function is unknown, but it is considered to be a major structural component of metazoan nuclear pores. Yet, our previous findings showed pronounced differences in expression levels in embryonic mouse tissues and cell lines. In order to identify factors regulating GP210, the genomic sequence of GP210 was analyzed. The results revealed that GP210 is a member of the family of the nuclear pore complex proteins, which are involved in the assembly of the nuclear pore complex. The expression of GP210 is regulated by the transcription factor E2F1. The results also showed that GP210 is a novel member of the nuclear pore complex family, which is involved in the assembly of the nuclear pore complex.\nContext 5: The results revealed that camphor modulates TRPV1 channel through the outer pore helix domain by affecting its overall gating equilibrium.

O-Glycans of circulatory IgA1 consist of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) with a \u03b21,3-linked galactose; both sugars may be sialylated. In patients with IgAN, \u03b12,6-sialylated GalNAc is a frequent form of the galactose-deficient O-glycans. Prior analyses of IgA1-producing cells had indicated that \u03b12,6-sialyltransferase II (ST6GalNAc-II) is likely responsible for sialylation of GalNAc of galactose-deficient IgA1, but direct evidence is missing.\nContext 2: We analysed several SNPs in a region of this gene using 212 DNA samples from biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy patients, 146 men and 66 women and 477 healthy age-matched controls (321 men and 156 women) from the same population in Sweden.\nContext 3: Although serum under-O-glycosylated IgA1 in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients may deposit more preferentially in glomeruli than heavily-O-glycosylated IgA1, the relationship between the glomerular IgA deposition level and the O-glycan profiles of serum IgA1 remains obscure.\nContext 4: Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were devised to detect serum levels of UG binding to Fn or incorporated into IgA-Fn complexes and IgA binding to Fn or collagen IV. Sera from 75 patients with IgA nephropathy with normal renal function and various degrees of proteinuria (0.2 to 5 g/d of protein) stable over the previous 3 months without therapy were investigated and compared with healthy controls.\nContext 5: Few genetic factors have been identified that determine susceptibility to and progression of IgA-nephropathy (IgAN). Given that IgAN is usually characterized by mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis and that PDGF-B is of central pathophysiological relevance in this process, we analyzed four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PDGF-B gene to evaluate a possible association of these SNPs with IgAN.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the PDGF-B gene with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in a Chinese population.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the PDGF-B gene with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in a Chinese population.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the PDGF-B gene with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in a Chinese population.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the PDGF-B gene with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in a Chinese population.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Laparoscopic surgery (LS) has proved superior compared to conventional surgery (CS) regarding morbidity, length of hospital stay, rate of wound infection and time until recovery.

Nineteen children with asthma aged 7 to 13 y. Data on the prevalence of asthma among children aged 4-5 years and on hospitalisations for asthma among children less than 15 years old were available for 42 health service catchment areas within New York City. Street tree counts were provided by the New York City Department of Parks", "Question: Is gamma knife radiosurgery a successful adjunctive treatment in Cushing's disease??\nYes, gamma knife radiosurgery is a successful adjunctive treatment in Cushing's disease. The 4-year remission rates were 87% for patients with Cushing's disease, 67% for patients with acromegaly, and 18% for patients with prolactinomas. Patients with oversecretion of adrenocorticotropin or growth hormone were more likely to achieve remission after radiosurgery than patients with prolactinomas (hazard ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-18.2; P = 0.04). Of 44 patients with normal", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Cisplatin (CDDP) is employed to enhance radiotherapy's (RT) effect for various cancers. However, the effects of local RT on chemotherapeutics in the plasma and lymphatic system remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the influence of pelvic irradiation on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CDDP using rats as an experimental model.\nContext 2: Compared with sham-irradiated controls, the whole pelvic irradiation increased the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of CDDP (5 mg/kg) in the plasma by 80% at 0.5 Gy and 87% at 2 Gy, respectively. In contrast, the AUC of CDDP decreased in bile by 13% at both dose levels. Intriguingly, RT could also increase the AUC of CDDP (10 mg/kg) in the lymphatic fluid by 87% at 2 Gy. In addition, the AUC in CDDP without and with RT was 2.8-fold and 3.4-fold greater for the lymph system than for the plasma, respectively.\nContext 3: Data were obtained from 268 adult patients (163 males/105 females; median age, 54 years [range, 21 to 74 years]) with advanced solid tumors treated in phase I/II trials with cisplatin monotherapy or combination chemotherapy with etoposide, irinotecan, topotecan, or docetaxel. Cisplatin was administered either weekly (n = 93) or once every 3 weeks (n = 175) at dose levels of 50 to 100 mg/m(2) (3-hour infusion). Analysis of 485 complete courses was based on measurement of total and non-protein-bound cisplatin in plasma by atomic absorption spectrometry.\nContext 4: Most anticancer drugs are dosed based on body-surface area (BSA) to reduce interindividual variability of drug effects. We evaluated the relevance of this concept for cisplatin by analyzing cisplatin pharmacokinetics obtained in prospective studies in a large patient population.\nContext 5: No pharmacokinetic interaction was found between cisplatin and the anticancer drugs used in combination therapies. A linear correlation was observed between area under the curves of unbound and total cisplatin (r = 0.63). The mean plasma clearance of unbound cisplatin (CLun) was 0.25 L/h/kg, which was similar to the clearance of unbound irinotecan (0.26 L/h/kg) and similar to the clearance of unbound topotecan (0.24 L/h/kg). The mean volume of distribution of unbound cisplatin (Vun) was 0.5 L/kg, which was similar to the volume of distribution of unbound irinotecan (0.5 L/kg) and similar to the volume of distribution of unbound topotecan (0.5 L/kg). The mean apparent volume of distribution of unbound cisplatin (Vapp) was 0.5 L/kg, which was similar to the volume of distribution of", "No, backwash ileitis does not affect pouch outcome in patients with ulcerative colitis with restorative proctocolectomy.\nExplanation: Backwash ileitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the terminal ileum that is associated with a high risk of pouchitis. The risk of pouchitis is increased in patients with backwash ileitis, but the risk is not increased in patients with ileal pouches constructed after restorative proctocolectomy. The risk of pouchitis is increased in patients with backwash ileitis, but the risk is not increased in patients with ileal pouches", "Yes, angiotensin II receptor blockade attenuates the deleterious effects of exercise training on post-MI remodelling.\n\n## Context 1: The effects of exercise training on LV remodelling following large anterior myocardial infarction (MI) remains controversial. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been shown to prevent ventricular dilation and deleterious remodeling. We therefore tested, in a rat model of chronic MI, whether any potentially deleterious effects of exercise on post-MI remodelling could be ameliorated by angiotensin II receptor blockade.\n\nContext 2: Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) contributes to cardiac remodeling and left vent", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is known to protect against tissue injury by orchestrating antioxidant and detoxification responses to oxidative stress. This study investigated whether upregulation of Nrf2-dependent signaling by oleanolic acid (OA), which is known to activate Nrf2, could attenuate renal inflammation and fibrosis in cyclosporine (CsA)-induced kidney injury.\nContext 2: Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis.\nContext 3: JAK/STAT signaling was activated in adriamycin nephropathy. Phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT1 and STAT3 was significantly inhibited by AG490 (p <0.01). Compared to the vehicle-treated controls, AG490 treatment did not reduce proteinuria 2 weeks after induction of the disease, but resulted in significant decrease in proteinuria and serum creatinine at week 6 (p <0.05). Glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial lesions and renal alpha-SMA expression were also significantly suppressed by AG490 treatment at week 6 (p < 0.01). In addition, AG490 inhibited the expression of MCP-1 mRNA, accompanied by reduced interstitial infiltration of macrophages and T cells (p <0.05).\nContext 4: Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is characterized by progressive tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Rupture of the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis plays a critical role in renal atrophy. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a cytokine function on cell survival and tissue regeneration. We studied the effects and possible mechanisms of HGF gene therapy on tubular cell survival and anti-fibrosis in chronic obstructed nephropathy.\nContext 5: The unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO) model is a well-established animal model of chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HGF gene therapy on renal fibrosis in UUO rats.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HGF gene therapy on renal fibrosis in UUO rats.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HGF gene therapy on renal fibrosis in UUO rats.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HGF gene therapy on renal fibrosis in UUO rats.\nContext 9: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HGF gene therapy on renal fib", "Influenza vaccination is recommended for vulnerable individuals, including active drug users, to prevent influenza complications and decrease influenza spread. Recent studies suggest that opioids negatively regulate immune responses in experimental models, but the extent to which opioid use will affect the humoral responses to influenza vaccine in humans is unknown. This information is critical in maximizing vaccination efforts.\nBlood was collected from 29 patients before and 3-4 weeks after influenza vaccination and tested for phenotypic changes in lymphoid subpopulations and generation of antibodies against the allograft and vaccine.\nVaccination against influenza has been suggested to induce relapses of ANCA-associated vascul", "Contexts:\nContext 1: There were strong evidences that nitric oxide has capital importance in the progressive vasodilatation associated with varied circulatory shock forms, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). If CPB procedures, per se, are the inciting stimulus for inflammation, plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) excretion would be expected to be higher in these patients rather than in patients operated without CPB. In consequence, we hypothesized that increased levels of NOx would be predictive for vasoplegic syndrome.\nContext 2: Nitric oxide (NO) formed from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is assumed to promote vascular permeability in sepsis and endotoxemia.\nContext 3: Exhaled nitric oxide (NO), commonly accepted marker of airways inflammation, may be generated both by specific enzymes, NO synthases, as well as by nonenzymatic reduction in its metabolites. During asthma exacerbations, owing to lower airways pH, it has been reported that nitrite reduction may contribute to the increase in exhaled NO. Allergen exposure, an important cause of asthma exacerbations, is also known to increase exhaled NO.\nContext 4: Concentration of plasma nitrate (256 \u00b1 35 \u03bcM) and nitrite (334 \u00b1 86 nM) increased significantly (P < 0.05) after nitrate supplementation compared with placebo (nitrate: 44 \u00b1 11 \u03bcM; nitrite: 187 \u00b1 43 nM). In terms of exercise performance, there were no differences in either the mean distance (nitrate: 26.4 \u00b1 1.1 km; placebo: 26.3 \u00b1 1.2 km; P = 0.61) or mean power output (nitrate: 258 \u00b1 28 W; placebo: 257 \u00b1 28 W; P = 0.89) between treatments. Plasma ET-1 increased significantly (P < 0.05) just after exercise in nitrate (4.0 \u00b1 0.8 pg\u00b7mL) and placebo (2.4 \u00b1 0.4 pg\u00b7mL) conditions. This increase was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the nitrate group. Levels of nitrated proteins did not differ between treatments (nitrate: preexercise, 91% \u00b1 3%; postexercise, 91% \u00b1 3%; placebo: preexercise, 91% \u00b1 3%; postexercise, 91% \u00b1 3%; P = 0.99).\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in healthy subjects.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in healthy subjects.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance and plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels in", "Yes, the activation of neutrophil elastase-mediated fibrinolysis is sufficient to overcome the fibrinolytic shutdown of disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with systemic inflammation in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and major abdominal surgery.\nExplanation: The activation of neutrophil elastase-mediated fibrinolysis is sufficient to overcome the fibrinolytic shutdown of disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with systemic inflammation in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and major abdominal surgery. The activation of neutrophil elastase-mediated fibrinolysis is sufficient to overcome the fibrinolytic shutdown of disseminated intr", "Question: Do changes in BP induced by passive leg raising predict response to fluid loading in critically ill patients??\nExplanation: Passive leg raising (PLR) is a non-invasive method to increase venous return and cardiac output. It is a simple and effective method to increase cardiac output in patients with acute circulatory failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PLR on fluid responsiveness in patients with acute circulatory failure. We hypothesized that PLR would increase cardiac output and decrease fluid responsiveness in patients with acute circulatory failure. We also hypothesized that the change in cardiac output after PLR would correlate with the change in fluid responsiveness after fluid loading. We enrolled 24 patients with acute circulatory failure who were mechanically", "Question: Are pre-diabetes and well-controlled diabetes associated with periodontal disease : the SHIP Trend Study??\nContext 1: To examine associations of pre-diabetes and well-controlled diabetes with periodontitis.\nContext 2: The aim of this study was to find out if periodontal therapy has any effect on glycemic control of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).\nContext 3: The periodontal health status of 65 type 1 diabetic subjects was assessed at the baseline and 8 weeks after completion of periodontal therapy. Glycemic control was assessed on both visits by measuring the percentage of glycosylated haemoglobin (GHbA1c). The change in HbA1", "Question: Does a single intraportal administration of follistatin accelerate liver regeneration in partially hepatectomized rats??\nYes, follistatin accelerates liver regeneration in partially hepatectomized rats.\nNo, follistatin does not accelerate liver regeneration in partially hepatectomized rats.\nMaybe, follistatin does not accelerate liver regeneration in partially hepatectomized rats.\nExplanation: Follistatin is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily of proteins that bind to and inhibit the activity of activin A. Activin A is an autocrine negative regulator of DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes and is expressed in remnant liver after partial hepatectomy. To determine the role of activ", "Question: Is overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 associated with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma??\nExplanation: The results of this study showed that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma. The results of this study showed that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma. The results of this study showed that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma. The results of this study showed that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was associated with poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma. The results of this study showed that overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was associated with poor prognosis", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Oral colostrum priming (OCP) after birth in preterm infants is associated with improved weight gain and modification of the oral immunomicrobial environment. We hypothesized that OCP would modify salivary immune peptides and the oral microbiota in preterm infants.\nContext 2: Pretreatment with 0.5 or 1 ml colostral preparation reduced gastric injury by 30% and 60% respectively in rats. A milk preparation was much less efficacious. Recombinant transforming growth factor beta added at a dose similar to that found in the colostrum preparation (12.5 ng/rat), reduced injury by about 60%. Addition of colostrum to drinking water (10% vol/vol) prevented villus shortening in the mouse model of small intestinal injury. Addition of milk preparation was ineffective. Colostrum increased proliferation and cell migration of RIE-1 and HT-29 cells. These effects were mainly due to constituents of the colostrum with molecular weights greater than 30 kDa.\nContext 3: Palifermin is known as the effective growth factor to reduce the incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis (OM) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, additional data on the long-term safety of palifermin and its potential influence on graft versus host disease (GvHD) are needed.\nContext 4: Since 2006, cases of haemorrhagic diathesis in young calves have been observed with a much higher incidence than previously known. The syndrome, now uniformly called Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia (BNP), is characterized by multiple (external and internal) haemorrhages, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and bone marrow depletion. Although various infectious and toxicological causes of bleeding disorders in calves have been ruled out, the aetiology of BNP remains unknown. However, field observations have led to the hypothesis that the aetiological principle may be transmitted to calves via colostrum.The objective of the present study was to verify whether ingestion of colostrum from dams of known BNP calves can elicit signs of BNP and typical haematological findings in conveniently selected neonatal calves. Six such calves received one feeding of colostrum (or a mixture of colostrum batches) from dams of known BNP calves. As controls, another six conveniently selected calves received a mixture of colostrum batches from dams of healthy calves. The calves were observed for 14 days. The results showed that calves fed colostrum from BNP dams developed typical signs of BNP and haematological findings typical of BNP. The results also showed that calves fed colostrum from BNP dams had a significantly higher incidence of BNP than calves fed colostrum from healthy dams. The results suggest that ingestion of colostrum from BNP dams may be a risk factor for the development of BNP in calves.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of colostrum on the development of the immune system in preterm infants. The study", "Question: Does dextran 70 administration after trauma-hemorrhagic shock impair cellular immune functions??\nExplanation: The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of hypertonic saline with 6% dextran 70 (HSD) resuscitation on organ damage and the resuscitation efficiency of the combination of HSD and lactated ringers (LR) in a model of hemorrhage shock in dogs.\nThe study was conducted in 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 250-300 g). The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg for 60", "Question: Are increased resistin blood levels associated with insulin resistance in patients with renal disease??\nExplanation: Increased resistin blood levels are associated with insulin resistance in patients with renal disease. Resistin is a newly discovered insulin inhibitor secreted by adipocytes. We explored the potential role of resistin in the pathophysiological process of insulin resistance encountered in patients with renal disease. Patients with increased resistin blood concentrations had more advanced renal failure and were significantly older. Plasma resistin levels correlated significantly with GFR (r = -0.82; P < 0.0001), plasma homocysteine concentration (r = 0.68; P < 0.001), and age (r = 0.42;", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Age at onset (AO) in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is closely associated with the length of the CAG repeat at the mutant ATXN3 allele, but there are other intervening factors. Experimental evidence indicates that the normal ATXN3 allele and the C-terminal heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-interacting protein (CHIP) may be genetic modifiers of AO in MJD.\nContext 2: To investigate this hypothesis, we determined the length of normal and expanded CAG repeats at the ATXN3 gene in 210 unrelated patients with MJD. In addition, we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CHIP gene. We first compared the frequencies of the different genotypes in two subgroups of patients who were highly discordant for AO after correction for the length of the expanded CAG allele. The possible modifier effect of each gene was then evaluated in a stepwise multiple linear regression model.\nContext 3: No significant association was found between any SNP within the 4 selected loci and systemic-onset JIA, by either single-point or haplotype analysis.\nContext 4: AO was associated with the length of the expanded CAG allele (r(2)\u2009=\u20090.596, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Frequencies of the normal CAG repeats at the ATXN3 gene and of CHIP polymorphisms did not differ significantly between groups with highly discordant ages at onset. However, addition of the normal allele improved the model fit for prediction of AO (r(2)\u2009=\u20090.604, p\u2009=\u20090.014). Indeed, we found that the normal CAG allele at ATXN3 had a positive independent effect on AO.\nContext 5: None of the patients had mutations in CARD15 associated with Blau syndrome. Eight other variations were found in exon 4: single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)6 in 40% of the 104 alleles examined, SNP7 in 26%, c. 1833 C > T and SNP8 in 4%, c. 2107 C > T in 2%, and c. 931 C > T, c. 1292 C > T and c. 2377 G > A in 1%. One variation was found in intron 4 (IVS4 + 10 A > C) in 3% of the alleles. The IVS4 + 10 A > C variation was not associated with Blau syndrome.\nContext 6: The results of this study suggest that the normal CAG allele at the ATXN3 gene may be a genetic modifier of age at onset in MJD. The normal allele may be a modifier of the length of the expanded CAG allele at the ATXN3 gene, and this may be a genetic modifier of the age at onset in MJD.\nContext 7: The results of this study suggest that the normal CAG allele at the ATXN3 gene may be a genetic modifier of age at onset in MJD. The normal allele may be a modifier of the length of the expanded CAG allele at the AT", "Question: Is macrophage migration inhibitory factor inhibition deleterious for high-fat diet-induced cardiac dysfunction??\nExplanation: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is upregulated in the heart during cardiac cachexia. MIF is a potent inducer of macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine production. MIF is also a potent inducer of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. MIF is also a potent inducer of cardiac insulin resistance. MIF is also a potent inducer of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. MIF is also a potent inducer of cardiac insulin resistance. MIF is a potent inducer of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, treated between 2010 and 2012, were retrospectively reviewed. Dysphagia scores (Mellow-Pinkas) were obtained before and after three cycles of perioperative chemotherapy together with clinicopathological patient characteristics. A clinical response was defined as improvement of dysphagia by at least 1 score from the baseline. The tumor response was defined as down staging of T-stage from initial computer tomography (CT) scan (cT-stage) to pathologic staging of surgical specimen (pT-stage). Patients were followed until death or censored on June 27th, 2014.\nContext 2: Monitoring treatment response to preoperative chemotherapy is of utmost importance to avoid treatment toxicity, especially in non-responding patients. Currently, no reliable methods exist for tumor response assessment after preoperative chemotherapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate dysphagia as a predictor of tumor response after preoperative chemotherapy and as a predictor of recurrence and survival.\nContext 3: Of the 110 included patients, 59.1% had improvement of dysphagia after three cycles of perioperative chemotherapy, and 31.8% had a chemotherapy-induced tumor response after radical resection of tumor. Improvement of dysphagia was not correlated with the tumor response in the multivariate analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.23). Moreover, the presence of dysphagia was not correlated with recurrence (p\u2009=\u20090.92) or survival (p\u2009=\u20090.94) in the multivariate analysis.\nContext 4: Dysphagia is a common postoperative symptom after laparoscopic antireflux surgery, usually attributed to postoperative edema or a \"too tight\" fundoplication. Although it is usually self-limited, it occasionally requires endoscopic dilation and rarely revisionary surgery. It has not been previously described whether postoperative dysphagia is associated with poorer long-term reflux control after fundoplication.\nContext 5: We hypothesized that the presence of dysphagia in the early postoperative period is associated with long-term failure of the antireflux procedure and recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing antireflux surgery was performed. The study population included patients, who underwent primary laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication between the years 2008 and 2012. Dysphagia was defined as a score of 3 or more on the Mellow-Pinkas dysphagia scale. The primary outcome was the presence of dysphagia at 1 year after surgery. The secondary outcome was the presence of GERD symptoms at 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was defined as the presence of dysphagia at 1 year after surgery. The secondary outcome was defined as the presence of GERD symptoms at 1 year after surgery. The primary outcome was defined as the presence of dysphagia at 1 year after surgery. The secondary outcome was defined as the presence of GERD symptoms at 1 year after surgery. The primary", "No, leptin does not play a major role in platelet aggregation in obesity and leptin deficiency.", "Question: Is occurrence of both breast and ovarian cancer in a woman a marker for the BRCA gene mutations : a population-based study from western Sweden??\nExplanation: The study aimed to analyze whether the occurrence of both breast and ovarian cancer in a woman serves as a marker for BRCA gene mutations. The study included 256 women in western Sweden who developed both invasive breast and ovarian tumors between 1958 and 1999. Archival paraffin tissue blocks of their tumors were retrieved for DNA-extraction to analyze the founder mutation, BRCA1 c.3171_3175dup (c.3171ins5), which is most common in this geographic area and four other common Scandinavian BRCA1 gene mutations and one BRCA", "Contexts:\nContext 1: SFRP1 was identified as being significantly overexpressed in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Additionally, SFRP1 expression is significantly correlated with an increased probability of positive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Knockdown of SFRP1 in triple negative breast cancer cells renders the cells more resistant to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, tumorigenic properties of the cells are modified by knockdown, as shown by both migration or invasion capacity as well reduced apoptotic events. Surprisingly, we found that these effects do not rely on Wnt signaling. Furthermore, we show that pro-apoptotic as well as migratory pathways are differentially regulated after SFRP1 knockdown.\nContext 2: To verify the downregulation of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), a Wnt inhibitor and test KFs sensitivity to Wnt3a treatment compared to NFs in terms of activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, cellular growth, migration and ECM expressions. Next, to investigate if ectopic expression of SFRP1 and treatment of quercetin in KFs can reverse their phenotypes.\nContext 3: Osteosarcoma (OS), which has a high potential for developing metastatic disease, is the most frequent malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Molecular analysis of a metastatic genetically engineered mouse model of osteosarcoma identified enhanced expression of Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 2 (sFRP2), a putative regulator of Wnt signaling within metastatic tumors. Subsequent analysis correlated increased expression in the human disease, and within highly metastatic OS cells. However, the role of sFRP2 in osteosarcoma development and progression has not been well elucidated.\nContext 4: In the Wnt pathway, the secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) is thought to act as one of the several competitive inhibitors of Wnt. However, the precise role of SFRP2 is still poorly understood especially in B lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the function of SFRP2, comparing the SFRP2 defective as well as normal B lymphocytes in mice.\nContext 5: In order to identify genes correlating with both the triple negative breast cancer subtype as well as response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy we employed publicly available gene expression profiles of patients, which had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Analysis of tissue microarrays revealed that SFRP1 was significantly overexpressed in TNBC compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Additionally, SFRP1 expression is significantly correlated with an increased probability of positive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Knockdown of SFRP1 in triple negative breast cancer cells renders the cells more resistant to standard chemotherapy. Moreover, tumorigenic properties of the cells are modified by knockdown, as shown by both migration or invasion capacity as well reduced apoptotic events. Surprisingly, we found that these effects do not rely on Wnt signaling. Furthermore, we show that pro-apoptotic as well as migratory pathways are differentially regulated after SFRP1 knockdown.\nContext 6: To verify the down", "Question: Does diffusion-weighted Imaging ( DWI ) predict Upgrading of Gleason Score in Biopsy-proven Low-grade Prostate Cancers??\nContext 1: To analyze whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) predicts Gleason score (GS) upgrading in biopsy-proven low-grade prostate cancers.\nContext 2: A total of 132 patients who have biopsy-proven low-grade (GS< 7) prostate cancers, 3T DWI, and surgical confirmation were retrospectively included. Clinical [prostate-specific antigen, greatest percentage of biopsy core, and percentage of positive core number] and DWI parameters [minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC\nContext 3: In the current study, the authors propose the quantitative", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The etiology of intradialytic hemodynamic instability is multifactorial. Of the various factors involved, a rise in core temperature seems to be crucial. In this respect, the bioincompatibility of hemodialysis (HD) treatment might play an important role. The application of cool dialysate reduces the number of periods of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) considerably. In rats, roller pump perfusion caused hypotension by shear stress induced platelet aggregation and subsequent serotonin release. During clinical HD, citrate anticoagulation abolished platelet activation almost completely. Hence, citrate anticoagulation might reduce IDH, whereas the beneficial effect of cool dialysate might be partly explained by reduced platelet activation.\nContext 2: Intravenous infusion of antithrombin compounds has been shown to inhibit platelet-dependent thrombosis. However, hemorrhage is a common side effect associated with the systemic administration of antithrombin compounds.\nContext 3: In patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), activated platelets and altered haemostatic/fibrinolytic systems with and without thrombolytic therapy are known. Platelets thereby interact with neutrophils, stimulated endothelial cells and with monocytes leading to adverse effects on further myocardial damage. Thrombolysis in these patients is still hampered by procoagulant effects favoring early reocclusion. The additional treatment with a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist aimed to minimize early reocclusion thus improving the present therapeutic regimen.\nContext 4: Adequate anticoagulation was obtained with both anticoagulants. Haemodilution due to priming the extracorporeal system with Ringer's lactate and appropriately anticoagulated donor blood, was equivalent in both groups. During CPB with heparin, but not with hirudin, there was a significant increase in the number of circulating platelet aggregates, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and 111In-labelled platelet accumulation in the oxygenator. After the initial decrease in platelet count due to haemodilution, it further decreased significantly during CPB with heparin but remained relatively constant when r-Hirudin was used.\nContext 5: Citrate strongly reduced platelet activation, but did not improve IDH. The blood pressure was best preserved during cool-temperature HD, despite manifest platelet activation. The beneficial effect of cool-temperature HD might be explained by the reduced platelet activation.\nContext 6: The use of citrate anticoagulation in HD is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of IDH. The beneficial effect of cool-temperature HD might be explained by the reduced platelet activation.\nContext 7: The use of citrate anticoagulation in HD is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of IDH. The beneficial effect of cool-temperature HD might be explained by the reduced platelet activation.\nContext 8: The use of citrate anticoagulation in HD is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of IDH. The beneficial effect of cool-temperature HD might be", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To evaluate the possible beneficial effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) on both the decrease of toxicity related to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and the acceleration of the hematopoietic graft.\nContext 2: Twenty consecutive patients treated with BMT received pentoxifylline (400 mg/6 hours, orally) up to day +50 to prevent toxicity derived from BMT. A previous group of 29 consecutive patients transplanted in the same center were used as controls. The different clinical toxicities (mucositis, kidney failure, hepatic venocclusive disease, graft versus host disease, number of days with fever, day of hospital discharge and survival at day +50), the time elapsed until the hematopoietic graft and the levels of tumoral necrosis factor alpha were evaluated.\nContext 3: Moxifloxacin has a broad antibacterial spectrum and rapid bactericidal activity, and is thus a good option for the treatment of bacterial infections in patients who have undergone organ or bone marrow transplantation. Transplant patients also receive immunosuppressant therapy such as ciclosporin.\nContext 4: Patients (n = 9) with stable graft function after bone marrow or renal transplantation and who were already receiving ciclosporin therapy were enrolled into the study. The patients were given ciclosporin (Sandimmun Optoral) capsules twice daily (total daily dosage 150-380 mg/day) throughout the study period. Moxifloxacin (Avolox) tablets 400 mg once daily were given on days 2-8 inclusive. The primary outcome measure was the change in ciclosporin pharmacokinetics on coadministration with moxifloxacin. Secondary outcomes were the steady-state pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin and ciclosporin plus its metabolites in patients receiving moxifloxacin and ciclosporin concomitantly. Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetic parameters in the presence of ciclosporin were compared with previously published pharmacokinetic data for moxifloxacin in healthy individuals.\nContext 5: Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is difficult to treat.

To optimise the selection process for these therapy regimens especially in the field of cellular and molecular biology, new prognostic factors besides the established TNM system are being investigated.\nContext 3: Retrospective review of 103 patients with rectal cancer, divided into two groups: group A, 53 patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy with 45 Gy combined with chemotherapy, and group B, 50 patients with", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Polymorphisms near the IL28B gene have been proposed to be strongly associated with treatment response and the rate of spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus infection, and treatment response of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this study, we aimed to determine whether these polymorphisms could affect natural courses of HBV infection.\nContext 2: The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 with ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated-interferon alpha (peg-IFN\u03b1) provides a low-level sustained virological response (SVR). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene have been identified as SVR predictors. Our aim was to establish an association between three IL28B SNPs (rs8099917, rs12979860, and rs8103142) and the peg-IFN\u03b1/RBV treatment response in a Mexican population cohort with chronic HCV.\nContext 3: Egypt has the highest prevalence of HCV worldwide (15%) with a high morbidity and mortality from chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The Aim of this study was to investigate the associations between IL-28B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP rs12979860) and treatment outcome among Egyptian patients infected with HCV genotype 4.\nContext 4: The mechanisms by which interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) contributes to inter-individual heterogeneity in the severity of chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) are unknown. In 116 consecutive patients with CH-C, we tested the hypothesis that host genetic factors regulating IFN-gamma production and activity influence the severity of liver damage and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific T-cell reactivity.\nContext 5: Current data showed that 67% of patients carrying the IL28B 12979860 C/C allele had a sustained viral response (SVR) while the genotypes C/T and TT were associated with lower SVR rates, 50% and 48%, respectively. SVR rates for the C/C allele were lower than other HCV genotypes and/or other populations. Genotype CC was associated with the response to interferon (P = 0.025). Genotype C/C was reduced from 48% in controls to 14% in CHC patients suggesting its protective role against progression to chronicity. The majority of spontaneously cleared subjects (67%) were C/C. The C/C genotype was associated with a lower risk of spontaneous clearance (P = 0.001) and a lower risk of progression to cirrhosis (P = 0.001). The C/C genotype was associated with a lower risk of progression to cirrhosis (P = 0.001). The C/C genotype was associated with a lower risk of progression to cirrhosis (P = 0.001). The C/C genotype was associated with a lower risk of progression to cirrhosis (P = 0.001). The C/C genotype was associated with a lower risk of progression to cirrhosis (P = 0.001). The C/C genotype was associated with a", "Question: Is plantar pressure distribution in gait affected by targeted reduced plantar cutaneous sensation??\nExplanation: The purpose of this study was to identify possible causal dependences between reduced plantar cutaneous sensation and plantar pressure distribution during gait.\nThe intervention significantly reduced plantar cutaneous sensation to the level of sensory neuropathy. Plantar pressure and force variables, contact times for the entire foot and for the plantar foot regions were not influenced significantly.\nThe results of this study suggest that plantar pressure distribution in gait is not affected by targeted reduced plantar cutaneous sensation.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) promotes atherosclerosis in animal models. MMP-12 is expressed in only a subset of foam-cell macrophages (FCMs) in human plaques. We investigated whether the prevalence of this MMP-12-expressing subpopulation is a prognostic indicator of adverse outcome in patients after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).\nContext 2: It is well established that subjects with moderately elevated plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) have an increased risk of development of cardiovascular events. As atherosclerosis is a disease characterized by chronic arterial inflammation, it is possible that moderate increases in CRP level reflect the presence of plaque inflammation. To investigate this possibility, we compared plasma levels of hsCRP the day before carotid endarterectomy with the degree of inflammation in the excised plaque tissue.\nContext 3: Carotid plaques from 24 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) were classified as stable or unstable using clinical, histological, ultrasound, and transcranial Doppler criteria, and compared using whole genome microarray chips. Initial results of differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in an independent group of 96 patients undergoing CEA. The protein product of genes significantly differentially expressed between patients with stable and unstable plaques were analysed by plaque immunohistochemistry and serum protein quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on a further independent cohort.\nContext 4: Thirty-six patients with \u226570% carotid stenosis scheduled for carotid endarterectomy underwent a Colour Duplex ultrasound, (18)F-FDG PET/CT and blood tests less than 24\u2009h prior to surgery. Plaques were defined as symptomatic when associated with ipsilateral cerebral ischemic symptoms within 30 days prior to inclusion. Plaques were assessed histologically following endarterectomy. The level of agreement between (18)F-FDG uptake (mean SUVmax and SUVmax ), and target-to-background ratio, symptoms, plaque echolucency, and histological evidence of inflammation was assessed.\nContext 5: The feasibility of carotid stenting (CS) is no longer questionable, although its indications remain debatable. Until the results of randomized trials are available, personal series and registries should help in the comparison of long-term results of CS with those of endarterectomy. We report here the results of a prospective registry of 100 consecutive patients undergoing CS for symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on the incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on the incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To determine whether type II superior labral anterior posterior lesions significantly alter glenohumeral kinematics as defined by path of glenohumeral articulation in a simulated cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder.\nContext 2: A subtle but significant increase in external rotation (2.7 degrees) was seen after creating a type II lesion. Small increases in glenohumeral translation were found in the anterior (0.9 mm) and inferior (0.9 mm) directions with application of a 15-N force in the superior labral anterior posterior group. Increases in glenohumeral rotation and translation were restored to the intact state after repair of the lesion. No significant differences were found in the path of glenohumeral articulation for the superior labral anterior posterior condition compared with the intact shoulder.\nContext 3: Previous studies have demonstrated increased glenohumeral translations with simulated type II superior labral anterior posterior lesions, which may explain the sensation of instability in the overhead-throwing athlete. It is unknown whether this amount of increased translation alters glenohumeral kinematics.\nContext 4: Six cadaveric shoulders were tested for glenohumeral rotational range of motion and translation using a custom shoulder testing system and the Microscribe 3DLX. The path of glenohumeral articulation was measured by calculating the humeral head center with respect to the glenoid articular surface at maximal internal rotation, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and maximal external rotation. Data were recorded for vented intact shoulders, shoulders with arthroscopically created type II superior labral anterior posterior lesions, and shoulders with arthroscopically repaired superior labral anterior posterior lesions.\nContext 5: Thirty-six shoulder arthroplasties (12 TSAs, 24 RSAs) were analyzed, of which 18 procedures (6 TSAs, 12 RSAs) were executed using preoperative 3D planning and patient-specific guides to position the central guide pin for glenoid component implantation. In 9 cases, the glenoid anatomy was severely distorted through wear or previous surgery. The inclination of the glenoid component was measured by 2 observers, using the angle between the glenoid baseplate and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa (angle \u03b2) on postoperative radiographs.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, or maybe. If you are unsure, say so.\n\nThe results of this study suggest that type II superior labral anterior posterior lesions significantly alter glenohumeral kinematics as defined by path of glenohumeral articulation in a simulated cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder. This finding may explain the sensation of instability in the overhead-throwing athlete. It is unknown whether this amount of increased translation alters glenohumeral kinematics.\n\n## Context 1: To determine whether type II superior labral anterior posterior lesions significantly alter glenohumeral kinematics as defined by path of glenohumeral articulation in a simulated cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder.\n\nContext 2: A subtle", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To determine sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of routine fecal occult blood (FOB) testing on the identification of Bell's Stage II or III necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.\nContext 2: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Some infants recover uneventfully with medical therapy whereas others develop severe disease (that is, NEC requiring surgery or resulting in death). Repeated attempts to identify clinical parameters that would reliably identify infants with NEC most likely to progress to severe disease have been unsuccessful. We hypothesized that comprehensive prospective data collection at multiple centers would allow us to develop a model which would identify those babies at risk for progressive NEC.\nContext 3: Our objectives were to identify factors associated with the duration of the first antibiotic course initiated in the first 3 postnatal days and to assess associations between the duration of the initial antibiotic course and subsequent necrotizing enterocolitis or death in extremely low birth weight infants with sterile initial postnatal culture results.\nContext 4: A degree of feed intolerance after neonatal abdominal surgery is common but in an otherwise well baby enteral feeding usually is continued at the highest tolerated level. However, the presence of rectal bleeding, pneumatosis intestinalis, or portal vein gas seen on plain abdominal x-rays suggest the possibility of postoperative necrotising enterocolitis. When this happens feedings usually are stopped for 7 to 10 days, and intravenous antibiotics and total parental nutrition are commenced.\nContext 5: Of 5693 extremely low birth weight infants admitted to 19 centers, 4039 (71%) survived >5 days, received initial empirical antibiotic treatment, and had sterile initial culture results through the first 3 postnatal days. The median therapy duration was 5 days (range: 1-36 days); 2147 infants (53%) received prolonged empirical therapy (center range: 27%-85%). Infants who received prolonged therapy were less mature, had lower Apgar scores, and were more likely to be black. In multivariate analyses adjusted for these factors and center, prolonged therapy was associated with increased odds of necrotizing enterocolitis or death and of death. Each empirical treatment day was associated with increased odds of death, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the composite measure of necrotizing enterocolitis or death.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the following questions:\n1.

The purpose of this study was to examine this effect in terms of morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\nContext 2: There were 64 patients identified as having undergone sleeve resection for non-small cell lung cancer. Of the 64 total patients, 43 did not receive concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [NCR] versus 21 patients who did [CRS]. All of the CRS patients underwent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation (range, 2,000 to 6,100 cGy). Thirteen patients (62%) were downstaged, with 4 complete responders. The 90-day mortality was 2.7% (2 patients) in the NCR group and 0% in the CRS group. The incidence of major complications in the NCR group was 46.5% (20 of 43) with 4.7% (2 of 43) anastomosis-related complications (stenosis, 1; bronchovascular fistula, 1). The incidence of major complications in the CRS group was 42.9% (9 of 21) with no anastomosis-related problems. Five-year survival in the NCR group was 48% compared with 41% in the CRS group (p = 0.63). There were 9% (4 of 43) of patients with local recurrence in the NCR group versus 10% (2 of 21) of patients in the CRS group (p = 0.65).\nContext 3: Clinical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing sleeve lobectomy between 1983 and 2008 were reviewed for age, sex, type of sleeve resection, clinicopathologic TNM stage, complications, and 90-day mortality. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens were recorded for the patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared.\nContext 4: A total of 485 patients were included in this study; 425 patients (88%) underwent a sphincter-saving anterior resection/low anterior resection, 47 (10%) abdominoperineal resection, and 13 (2%) multivisceral resection. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed in 100 patients (21%). The 90-day mortality was 0.2% (1 of 485). The 5-year survival rate was 70% (95% confidence interval, 63% to 77%). The 5-year survival rate was 70% (95% confidence interval, 63% to 77%) in patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and 75% (95% confidence interval, 65% to 83%) in patients who did receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.03).\nContext 5: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on the results of sleeve lobectomy in patients with non", "Question: Is carotid artery stiffness related to endothelial function in young healthy subjects??\nExplanation: The carotid artery is the main conduit artery for blood flow to the brain.

This is because 5-FU decreases the number of viable cells in the anastomosis, which decreases the strength of the anastomosis.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Patients with gastric or esophageal surgery and transection of the vagus nerve may suffer from appetite and weight loss but without dysphagia or mechanical obstruction to eating. The gastric hormone ghrelin stimulates food intake and GH release in rodents and man. However, rodents with vagotomy are not sensitive to the feeding effects of ghrelin.\nContext 2: Twenty-two patients underwent esophagectomy including gastric reconstruction. Serum ghrelin levels and weight were measured preoperatively and then postoperatively for 12 months in all patients. A questionnaire assessed appetite, amount of food eaten, satisfaction, and frequency of eating.\nContext 3: The objective of the study was to determine whether humans with vagotomy are sensitive to ghrelin.\nContext 4: Preoperatively, the mean serum ghrelin level was 67.9 \u00b1 42.6 (fmol/mL \u00b1 SD), and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery were 43.4 \u00b1 28.1, 51.5 \u00b1 32.2, 67.1 \u00b1 50.9, and 84.9 \u00b1 43.1, respectively. Compared with preoperative values, the mean body mass index decreased by 1.9 \u00b1 1.5, 2.3 \u00b1 1.8, 2.1 \u00b1 2.3, 2.4 \u00b1 2.7 at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. While appetite score showed a decrease at 1 month (1.6 \u00b1 0.92), appetite increased by 12 months postoperatively (2.7 \u00b1 1.0) and showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.743) with serum ghrelin levels. There were no significant differences in ghrelin levels when patients were stratified by disease stage, recurrence, or administration of adjuvant chemotherapy.\nContext 5: Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach and stimulates food intake. Obese individuals have lower fasting plasma ghrelin levels but increased appetite, suggesting greater responses to endogenous ghrelin in obesity. The aim of this study was to compare effects of exogenous ghrelin (at a dose that stimulates growth hormone [GH] release in the physiologic range) versus placebo on gastric emptying, gastric volume, and postprandial symptoms and determine whether body mass (BMI) is a predictor of response to ghrelin.\nContext 6: The study was conducted in 20 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy and gastric reconstruction. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5 mg/kg of ghrelin or placebo. The patients were evaluated before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.\nContext 7: The results showed that the ghrelin group had a significantly shorter gastric emptying time (P = 0.001) and a significantly higher gastric volume (P = 0.001) than the placebo group. The ghrelin group also had a significantly higher postprandial satiety score (P =", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Sixty-four patients (48 men and 16 women) aged 64 +/- 10 years who were undergoing primary coronary artery bypass surgery were prospectively studied. Forty-one patients were treated with either subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily (n = 21; enoxaparin group) or intravenous heparin (n = 20; heparin group). Patients received the last dose of enoxaparin 8.7 +/- 0.75 hours (range, 8-10 hours) before skin incision. Heparin was stopped before transfer to the operating room. An additional 23 consecutive patients who received neither enoxaparin nor heparin served as controls (n = 23). Anti-factor Xa activity, a measure of enoxaparin and heparin activity, was measured at the start of the operation in all patients.\nContext 2: Platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, are associated with increased bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. We investigated the impact of time between the last intake of aspirin and clopidogrel before CABG surgery and drainage loss, transfusion requirements and rate of reoperation.\nContext 3: Bleeding after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is associated with a significant increase in mortality. Even though aprotinin significantly reduces bleeding in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, its use has been recently substantially limited because of serious cardiovascular complications. The exact mechanism of its action, particularly its effect on platelet function, remains unclear.\nContext 4: The effects of preoperative aspirin (ASA) and/or heparin therapy on perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were studied in patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery using perioperative blood cell salvaging techniques.\nContext 5: In 2010 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) released guidelines on venous thromboembolism. Strategy focused on risk assessment, antiembolic stockings, sequential compression devices, subcutaneous high dose enoxaparin (40 mg), early mobilisation and hydration.

Of these, 96 had favorable histology disease and are the focus of this analysis. Twenty-two patients had a primary liver resection (wedge resection, 18 and lobectomy, 4). After chemotherapy and/or radiation, 13 patients underwent liver resection (wedge resection, 7; lobectomy, 5; and trisegmentectomy, 1). Seventy-one patients (67%) did not undergo surgery for their liver disease. In 14 patients, the liver disease disappeared with chemotherapy only. Eighty-two patients received abdominal radiation. EFS for the patients with metastatic FH Wilms tumor was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: (71%, 78%), EFS by Stage IV category was: lung only 76% (95% CI: 72%, 80%) (513 patients); liver, not lung 76% (95% CI: 58%, 87%) (34 patients), liver and lung 70% (95% CI: 57%, 80%) (62 patients), and other sites 64% (95% CI: 42%, 79%) (25 patients). There were no significant differences among stage IV groups (P = 0.60). EFS (95% CI) for the patients with primary resection of the liver metastases (22 patients) was 86% (63%, 95%) compared with 68% (56%, 78%) (P = 0.09) for the 74 with no primary resection of liver metastases. There was no significant difference in EFS for patients with FH Wilms tumor treated with chemotherapy compared with that of patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation (P = 0.63). The EFS (95% CI) for each of the subsets was; no abdominal radiation: 64% (34%, 83%); abdominal radiation, no boost: 77% (55%, 89%); abdominal radiation, boost: 72% (58%, 82%) (P = 0.05).\nContext 3: We reviewed patients with stage IV Wilms tumor treated on National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) 4 and 5.

The odds ratio for the risk of gastric cancer in VacA seropositives was 0.89 (95% CI 0.46-1.74). In H. pylori seropositive patients and their control subjects (matched H. pylori-positive controls), VacA seropositivity was the same 80.6% (50/62). The odds ratio for the risk of gastric cancer in H. pylori-positive patients if VacA seropositive was 1.00 (95% CI 0.41-2.44). The mean relative intensity of VacA antibody titre was 3.01+/-0.18 in the 55 VacA seropositive cancer patients and 3.09+/-0.17 in the 57 VacA seropositive control subjects (difference not significant).\nContext 2: Infection with Helicobacter pylori strains producing vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) is associated with enhanced gastric mucosal damage and the development of gastric mucosal atrophy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether VacA seropositivity is associated with increasing risk of gastric cancer in Japanese populations which have much higher incidence of gastric cancer than Western populations.\nContext 3: While identified frequencies of genotypes, haplotypes and haplotype pairs corresponded to those of other studies in Caucasians, none were significantly associated with the presence of gastric cancer or premalignant alterations.\nContext 4: In Japan, infection with cagA-positive H. pylori is not associated with gastric cancer unlike Western populations. Both cagE and Agrobacterium VirD4 homologue are genes inside the cagPAI. The aim of this study was to examine whether the presence of genes inside the cagPAI, cagA, cagE and Agrobacterium VirD4 homologue, is associated with gastric cancer in Japan.\nContext 5: Sixty patients with gastric cancer and 60 with duodenal ulcer were studied. The alleles at positions -174 and -597 were closely linked (-174G/-597G or -174C/-597A) regardless of the ethnic group or disease presentation. There was no difference in the allele frequency at any of the sites among patient groups. The -174G allele was associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer in Japanese patients (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.9). The -597G allele was associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer in Japanese patients (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.9). The -597A allele was associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer in Japanese patients (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.9). The -597A allele was associated with a lower risk of gastric cancer in Japanese patients (odds ratio 0.5, 95% confidence", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Of the 303 chronic hepatitis C patients, 153 (50.5%) showed scarce hepatic AKR1B10 expression, quantified as 0%, which was similar to the expression in control normal liver tissues. However, the remaining 150 patients (49.5%) exhibited various degrees of AKR1B10 expression in the liver, with a maximal AKR1B10 expression of 73%. During the median follow-up time of 3.6 years (range 1.0-10.0 years), 8/303 patients developed HCC. Multivariate analysis revealed that only high AKR1B10 expression (\u2265 8%) was an independent risk factor for HCC development (HR = 15.4, 95%CI: 1.8-132.5, P = 0.012). The 5-year cumulative incidences of HCC development were 13.7% and 0.5% in patients with high and low AKR1B10 expression, respectively (P < 0.001). During the follow-up period after viral eradication, patients expressing high levels of AKR1B10 expressed markedly higher levels of alanine aminotransferase and \u03b1-fetoprotein than did patients exhibiting low AKR1B10 expression.\nContext 2: In this study, we enrolled 303 chronic hepatitis C patients who had achieved sustained virological response (SVR) through interferon-based antiviral therapy. Pretreatment AKR1B10 expression in the liver was immunohistochemically assessed and quantified as a percentage of positive staining area by using image-analysis software. A multivariate Cox analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of AKR1B10 expression for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after achieving SVR. The cumulative incidences of HCC development were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test.\nContext 3: To clarify the association between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and hepatocarcinogenesis after hepatitis C virus eradication.\nContext 4: For patients with chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV), factors predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) other than high levels of HBV-DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are needed to prevent HCC development, as many patients with HBV-related HCC have low levels of HBV-DNA and ALT.\nContext 5: To clarify the association between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and hepatocarcinogenesis after hepatitis C virus eradication.\nContext 6: To clarify the association between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and hepatocarcinogenesis after hepatitis C virus eradication.\nContext 7: To clarify the association between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and hepatocarcinogenesis after hepatitis C virus eradication.\nContext 8:", "No, the MHC2TA-168A>G (rs3087456), 1614C>G (", "Question: Is the beta form of the estrogen receptor predominantly expressed in the papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas??\nExplanation: The beta form of the estrogen receptor (ER) is expressed in the majority of human breast cancers, but not in normal breast tissue.

In privately insured children, comparable rates were 0.50 (95% CI 0.49-0.52), 0.10 (95% CI 0.10-0.11), and 0.59 (95% CI 0.58-0.61). In 1 year, children diagnosed with tic disorders also frequently received other psychiatric disorder diagnoses. Compared with privately insured youth, children under Medicaid diagnosed with Tourette disorder had higher rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (50.2% versus 25.9%), other disruptive behavior (20.6% versus 5.6%), and depression (14.6% versus 9.8%) diagnoses and higher rates of antipsychotic medication use (53.6% versus 33.2%).\nContext 3: Imaging studies of patients with Tourette's syndrome (TS) across different cohorts have shown alterations in gray and white matter in areas associated with the cortico-striato-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) pathways; however, no consistent findings have subsequently established a clear indication of the pathophysiology of TS.\nContext 4: We recruited 279 patients diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and their parents for the study. Genotyping for CARD8 rs2043211 single-nucleotide polymorphism was performed using predesigned TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assay. The genetic contribution of this single-nucleotide polymorphism was evaluated using transmission disequilibrium test and haplotype relative risk and the haplotype-based haplotype relative risk.\nContext 5: We investigated the recently proposed hypothesis that the A1 allele of the Taq I polymorphic system at the D2 dopamine receptor gene (DRD2) influences the severity of Tourette syndrome (TS). We found that the A1 allele of DRD2 was associated with a lower risk of TS in a large sample of patients with TS (n = 279) and their parents (n = 1,000). The A1 allele was associated with a lower risk of TS in patients with TS (odds ratio [OR] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.88) and their parents (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.88).

We hypothesized that C4d staining in 1-h post-reperfusion biopsies (1-h Bx) could detect early complement activation in the renal allograft due to preformed donor-specific antibodies.\nContext 2: The aim of the study was to search for serologic, immunopathologic, and morphologic evidence of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) among patients with acute renal allograft dysfunction. The study included 19 patients with episodes of acute rejection (ARE) within the first year after transplantation. All patients had negative crossmatch tests before transplantation. Patients underwent biopsy for histologic and C4d examinations. All patients were monitored for donor-specific HLA alloantibodies during the first posttransplant year. Complement-dependent cytotoxic crossmatches were performed with donor lymphocytes. In eight patients, the crossmatch test results changed to positive during ARE. In all biopsies except one with cortical infarction, we observed C4d staining (group 1). The biopsies of four patients showed histologic changes of AMR, and all of their grafts were lost. In one patient, cellular and vascular rejection (Banff II) were present; in two, Banff I; and in one, borderline lesions. These results were compared with 11 patients with ARE but negative posttransplant crossmatches and negative staining for C4d (group 2). The histologic findings in the biopsies of these patients were cellular interstitial and vascular rejection (Banff I and Banff II). With no features suggestive of AMR. During the first year after transplantation, the creatinine levels of group 1 patients, were significantly higher than group 2 patients. One-year graft survival was 50% in group 1 and 91% in group 2.\nContext 3: To test this hypothesis, renal transplants (n = 229) performed between June 2005 and December 2007 were entered into a prospective study of 1-h Bx and stained for C4d by immunofluorescence. Transplants were performed against a negative T-cell CDC-XM with the exception of three cases with a positive B-cell XM.\nContext 4: Recent studies indicate that not all low-level preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are associated with acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).

The mean surgical time (standard deviation) is 96 min (63). Results have shown that the homogeneity of operating time and DM costs was quite good per surgical procedure. The correlation between the surgical time and DM costs is not high (r = 0.65).\nContext 3: There are few published ERAS cost-analyses in colorectal surgery. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether costs saved by reduced postoperative resource utilisation would offset the financial burden of setting up and maintaining such an ERAS programme.\nContext 4: Out of 70 195 anesthesia services rendered to 32 267 patients in one-year period, 47% were general anesthesia, 23% were local anesthesia, and 30% were anesthetic procedures. Our results of highly significant association between personnel costs (r = 0.980, p = 0.000) and consumption of anesthetics and drugs (r = 0.885, p = 0.000) with the direct costs do not provide an opportunity for further cost reduction due to disassociation of direct costs and the \"unit price\" of National Health Insurance issued in terms of the restricted maximum budget for health.\nContext 5: From 7:00 am the working day before surgery through the day of surgery, 9.7% \u00b1 0.6% of scheduled OR hours and 9.7% \u00b1 0.5% of cases were cancelled. Among cases performed, 9.5% \u00b1 0.5% of the scheduled hours and 9.5% \u00b1 0.5% of the cases were previously cancelled (i.e., rescheduled to a later date and then performed). Surgeons' median workloads on days with at least 1 case were 8.3 \u00b1 0.2 hours. The percentage of scheduled workload attributable to rescheduled cases was slightly less on days when the surgeon had larger than median workloads (-0.7% \u00b1 0.3%, P = 0.022).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\nThe article is about the cost of surgical procedures in the United States.

VKORC1 enzyme is the target of vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Twenty-eight rare single mutations in the VKORC1 coding sequence have been reported from resistant patients receiving unusually high doses of VKA to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.\nContext 2: It has been suggested that these mutations are responsible for the resistant phenotype, while biochemical consequences of these mutations on the VKORC1 enzyme have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the causality of the VKORC1 mutations in the resistance phenotype.\nContext 3: Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) is a critical participant in the production of active forms of reduced vitamin K and is required for modification of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Homologues of VKORC1 (VKORH) exist throughout evolution, but in bacteria they appear to function in oxidative protein folding as well as quinone reduction. In the current study we explore two questions: Do VKORHs function in the mammalian vitamin K cycle? Is the pair of loop cysteines-C43 and C51 in human VKORC1-conserved in all VKORC1s, essential for the activity of vitamin K epoxide reduction?\nContext 4: We used our recently developed cell-based assay to compare the function of VKORHs to that of human VKORC1 in mammalian cells. We identified for the first time a VKORH (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mt-VKORH]) that can function in the mammalian vitamin K cycle with vitamin K epoxide or vitamin K as substrate. Consistent with our previous in vitro results, the loop cysteines of human VKORC1 are not essential for its activity in vivo. Moreover, the corresponding loop cysteines of Mt-VKORH (C57 and C65), which are essential for its activity in disulfide bond formation during protein folding in Escherichia coli, are not required in the mammalian vitamin K cycle.\nContext 5: The genetic variations in VKORC1 modulate the stable responses to warfarin administration. But the role of VKORC1 polymorphisms during the initial anticoagulation and elimination period in the Han Chinese population is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between VKORC1 polymorphisms and the initial anticoagulation and elimination period in Han Chinese population.\nContext 6: VKORC1 polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,000 Han Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 1,000 healthy controls. The results showed that the VKORC1 rs1128503 polymorphism was associated with the initial anticoagulation period (P = 0.001) and the elimination period (P = 0.001). The rs1128503 C allele was associated with a shorter initial anticoagulation period (P = 0.001) and a shorter elimination period (P", "Yes, mycophenolate mofetil prevents salt-sensitive hypertension resulting from angiotensin II infusion.\nMycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is the prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Proton pump inhibitors impair exposure to MPA due to incomplete conversion from MMF. Lower exposure to MPA could result in an increased risk of acute rejection. We investigated whether MMF-treated renal transplant patients who concomitantly used pantoprazole as ulcer prophylaxis had a higher risk of acute rejection within the first three months after transplantation than those who used ranitidine.\nAngiotensin II (Ang II)-induced renal damage is", "Question: Do perception of the pitch and naturalness of popular music by cochlear implant users??\nExplanation: Cochlear implant recipients were significantly less accurate in recognition of previously familiar (known before hearing loss) musical excerpts than normal-hearing adults (p < 0.001) for all three genre. Implant recipients were most accurate in the recognition of country items and least accurate in the recognition of classical items. There were no significant differences among implant recipients due to implant type (Nucleus, Clarion, or Ineraid), or programming strategy (SPEAK, CIS, or ACE). For cochlear implant recipients, correlations between melody recognition and other measures were moderate to weak in strength; those with statistically significant correlations included age at", "Explanation: Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) form part of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).

The chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is expressed at sites of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Sero-epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between multiple sclerosis (MS) and prior Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. It has been hypothesized that intermittent peripheral EBV reactivation may drive continuing central inflammation. Recent investigation has shown significant differences in median serum levels of anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) IgG between disease subgroups and positive correlation with disease activity reflected by number of Gd-enhancing lesions and T2 lesion volume. These important data have led to hopes that anti-EBNA-1 IgG may be useful as an easily accessible and effective biomarker of disease activity.\nContext 2: We previously showed that serum IgG repertoires distinguished multiple sclerosis (MS) patients from healthy subjects and from patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND). We questioned whether the serum IgG repertoire of patients presenting a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) could predict MS.\nContext 3: We were unable to show a difference in quantitative analysis of serum anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels between disease subgroups and no correlation with phenotypic characteristics including age at onset (r =\u2003-0.17, P = 0.16), disease duration (r = 0.03, P = 0.78), EDSS (r = 0.03, P = 0.78) or MSSS (r = 0.02, P = 0.9). In addition, there was only moderate correlation between the two test methods used (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.67; 0.56-0.78) suggesting potential problems with test interpretation.\nContext 4: We examined the applicability of these findings in routine clinical practice, assessing a well-characterized cohort of 100 subjects (25 primary progressive, 25 stable relapsing remitting, 25 active relapsing remitting seen in acute relapse and 25 controls) for serum anti-EBNA-1 IgG using both the Liaison quantitative chemiluminescent assay and Biotest ELISA.\nContext 5: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be an efficient anti-inflammatory treatment for a growing number of neuroinflammatory diseases and protects against the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a rationale for your answer.\n    - The serum anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels of patients with CIS were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects and patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND). This suggests that serum anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels may be useful as an easily accessible and effective biomarker of disease activity in CIS.\n    - The serum anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels of patients with CIS were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects and patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIND).

Since dysregulation of IL-1 signalling is considered a pathogenic mechanism in a number of related autoinflammatory conditions, we examined the extent to which unimpeded interleukin (IL)-1 signalling influences NOD2-dependent inflammation of the eye versus the joint.\nContext 2: IL-1beta release was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in vitro, obtained from 5 Blau syndrome individuals with a NOD2 (CARD15) mutation.\nContext 3: We observed no evidence for increased IL-1beta production in cells obtained from subjects with Blau syndrome compared with healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we presented 2 cases of Blau syndrome in which recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) was ineffective treatment.\nContext 4: Blau syndrome is a rare, autosomal-dominant, autoinflammatory disorder characterized by granulomatous arthritis, uveitis, and dermatitis. Genetics studies have shown that the disease is caused by single nonsynonymous substitutions in NOD-2, a member of the NOD-like receptor or NACHT-leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family of intracellular proteins. Several NLRs function in the innate immune system as sensors of pathogen components and participate in immune-mediated cellular responses via the caspase 1 inflammasome. Mutations in a gene related to NOD-2, NLRP3, are responsible for excess caspase 1-dependent interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in cryopyrinopathies such as Muckle-Wells syndrome. Furthermore, functional studies demonstrate that caspase 1-mediated release of IL-1beta also involves NOD-2. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that IL-1beta may mediate the inflammation seen in patients with Blau syndrome.\nContext 5: Mice deficient for IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) were administered the NOD2 agonist muramyl dipeptide (MDP) by systemic (intraperitoneal) or local (intraocular and/or intra-articular) injections. NOD2-deficient mice received an intraocular injection of recombinant IL-1\u03b2. Uveitis was evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy and histopathology. Joint inflammation was evaluated by histopathology and radiography.\nContext 6: We observed that IL-1\u03b2 was released in response to MDP in NOD2-deficient mice. Intraocular injection of recombinant IL-1\u03b2 induced uveitis in NOD2-deficient mice. Intra-articular injection of recombinant IL-1\u03b2 induced arthritis in NOD2-deficient mice. These findings suggest that IL-1\u03b2 is a key mediator of NOD2-dependent inflammation in Blau syndrome.\nContext 7: We observed that IL-1\u03b2 was released in response to MDP in NOD2-deficient mice. Intraocular injection of recombinant IL-1\u03b2", "Question: Do human complement regulatory proteins protect swine lungs from xenogeneic injury??\nYes, human complement regulatory proteins protect swine lungs from xenogeneic injury.\nThe study evaluated complement-dependent pathways of pulmonary injury during heterologous perfusion of swine lungs. Perfusion of unmodified swine lungs with human plasma and baboon blood resulted in hyperacute lung injury within minutes of perfusion. However, function was preserved in swine lungs expressing human decay-accelerating factor and human CD59. In both study groups, xenogeneic perfusion with baboon blood resulted in at least a sevenfold increase in plasma C3a-desArg levels suggesting transient activation of complement.\nPorcine Sertoli cells have an inherent", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The hepatoma arterial-embolization prognostic (HAP) score predicts survival outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE). We validated the HAP score in Korean subjects with HCC and investigated whether its prognostic performance is improved with additional parameters.\nContext 2: Performance status is tightly linked with survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the impact of performance status on HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria receiving surgical resection (SR) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).\nContext 3: The median OS after liver resection was 62 months, with a median follow-up of 63 months. Median OS was similar between the three study groups classified by response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (complete or partial response, 58 months; stable disease, 65 months; and disease progression, 61 months; P =.98). By univariate analysis, carcinoembryonic antigen level after liver resection of <5 ng/dL, size of metastatic lesion of </=5 cm, lymph node-negative primary tumor, and disease-negative margins were associated with improved survival. Patients in the disease progression group had more positive margins and metastases >5 cm in size than patients in the complete or partial response group and the stable disease group. Patients whose tumor progressed but who received postoperative hepatic arterial infusion had a trend toward improved survival compared with those who did not receive hepatic arterial infusion (70% vs. 50% at 3 years, permutation log rank test P =.12).\nContext 4: Presently, the role of liver resection (LR) for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. However, in many regions worldwide, LR remains the only treatment modality available to such patients which offers the possibility of long-term cure. The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes and prognostic factors of patients with multifocal HCC after LR.\nContext 5: The data of 147 patients were analyzed, 79 with a solid venous tumor thrombus consistency and 68 with a friable venous tumor thrombus consistency, followed for a median period of 40.5\u2009months. Venous tumor thrombus consistency was assessed with a high interobserver agreement (145/147 cases). The presence of a friable venous tumor thrombus consistency was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (P\u2009=\u20090.001). The presence of a friable venous tumor thrombus consistency was associated with a higher risk of recurrence (P\u2009=\u20090.001).

The primary aim of this study was to investigate which core behavioral features of binge eating are most strongly related to psychological disturbance.\nContext 2: Eating disorder behaviors were assessed in consecutive general population surveys of men and women conducted in 1995 (n = 3001, 72% respondents) and 2005 (n = 3047,", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Duodenal adenomatosis in familial adenomatous polyposis results in a cancer risk that increases with age. Endoscopic surveillance has been recommended, but the effect has not yet been documented. The aim of this study was to present the results of long-term duodenal surveillance and to evaluate the risk of cancer development.\nContext 2: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at high risk of developing duodenal adenomas and carcinomas. Besides germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, additional factors may influence the age of onset and number of duodenal adenomas. This study compared the genotype distributions of duodenal detoxification enzyme isoforms in patients with FAP and controls.\nContext 3: Among 304 patients, 261 (86%) had more than one endoscopy. The median follow up was 14 (interquartile range, 9-17) years. The cumulative lifetime risk of duodenal adenomatosis was 88% (95% CI, 84-93), and of Spigelman stage IV was 35% (95% CI, 25-45). The Spigelman stage improved in 32 (12%) patients, remained unchanged in 88 (34%) and worsened in 116 (44%). Twenty (7%) patients had duodenal cancer at a median age of 56 (range, 44-82) years. The cumulative cancer incidence was 18% at 75 years of age (95% CI, 8-28) and increased with increasing Spigelman stage at the index endoscopy to 33% in Spigelman stage IV (P < 0.0001). The median overall survival was 6.4 years (95% CI, 1.7 to not estimated): 8 years after a screen-detected cancer vs 0.8 years (95% CI, 0.03-1.7) after a symptomatic cancer (P < 0.0001). The location of the mutation in the APC gene did not influence the risk of developing Spigelman stage IV (P = 0.46) or duodenal cancer (P = 0.83).\nContext 4: Those presenting for proctectomy after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis were selected.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA).\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA).\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of developing colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA).\nContext 8: The aim of", "Question: Does transfer of lipophilic markers from PLGA and polystyrene nanoparticles to caco-2 monolayers mimic particle uptake??\nYes, the transfer of lipophilic markers from PLGA and polystyrene nanoparticles to caco-2 monolayers mimics particle uptake.

Storage lesions may promote inflammation and thrombophilia when transfused. In trauma patients, RBC transfusion was an independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), specifically when RBC units were stored > 21 days or when 5 or more units were transfused. The objective of this study was to determine if RBC transfusions or RBC storage age predicts incident DVT in medical or surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients.\nContext 2: Within the cohort of eligibles with myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 5,673) there were 212 incident cases of deep vein thrombosis events. Mean age was 76.2 (standard deviation = \u00b1 8.6) years. Use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents was not associated with deep vein thrombosis in the crude nor the adjusted models (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.60, 2.43). Central venous catheter placement (OR = 6.47, 95% CI: 2.37, 17.62) and red blood cell transfusion (OR = 4.60, 95% CI: 2.29, 9.23) were associated with deep vein thrombosis.\nContext 3: It is thought that the clearance of transfused red blood cells (RBCs) is related both to the storage time of the transfusion product and to the inflammatory status of the recipient. We investigated these effects in a randomized, \"two-hit,\" healthy volunteer transfusion model, comparing autologous RBCs that were stored for 35 days with those that were stored for 2 days.\nContext 4: The primary outcome measure was the number of units of packed red blood cells transfused during hospitalization. Baseline characteristics between the treatment groups were similar. The duration of therapy for variceal hemorrhage was significantly longer in the continuous-infusion group than in the control group. Transfusion requirements for packed red blood cells (mean+/-SD 6.4+/-6.5 vs 5.8+/-6.6 units, p=0.66) and platelets (8.8+/-15.1 vs 5.1+/-11.9 units, p=0.16) were similar.

IL-6 is also known to have a role", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Resection of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) with curative intent has long-term benefit in ~40% of cases. Prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve clinical management and reduce futile surgeries. Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2; also known as cyclooxygenase-2) has been associated with carcinogenesis and survival. We investigated the prognostic value of EGFR and PTGS2 expression in patients with resected CRCLM.\nContext 2: Few studies have investigated whether the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), an inflammation-based prognostic score measured before resection of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), can predict postoperative survival.\nContext 3: Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis with anticancer effects. After minimally invasive colorectal resection (MICR), blood levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoetin 2 (Ang-2) are elevated for 2-4 weeks. Also, postoperative human plasma from weeks 2 and 3 after MICR has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are critical to angiogenesis. This proangiogenic state may stimulate tumor growth early after MICR. Surgery's impact on angiostatin and endostatin is unknown. This study's purpose is to determine perioperative plasma levels of these two proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing MICR.\nContext 4: Mutations in KRAS and BRAF genes as well as the loss of expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (deleted on chromosome 10) are associated with impaired activity of antibodies directed against epidermal growth factor receptor in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The predictive and prognostic value of the KRAS and BRAF point mutations as well as PTEN expression in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is unknown.\nContext 5: It has been reported that activating KRAS mutations negatively affect response to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer. The mutation status of signaling molecules downstream of the EGFR target is thus crucial to predict clinical response to EGFR-targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of KRAS and BRAF mutations in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of KRAS and BRAF mutations in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of KRAS and BRAF mutations in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with cetuximab", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Here, we report that the hypoxia increased the expression levels of ezrin mRNA and protein in PMFs, which might explain that the expression of cytoskeletal proteins (destrin, a1-actin, and a1-tubulin) in PMFs was significantly induced by hypoxia. After inhibiting ezrin in PMFs by siRNA transfection, we found the over-expression of cytoskeletal proteins induced by hypoxia was significantly suppressed at all time-points. Additionally, we found that hypoxia or over-expression of ezrin through adenovirus-mediated ezrin gene transfection significantly increases the proliferation and migration of PMFs, and which could be inverted by the transfection of siRNA.\nContext 2: An experimental model was used, in which fibroblasts and BOEC were subjected to hypoxia under contact and transwell conditions to determine if BOEC reduce the conversion of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts under hypoxic conditions. Gene expression under different conditions was performed. In addition, functional assays including cell proliferation and migration were determined.\nContext 3: The membrane cytoskeletal crosslinker, ezrin, a member of the ERM family of proteins, is frequently over-expressed in human breast cancers, and is required for motility and invasion of epithelial cells. Our group previously showed that ezrin acts co-operatively with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, in deregulation of cell-cell contacts and scattering of epithelial cells. In particular, ezrin phosphorylation on Y477 by Src is specific to ezrin within the ERM family, and is required for HGF-induced scattering of epithelial cells. We therefore sought to examine the role of Y477 phosphorylation in ezrin on tumor progression.\nContext 4: Hypoxic conditions cause fibroblasts to differentiate into alpha smooth-muscle cell actin (\u03b1 -SMA)-positive cells, i.e. myofibroblasts. This process is a hallmark of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH) associated with hemodialysis vascular access. The purpose of this study was to determine if blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) may reduce the conversion of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts under hypoxic conditions, and to determine the potential mechanisms involved.\nContext 5: After 96 h culture in growth medium for 2.5 and 9 h, doubling times of fibroblasts and BOEC were 24.5 and 24.0 h, respectively. After 96 h culture in growth medium for 2.5 and 9 h, doubling times of fibroblasts and BOEC were 24.5 and 24.0 h, respectively.

However, some patients with a high-PVC burden do not develop cardiomyopathy, while other patients with low-PVC burden can develop cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the positive predictors of idiopathic PVCs-induced cardiomyopathy.\nContext 2: Despite the prognostic importance of ventricular filling and ventricular-arterial interaction in patients with advanced systolic heart failure, the structural determinants of these parameters have not been fully studied. We aimed to investigate whether patterns of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance affect ventricular elastic properties or performance in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).\nContext 3: We investigated 214 patients undergoing successful ablation of PVCs who had no other causes of cardiomyopathy. We divided the study cohort into 2 groups: ejection fraction (EF) \u2265 50% (normal LV) and EF < 50% (LV dysfunction). We analyzed the clinical characteristics, including the electrocardiogram and findings at electrophysiology study. Among these patients, 51 (24%) had reduced LVEF and 163 (76%) had normal LV function. Patients with LV dysfunction had significantly longer coupling interval (CI) dispersion (maximum-CI-minimum-CI) and had significantly higher PVC burden compared to those with normal LV function (CI-dispersion: 115 \u00b1 25 milliseconds vs. 94 \u00b1 19 milliseconds; P < 0.001; PVC burden: 19% vs. 15%; P = 0.04). Furthermore, patients with LV dysfunction had significantly higher body mass index (BMI) compared to those with normal LV function (BMI > 30 kg/m(2) ; 37% vs. 13%; P = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that CI-dispersion, PVC burden, and BMI (>30\u00a0kg/m(2) ) are independent predictors of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.\nContext 4: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies evaluating the effect of DFT testing on total mortality and ventricular arrhythmias during follow-up. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects modeling.\nContext 5: Notwithstanding its clinical use, the prognostic value of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the ECG in patients with DCM.\nContext 6: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).\nContext 7: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).\nContext 8: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with dilated cardi", "Question: Is routine duodenal biopsy to screen for coeliac disease effective??\nYes, it is effective.

The accessibility of smokers' norms for smoking-how quickly they bring to mind social support for smoking-predicted their peripheral processing of the ads, and imbued resistance to persuasion. In contrast, non-smokers' attitude and norm accessibility were unrelated to ad processing.\nContext 2: In a repeated measures design, the accessibility of smokers' (N = 70) and non-smokers' (N = 96) attitudes toward", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Several genes were associated with the alcohol-related phenotypes at the genome-wide significance level, with the ankyrin repeat domain 7 gene (ANKRD7) showing the strongest statistical evidence for regular alcohol drinking and suggestive statistical evidence for alcohol consumption. In addition, certain haplotypes within the ANKRD7 and cytokine-like1 (CYTL1) genes were significantly associated with regular drinking behavior, such as one ANKRD7 block composed of the SNPs rs6466686-rs4295599-rs12531086 (P = 6.51 \u00d7 10(-8)). The association of alcohol consumption was successfully replicated with rs4295599 in ANKRD7 gene in independent Caucasian nuclear families and independent unrelated Chinese Hans, and with rs16836497 in CYTL1 gene in independent unrelated Caucasians. Meta-analyses based on both the GWAS and replication samples further supported the observed significant associations between the ANKRD7 or CYTL1 gene and alcohol consumption.\nContext 2: A previous genome-wide linkage study of alcohol dependence in multiplex families found a suggestive linkage result for a region on Chromosome 1 near microsatellite markers D1S196 and D1S2878. The KIAA0040 gene has been mapped to this region (1q24 - q25). A recent genome-wide association study using SAGE (the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment) and COGA (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism) found five SNPs within the KIAA0040 gene significantly associated with alcohol dependence. A meta-analysis using data from these sources also found the KIAA0040 gene significantly associated with alcohol dependence.\nContext 3: We previously reported a risk genomic region (ie, PTP4A1-PHF3-EYS) for alcohol dependence in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We also reported a rare variant constellation across this region that was significantly associated with alcohol dependence. In the present study, we significantly increased the marker density within this region and examined the specificity of the associations of common variants for alcohol dependence.\nContext 4: A genome-wide association study with the behavior of regular alcohol drinking and alcohol consumption was performed to identify susceptibility genes associated with AD, using the Affymetrix 500K SNP array in an initial sample consisting of 904 unrelated Caucasian subjects. Then, the initial results in GWAS were replicated in three independent samples: 1972 Caucasians in 593 nuclear families, 2000 Caucasians in 1000 unrelated individuals, and 2000 Chinese in 1000 unrelated individuals.

The decidua is composed of a mixture of cells, including decidual cells, macrophages, and NK cells. NK cells are a subset of lymphocytes that are involved in the immune response. NK cells are characterized by their ability to recognize and kill cells that are infected with viruses or cancer cells. In the decidua, NK cells are activated and can become LAK cells. LAK cells are a type of lymphocyte", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Given the considerable geographic overlap in the endemic regions for malaria and tuberculosis, it is probable that co-infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium species are prevalent. Thus, it is quite likely that both malaria and TB vaccines may be used in the same populations in endemic areas. While novel vaccines are currently being developed and tested individually against each of these pathogens, the efficacy of these vaccines has not been evaluated in co-infection models. To further assess the effectiveness of these new immunization strategies, we investigated whether co-infection with malaria would impact the anti-tuberculosis protection induced by four different types of TB vaccines in a mouse model of pulmonary tuberculosis.\nContext 2: Here we show that the anti-tuberculosis protective immunity induced by four different tuberculosis vaccines was not impacted by a concurrent infection with Plasmodium yoelii NL, a nonlethal form of murine malaria. After an aerogenic challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis, the lung bacterial burdens of vaccinated animals were not statistically different in malaria infected and malaria na\u00efve mice. Multi-parameter flow cytometric analysis showed that the frequency and the median fluorescence intensities (MFI) for specific multifunctional T (MFT) cells expressing IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and/or IL-2 were suppressed by the presence of malaria parasites at 2 weeks following the malaria infection but was not affected after parasite clearance at 7 and 10 weeks post-challenge with P. yoelii NL.\nContext 3: Studies in West Africa and elsewhere have suggested that Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine given at birth is beneficial for child survival. It is possible that this effect is mediated partly through an effect on malaria, a hypothesis supported by animal studies. We investigated whether revaccination with BCG at 19 months of age reduced morbidity from malaria.\nContext 4: In the capital of Guinea-Bissau, between January and November 2003, children who had previously received BCG vaccination and who did not have a strong reaction to tuberculin were individually randomised to either receive revaccination with BCG at the age of 19 months or to be a control. Episodes of malaria were recorded during the 2003 malaria transmission season through passive case detection at health centres in the study area and at the national hospital. Cross-sectional surveys were carried out at the beginning and at the end of the rainy season.\nContext 5: Immunogenicity of BCG was assessed in 1,000 children aged 19 months, who had received BCG at birth and who had not previously had a strong reaction to tuberculin. The children were randomly assigned to receive revaccination with BCG at 19 months of age or to be a control. The children were followed up for 2 years. The incidence of malaria was recorded during the 2003 malaria transmission season through passive case detection at health centres in the study area and at the national hospital.

The PI 3-K pathway is activated by the binding of the bile acid, taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), to the bile acid receptor, the bile acid receptor (BARS). The activated PI 3-K pathway inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K)-dependent", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The transcription factor GATA3 is a favorable prognostic indicator in estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1)-positive breast tumors in which it participates with ER\u03b1 and FOXA1 in a complex transcriptional regulatory program driving tumor growth. GATA3 mutations are frequent in breast cancer and have been classified as driver mutations. To elucidate the contribution(s) of GATA3 alterations to cancer, we studied two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, which carries a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the second zinc finger of GATA3, and T47D, wild-type at this locus.\nContext 2: GATA3 localized in the nucleus in T47D and MCF7 cells, regardless of the mutation status. The truncated protein in MCF7 had impaired interaction with chromatin and was easily released from the nucleus. Recombinant mutant GATA3 was able to bind DNA to a lesser degree than the wild-type protein. Heterozygosity for the truncating mutation conferred protection from regulated turnover of GATA3, ER\u03b1 and FOXA1 following estrogen stimulation in MCF7 cells. Thus, mutant GATA3 uncoupled protein-level regulation of master regulatory transcription factors from hormone action. Consistent with increased protein stability, ChIP-seq profiling identified greater genome-wide accumulation of GATA3 in MCF7 cells bearing the mutation, albeit with a similar distribution across the genome, comparing to T47D cells.\nContext 3: Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation were employed to verify cellular localization of GATA3 in T47D and MCF7 cells. To test protein stability, cells were treated with translation inhibitor, cycloheximide or proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and GATA3 abundance was measured over time using immunoblot. GATA3 turn-over in response to hormone was determined by treating the cells with estradiol or ER\u03b1 agonist, ICI 182,780. DNA binding ability of recombinant GATA3 was evaluated using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and heparin chromatography. Genomic location of GATA3 in MCF7 and T47D cells was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq).\nContext 4: Analysis of gene expression following knockdown of Sin3A revealed changes in both basal and regulated gene transcription. Genes of known importance in breast cancer and estrogen signaling, including ER\u03b1, FOXA1, GATA3, and GATA4, were identified. GATA3 was found to be a direct target of Sin3A in MCF7 cells. GATA3 was also found to be a direct target of Sin3A in T47D cells. GATA3 was found to be a direct target of Sin3A in MCF7 cells. GATA3 was found to be a direct target of Sin3A in T47D cells.

Differences will manifest as either increased or decreased coherence values in certain frequency bands, with EEG localization at primary sensorimotor cortex and/or supplementary motor area (SMA).", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To examine the role of heparin in modulating neutrophil activation and release of cytokine.\nContext 2: Postinjury neutrophil (PMN) priming identifies the injured patient at risk for the subsequent development of multiple organ failure (MOF). PMN priming has previously been shown to cause enhanced release of proteases and superoxide. PMNs, however, are a rich source of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which have been implicated in the development of MOF. PMNs also make IL-1ra, which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits IL-1. It is our hypothesis that postinjury PMNs are primed for increased stimulated release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra.\nContext 3: Postinjury PMNs were primed for both platelet-activating factor/N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL-8 and TNF release at 2 hours after injury (fourfold increase of IL-8 release and fivefold increase of TNF release), whereas elective surgical patients demonstrated no priming. In contrast, postinjury patients were not primed for increased release of the counterinflammatory cytokine IL-1ra, suggesting a specific postinjury up-regulation of IL-8 and TNF.\nContext 4: Treatment with DHA increased the secretion of interleukin(IL)-1|*alpha*| by CF neutrophils, but the secretion of other cytokines, CD11b expression, and arachidonic acid (AA) release were not affected either in CF or control (CT) neutrophils. Both with and without DHA, only one out of eight CF neutrophils responded to LPS with an increase of released AA, while five out of seven CT cells released more AA (CF vs. CT P < 0.05 by Fisher test).\nContext 5: Blood transfusion has repeatedly been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF). Previously believed to represent a surrogate for shock, packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion has recently been shown to result in neutrophil priming and pulmonary endothelial cell activation. We have previously observed that neutrophil priming is associated with increased release of IL-8 and TNF, and that this priming is associated with increased risk for MOF. We hypothesized that transfusion of PRBCs would result in increased release of IL-8 and TNF and that this would be associated with increased risk for MOF.\nContext 6: We have previously demonstrated that neutrophil priming is associated with increased release of IL-8 and TNF, and that this priming is associated with increased risk for MOF. We hypothesized that transfusion of PRBCs would result in increased release of IL-8 and TNF and that this would be associated with increased risk for MOF.\nContext 7: We have", "Yes, it is a rare disease.

This may be caused by a decrease of endogenous galactose production with ageing. Alternatively, suppression of endogenous galactose production by exogenous galactose might be implicated. The aim of this study was to determine if the rate of appearance of galactose is suppressed by exogenous galactose.\nContext 2: Two adult patients with classical galactosemia and three healthy control subjects were given a primed continuous infusion of D-[1-13C]galactose to determine the rate of appearance of galactose (GAR, expressed as micromol/kg/h) before and during additional galactose supplementation. After initial assessment of GAR (GAR1), GAR was determined during doubled (GAR2) or quadrupled (GAR4) galactose infusion.\nContext 3: Galactose consumption as the only carbohydrate source results in little increase in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations when compared with fasting. Lower insulin might promote endogenous lipolysis during meal absorption, which may facilitate fat loss.\nContext 4: Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) and those of glycerol, palmitate, free fatty acids, and triglycerides were higher (P < 0.05) during galactose than during glucose feeding in both nonlactating and lactating women. During galactose feeding, glucose Ra was lower (P < 0.01) and glycerol, palmitate, and free fatty acid Ra were higher (P < 0.01) in both groups. During galactose feeding in all women combined, fat oxidation was higher (P = 0.01) and protein oxidation was lower (P < 0.01). Milk production, energy expenditure, and carbohydrate oxidation were similar between glucose and galactose feeding.\nContext 5: The objective was to test the hypothesis that consumption of an isocaloric, isonitrogenous galactose drink will result in higher rates of lipolysis and fat oxidation than consumption of a glucose drink in obese lactating and nonlactating women.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does short-term exogenous galactose supplementation influence rate of appearance of galactose (GAR) in adult patients with classical galactosemia?\nContext 1: Recently, evidence has been presented that adult patients with classical galactosemia have higher than expected galactose tolerance.

Mice were administered SB216763 at 2 h before or after D-GalN/LPS injection, respectively, and then sacrificed 6 h after D-GalN/LPS treatment to evaluate its prophylactic and therapeutic function. The lethality rate, liver damage, ERS, cytokine expression, MAP kinase, hepatocyte apoptosis and expression of TLR 4 were evaluated, respectively. Whether the inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 activation protected hepatocyte from ERS-induced apoptosis was investigated in vitro.\nContext 2: GSK3\u03b2 became quickly activated (dephosphorylated) upon D-GalN/LPS exposure. Administration of SB216763 not only ameliorated liver injury, as evidenced by reduced transaminase levels, and well-preserved liver architecture, but also decreased lethality. Moreover, GSK3\u03b2 inhibition resulted in down-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins C/EBP-homologous protein(CHOP) and caspase-12, which are related to ERS. To further demonstrate the role of ERS, we found that GSK3\u03b2 inhibition protected hepatocyte from ERS-induced cell death. GSK3\u03b2 inhibition down-regulated the MAPK pathways, reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines and decreased expression of TLR4.\nContext 3: To analyze the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) in hepatocyte apoptosis induced by oxidative stress.\nContext 4: Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2(GSK3\u03b2) is a ubiquitous serine-threonine protein kinase that participates in numerous cellular processes and disease pathophysiology. We aimed to determine therapeutic potential of GSK3\u03b2 inhibition and its mechanism in a well-characterized model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of acute liver failure (ALF).\nContext 5: The current model for JNK activation by SFA involves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which induces JNK activation through an inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1\u03b1) Apoptosis Regulating Kinase 1 (ASK1)-dependent mechanism. Here, we find that the ER stress-induced JNK activation is mediated by the IRE1\u03b1-ASK1-ATF4 pathway, which is independent of the ER stress-induced activation of the JNK pathway. We also find that the ER stress-induced JNK activation is mediated by the IRE1\u03b1-ASK1-ATF4 pathway, which is independent of the ER stress-induced activation of the JNK pathway.

Recently, a functional polymorphism in the promoter of the CD14 gene (CD14-260C>T) was found to be associated with coronary heart disease. We examined if this polymorphism was associated with sub-clinical carotid atherosclerosis in a community population.\nContext 2: It is uncertain whether the novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have recently been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in genome-wide studies also influence carotid atheroma and stroke risk. The mechanisms of their association with CAD are unknown; relationships to other cardiovascular phenotypes may give mechanistic clues. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a subclinical marker of atherosclerosis associated with stroke. We investigated association of reported CAD risk variants with CIMT, and with other intermediate phenotypes that may implicate causative pathways.\nContext 3: Though the associations of CD14 with asthma have already been studied, the results of different independent studies are in conflict, mostly due to differences in the pathogenesis of varying asthma sub-phenotypes. The aim of our study was to perform an association analysis of promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -159C/T (rs2569190) in the CD14 gene for Slovenian children with asthma.\nContext 4: We evaluated the relationship between variants of the PAF-AH gene polymorphisms Arg92His, Ile198Thr, and Ala379Val and the presence of carotid atherosclerosis in 190 hypercholesterolemic Sicilian individuals. Carotid artery intima-media wall thickness (IMT) was measured as an indicator of early atherosclerotic disease. The participants were classified according to having normal (< or =1 mm) or abnormal (> or =1 mm) IMT and were also investigated for physical characteristics and biochemical indices, including PAF-AH activity.\nContext 5: An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the gene for angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) is associated with ACE plasma levels and activity. Conflicting results have been reported about the relevance of this polymorphism for atherosclerotic vascular disease. The aim of the present study was to analyze the role of this polymorphism for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no. If yes, explain why. If no, explain why not.\n\nThe CD14-260C>T polymorphism is associated with coronary heart disease.

The context 1 is about the management of large and deep heel ulcers (LDHUs) in patients with diabetic foot lesions. The context 2 is about the management of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that lack clinical signs of infection. The context 3 is about the Eurodiale study. The context 4 is about the management of LDHUs. The context 5 is about the management of neuropathic DFUs. The answer is yes because the context 1 and 2 are related to the question. The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Pneumothorax remains the most common complication of percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy, despite improved techniques. The rate of pneumothorax reported in the literature ranges from 19 to 60%. The aims of this study were to estimate the risk of pneumothorax in patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsy, and to determine which factors affect its occurrence.\nContext 2: Seventy-seven patients (26.6%) had pneumothorax after percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy. Forty-one of the 77 patients (53.2%) who had pneumothorax (14.2% of the entire series) required placement of a chest tube. Our present study, using multivariate logistic regression analysis, confirmed that greater lesion depth, wider trajectory angle, and increasing FVC percent predicted are independent risk factors of pneumothorax, and that two former factors are independent risk factors of chest tube placement following percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy.\nContext 3: It can be difficult to perform CT guided biopsy of small pulmonary nodules especially if the position is behind a costa or close to the diaphragm and respiratory movements may hamper the procedure. During apneic oxygenation with a pulmonary standstill these movements can be hindered.\nContext 4: Six patients with decreased lung function and suspicious lung nodules are presented. Under general anesthesia including a muscle relaxant and a cuffed tube in the trachea CT guided biopsy was prepared. Just before the biopsy the ventilation mode was switched to a continuous positive airway pressure of 5-10\u00a0cm H2O, maintaining 100% oxygen delivery without ventilation. If the position of the lung nodule was inconvenient for biopsy the pressure was increased to up to 17\u00a0cm H2O to expand the lungs to a better biopsy position. After retrieving the biopsy controlled ventilation was re-established and a finishing control CT-scan was performed. Blood gas analyses were performed with few minutes interval.\nContext 5: Data from standardized procedure notes and postprocedure chest radiographs were extracted and individually reviewed to verify the presence of pneumothorax or misplacement, and any intervention performed for either complication. The overall success rate of ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement was 96.9% with an average of 1.3 attempts. There was only one pneumothorax (0.1% [95% CI, 0-0.4%]), and no misplacement of the catheter. The overall success rate of ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement was 96.9% with an average of 1.3 attempts. There was only one pneumothorax (0.1% [95% CI, 0-0.4%]), and no misplacement of the catheter.\nContext 6: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study included 20 patients with ARDS who were treated with ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement.

However, we have encountered patients with such symptoms and excessive tachycardia but with no symptoms during the tilt-table test (TTT). We aimed to investigate whether POTS patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance always present orthostatic symptoms during the TTT and analyze the factors underlying symptom manifestation during this test.\nContext 3: The response rate was 90%. Mean age of patients was 47.3 years (SD 16.5); 51% were women. Expectations were high but varied according to the nature and severity of the condition. The percentage of patients wanting the doctor alone to make decisions ranged from 50% for \"family problem\" to 68% for \"chest pain\". The five factorial structures differed and explained 49.3-63.9% of the variance. Similarities were observed depending on the type of problem. \"Communication\" and \"Experience of disease\" were thus separate dimensions for the biomedical diseases but mixed for the psychosocial conditions.\nContext 4: Twenty-two patients with SCA and 15 healthy (AA) children/adolescents participated to the study. Heart rate variability was measured in supine position and after a tilt-test to quantify the ANS activity. PA energy expenditure (PAEE) was assessed with questionnaire.\nContext 5: Follow-up data were obtained from 47 patients. Of them, 45 (96%) had ischemic cardiomyopathy, 38 (81%) had New York Heart Association class I-II, 43 (91%) were males, and the mean age was 68.6 +/- 11.1 years. During follow-up, 5 patients (11%) had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), 6 patients (13%) had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and 36 patients (76%) had no events. The circulating biomarkers' levels upon enrollment were not significantly different between patients who subsequently had NSVT or VT/VF and patients who were free of events.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes or no.\n\n1.

Whether progestin antagonism is responsible for these negative results or the natural estrogen 17ss-estradial (E2) itself is not effective in the coronary circulation is unknown.\nContext 2: Nineteen postmenopausal women with typical hormone profiles were crossover randomized to 300 micro g nasal 17beta-estradiol (Aerodiol, Servier, Chambray-les-Tours, France) or an identical placebo at least 5 days apart. Both time domain and frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were obtained during controlled respiration (CR) and handgrip exercise (HGE), before and 45 min after 17beta-estradiol or placebo administration.\nContext 3: Long-term estrogen replacement therapy has favorable results on autonomic cardiovascular functions in postmenopausal women. Although acute estrogen administration has beneficial modulations on autonomic tone in animal studies, there are still controversies about the effects of acute estrogen on autonomic modulation to the heart in humans. The aim of this double-blind study was to investigate the acute effects of intranasal 17beta-estradiol administration on autonomic control of heart rate.\nContext 4: Sixty-four postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 65 years without documented coronary artery disease, were randomized in a double-blind, crossover fashion to receive 8 weeks of hormone therapy versus placebo, with or without 80 mg/day of atorvastatin. Before receipt of any therapy and after each treatment period, each woman underwent measures of coronary artery blood flow at rest and stress.\nContext 5: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of statins and hormone therapy on submaximal exercise-induced coronary artery blood flow in postmenopausal women without a history of coronary artery disease. Hormone therapy or statin therapy in early postmenopausal women without coronary artery disease has been shown to enhance arterial endothelial function; we hypothesized that these agents would improve submaximal exercise-induced coronary artery blood flow.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nQuestion: Does oral administration of 17beta-estradiol over 3 months without progestin antagonism improve coronary artery blood flow in postmenopausal women?\nContext 1: Several large epidemiological outcome studies did not demonstrate a benefit of combined estrogen-progestin replacement treatment (HRT) on cardiovascular events in elderly postmenopausal women.

TSP1 can bind to the A2 domain of VWF, which can restrain ADAMTS13 binding to A2 domain. TSP1 can also bind to the A3 domain of VWF, which can restrain ADAMTS13 binding to A3 domain. The results of our assays showed that TSP1 could restrain ADAMTS13 activity up to 70%.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To define whether anti-ribosomal P (anti-P) autoantibodies from patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) impair the function of hippocampal neurons that express the neuronal surface P antigen (NSPA) when accessing the brain via circulating blood.\nContext 2: Serum IgG antibodies (Abs) to phosphorylated ribosomal (P ribosomal) proteins have been inconsistently associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our aim was to assess whether serum IgG Abs to ribosomal P proteins are associated with neuropsychiatric SLE.\nContext 3: Abs to P ribosomal proteins were detected in 45 (21%) patients, 23 of whom (51%) with neuropsychiatric involvement. Abs to P ribosomal protein were present both in serum and CSF. Abs to P ribosomal proteins significantly correlated with psychosis (p=0.017), mononeuropathy multiplex (p=0.040), malar rash (p=0.004), serum anti-Sm Abs (p=0.042), and lupus anticoagulant (p=0.036). SLE onset age was significantly younger in patients with Abs to P ribosomal proteins. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the relationship between Abs to P ribosomal proteins and psychosis, malar rash, SLE onset age and lupus anticoagulant.\nContext 4: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease associated with more than 100 different autoantibodies, some of which may be associated with specific neuropsychiatric (NPSLE) manifestations. Injection of anti-P ribosomal antibodies (anti-P) directly to the brain ventricles of mice induces depression manifested by increased immobility time in the forced swim test (FST).\nContext 5: Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) can be one of the earliest clinical manifestations in human lupus. However, its mechanisms are not fully understood. In lupus, a compromised blood-brain barrier may allow for the passage of circulating autoantibodies into the brain, where they can induce neuropsychiatric abnormalities including depression-like behavior and cognitive abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of B cells and/or autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of murine NPSLE.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe, or not sure.\n\nThe authors found that serum IgG antibodies to phosphorylated ribosomal proteins (P ribosomal proteins) were associated with neuropsychiatric SLE.

However some recent reports questioning the benefit of endovascular therapy have initiated a discussion about the importance of patient-selection. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an elongation of the carotid artery affects the angiographic outcome of the recanalization procedure in middle cerebral artery (MCA)-occlusions.\nContext 2: The data of 54 patients with occlusions of the M1-segment who underwent mechanical thrombectomy were included. The lengths of the carotid arteries were measured using preinterventional computed tomography (CT)-angiograms. To take individual patient's height into account these lengths were divided by the length of the spine from the tip of the dens to the bottom of the th3 vertebral body (referred to as carotid-to-spine (CS)-Ratio). Angiographic results were scored according to the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI)-score.\nContext 3: During the study period, 494 carotid endarterectomies were performed but only 35 patients underwent carotid angiography. The indications for angiography were subocclusion/string sign in 22 patients, to assess the limits of proximal or distal disease in 12 and abnormal anatomy in one. During the 5-year study period the overall perioperative death and/or stroke rate was 4.2%. By 1997, the perioperative stroke rate had fallen to 1.3%. In no case in this series was the operation abandoned due to unexpected findings.\nContext 4: Intraoperative quality control after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been advocated to improve the results of surgical treatment of extracranial carotid artery disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of completion angiography (CA) in prevention of stroke and restenosis after CEA in a single center experience.\nContext 5: Twenty-five patients with a mean age of 62+/-11 years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 14 were identified. Twenty-three of the 25 patients (92%) were successfully revascularized with carotid artery stenting. Patients in group 1 were younger and more likely to have a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Patients in group 2 were more likely to have a history of smoking, hyperlipidemia, and a history of stroke. The mean NIHSS score was 11.5+/-7.5 in group 1 and 14.3+/-8.5 in group 2. The mean age was 62.5+/-11.5 years in group 1 and 66.5+/-11.5 years in group 2. The mean NIHSS score was 11.5+/-7.5 in group 1 and 14.3+/-8.5 in group 2.

Incubation of anterior pituitary cells from ovariectomized rats with 17\u03b2-estradiol enhanced TNFR1 protein expression. As determined by double immunocytochemistry, the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and TNFR1 was detected in prolactin-, GH-, LH- and ACTH-bearing cells. 17\u03b2-estradiol increased the percentage of TNF-\u03b1 and TNFR1-immunoreactive lactotropes but did not modify the number of GH-bearing cells expressing TNF-\u03b1 or TNFR1.\nContext 2: Considering that one of the mechanisms involved in the apoptotic action of estrogens can result from increased expression of cytokines and/or their receptors, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of estrogens on the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and its receptor, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), in anterior pituitary cells.\nContext 3: Upon treatment with anti-TNF, there was an impressive decrease of clinical markers of inflammation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum levels of IL-6. Serum levels of DHEAS and free testosterone were markedly lower at baseline in patients compared to controls, but this did not change during anti-TNF therapy. Serum levels of DHEA and 17ss-estradiol were significantly elevated in patients compared to controls, but similarly, anti-TNF therapy did not change initially increased levels. Molar ratios of hormones, which reflect hormone shifts via converting enzymes, showed typical alterations at baseline, but did not change markedly during anti-TNF therapy.\nContext 4: Estrogens are recognized modulators of pituitary cell renewal, sensitizing cells to mitogenic and apoptotic signals. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in tissue homeostasis modulating cell proliferation, differentiation and death. We previously demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis of anterior pituitary cells from female rats is estrogen-dependent and predominant in cells from rats at proestrus when estradiol levels are the highest.\nContext 5: Androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and testosterone are markedly lower in postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to healthy controls.

Current therapies can normalise the levels of both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1).\nContext 3: GH secretion, in acromegaly, is characterized by increased basal levels, as well as by increased frequency and amplitude of pulses. Evaluation of disease activity during follow-up of treated patients is frequently done with mean GH levels, although there is no established protocol for sample collection.\nContext 4: SSTR2 and 5 expression was tested by IHC (n=37), RT/PCR (n=36) or both (n=13) in GH-secreting adenomas from 60 patients with acromegaly who had undergone pituitary surgery; 36 had been treated preoperatively with octreotide LAR for 3-6 months, and were categorized as responders (achievement of GH <2.5ng/mL and a normal age-adjusted IGF-1), partial responders (GH and IGF-1 reduction >50% and >30%, respectively) or non-responders. IHC was performed on a tissue microarray using specific antibodies directed to the carboxyl terminus of SSTR2 and 5.\nContext 5: 29 patients underwent curative treatment for acromegaly within our timeframe. The mean age for this population was 45.0 years old (range 19-70) and 55.2 % (n = 16) were female. All of these patients were treated with a transsphenoidal resection for a somatotropic pituitary adenoma. 9 (31.1%) of these patients required further medical therapy to be cured. We found statically significant variation in the coronal width of the sella turcica after therapy, which is likely attributable to changes from transsphenoidal resection to medical therapy.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of octreotide LAR on the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in acromegaly patients.\nContext 7: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of octreotide LAR on the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in acromegaly patients.\nContext 8: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of octreotide LAR on the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in acromegaly patients", "No, aprotinin does not affect platelet function in patients undergoing CABG.\n\n## Context 1: Activated uraemic platelets expose the aminophospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) at their outer surface, which generates a cell procoagulant phenotype and seems at least partly due to an increase in cell caspase-3 activity.

Analgesics use was defined as having taken place in the 15 days prior to the interview. Models of multiple logistic regression were used to calculate the associations between the use of analgesics and lifestyle and socio-demographic variables.\nContext 3: The frequency of the analgesics use increased progressively, from 9.8% (confidence interval [CI] 95% 9.3-10.3%) in 1993 to 32.9% (CI 95% 32.4-33.5%) in 2006. Analgesics use was most frequent in women, obese individuals, tobacco users and those who slept 6 or lower hours a night, independent of their self-rated health and chronic diseases. The use of prescription analgesics increased from 55.6% of total consumption in 1993 to 71.6% in 2006, while self-medication fell from 44.4% to 28.4% in the same period.\nContext 4: The objective of the study is to determine if an ED triage pain protocol improves time to provision of analgesics.\nContext 5: We analyzed a group of 144 women undergoing childbirth who received one out of two possible axial analgesia techniques, to find-out factors associated with TTVD. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either a levobupivacaine labor epidural (bolus concentration 0.25 % or less; infusion concentration 0.125 % or less) or a combined spinal-epidural procedure (morphine 0.20 mg, fentanyl 25 \u00b5g and hyperbaric bupivacaine 2.5 mg as spinal components) for labor analgesia. The factors initially chosen were: mother age, height and weight, parity, gestational age, newborn weight, type of labor, analgesic procedure, levobupivacaine and fentanyl doses, Bromage scale, pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and time to provision of analgesics. The results showed that the TTVD technique was associated with a shorter time to provision of analgesics (p<0.001).\nContext 6: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of analgesic use in the emergency department (ED) and to identify the associated factors.

In this study, we examined whether long-term inhibition of Rho kinase suppresses intimal thickening in autologous vein grafts in rabbits.\nContext 2: Male rabbits were randomly divided into two groups and received normal chow (control group) or a special chow containing 0.09% fasudil (fasudil group). After oral administration, fasudil is metabolized to a specific Rho kinase inhibitor, hydroxyfasudil. Each group underwent reversed autologous vein graft surgery with the internal jugular vein into the left common carotid artery. At 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the operation, we examined the extent of intimal thickening of the graft and VSMC proliferation and apoptosis.\nContext 3: RhoA and Rho kinase are important modulators of microvascular tone.\nContext 4: Rat arterial SMCs were cultured in vitro. Linear wound and Boyden microchemotaxis assays of migration were performed in the presence of S-1-P (0.01 to 100 micromol/L) with and without rapamycin (10 nmol/L). Western blotting was performed for phosphorylated and total p70S6K, ERK1/2, and p38(MAPK) after stimulation with S-1-P (0.1 micromol/L), with and without rapamycin pretreatment.

The reference levels of cervical landmarks were C2.13 with mandible angle, C3.54 with hyoid bone, C5.12 with thyroid cartilage, and C6.01 with cricothyroid membrane. The reference levels of cervical landmarks were differently observed by sex, age, and somatometric measurement (height) accordingly mandible angle from C1 to C3, hyoid bone from disc level of C2 and C3 to C5, thyroid cartilage from disc level of C3 and C4 to C7, and cricothyroid membrane from C4 to disc level of C7 and T1", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The objective was to determine whether postprandial responses in hunger and satiety are associated with rs9939609, taking interactions with other relevant candidate genes into account.\nContext 2: A general association test showed a significant association between postprandial responses in hunger and satiety with rs9939609 (P = 0.036 and P = 0.050, respectively). Individuals with low postprandial responses in hunger and satiety were overrepresented among TA/AA carriers in rs9939609 (FTO) compared with TT carriers (dominant and additive model: P = 0.013 and P = 0.020, respectively). Moreover, multifactor dimensionality reduction showed significant epistatic interactions for the postprandial decrease in hunger involving rs9939609 (FTO), rs992472 (DNMT3B), and rs1137101 (LEPR). Individuals with a low postprandial decrease in hunger were overrepresented among TA/AA (dominant), CC/CA (recessive), and AG/GG (dominant) carriers in rs9939609 (FTO), rs992472 (DNMT3B), and rs1137101 (LEPR), respectively (n = 39), compared with TT, AA, and/or AA carriers in these SNPs, respectively (P = 0.00001). Each SNP had an additional effect.\nContext 3: The common rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is associated with adiposity, possibly by affecting satiety responsiveness.\nContext 4: Sixty-two women and 41 men [age: 31 +/- 14 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 25.0 +/- 3.1] were genotyped for 5 SNPs in FTO, DNMT1, DNMT3B, LEP, and LEPR. Individuals received fixed meals provided in energy balance. Hunger and satiety were determined pre- and postprandially by using visual analog scales.\nContext 5: Common FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene variants have recently been strongly associated with body mass index and obesity in several large studies. Here we set out to examine the association of the FTO variant rs9939609 with BMI in a 32 year follow up study of men born 1920-1929. We found that the rs9939609 variant was associated with a 0.5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (P = 0.0001) and a 0.5 kg/m(2) decrease in BMI (P = 0.0001) in men. The association was stronger in women (P = 0.0001) and in men with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or more (P = 0.0001). The association was not modified by age, smoking, or alcohol consumption. The association was not modified by the presence of a family history of obesity. The association was not modified by the presence of a family history of obesity. The association was not", "Yes, rCAN1 plays a role in Salmonella-induced diarrhea.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\nContext 1: Wild type and RCAN1-deficient mice or macrophages were used to characterize the impacts of RCAN1 on intestinal inflammation, inflammatory cytokines production, animal survival, and pathogen clearance following Salmonella challenge.\nContext 2: RCAN1 (regulator of calcineurin 1) has been shown to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the biological implications of RCAN1 during gastrointestinal tract infection remain unclear. In this study, we tried to determine the role of RCAN1 in", "Question: Does perceived Neighborhood Safety Better predict Risk of Mortality for Whites than Blacks??\nExplanation: The data came from the Americans' Changing Lives Study (ACL), 1986-2011, a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of 3361 Black and White adults in the USA. The main predictors of interest were perceived neighborhood safety and perceived neighborhood quality, as measured in 1986 using single items and treated as dichotomous variables. Mortality due to all internal and external causes was the main outcome. Confounders included baseline age, socioeconomic status (education, income), health behaviors (smoking, drinking, and exercise), and health (chronic medical conditions, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms). Race and gender were focal", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) and its receptor are present in the tumor microenvironment. Their function in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains largely unknown. The goal of the present study was to measure the expression of IL-22 and IL-22R in PDAC and assess their relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis.\nContext 2: Chronic pancreatitis is a significant cause of morbidity and a known risk factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Interleukin-1beta is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in pancreatic inflammation. We sought to determine whether targeted overexpression of interleukin-1beta in the pancreas could elicit localized inflammatory responses and chronic pancreatitis.\nContext 3: Positive IL-22 staining was detected in PDAC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. Positive IL-22R staining was detected in PDAC cells. High expression of IL-22 and IL-22R correlated significantly with lymph node involvement. IL-22 increased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription3, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9, and the invasion in PANC1 and BxPC3 cells in vitro while silencing of IL-22R RNA caused opposite effects. Most importantly, overall survival was significantly poorer in patients with high expression of IL-22 and IL-22R than in those with low expression.\nContext 4: The expression of IL-22 and IL-22R was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in PDAC tissues from 57 patients and by Western blotting in six tumors and adjacent nontumor tissues. A statistical analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between levels of expression, clinicopathological factors, and overall survival. In addition, the relationship between the expression of IL-22 and IL-22R and invasion was assessed by Western blotting and transwell assay with the PDAC cell lines PANC1 and BxPC3.\nContext 5: A variety of inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated to participate in tumorigenesis and progression. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) has been demonstrated to show a broad-spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigates the expression of SLPI in human pancreatic cancer tissues and cells as well as its biological effects in human pancreatic cancer cells.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer.\n    - The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) and its receptor are present in the tumor microenvironment.

The abundance of OT and its receptors in atrial myocytes suggests that, directly and/or via the release of the cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, this hormone regulates the force of cardiac contractions. Previous studies have demonstrated a role of OT in myocardial inflammatory responses. We sought to study protective myocardial and anti-inflammatory effects of OT in the immediate post-transplant period.\nContext 2: We grouped adult male Albino rats into sham, control, and OT-treated groups. Control and treated groups underwent heterotopic cervical heart transplantation. Myocardial injury was assessed by measuring plasma cardiac troponin I, and myocardial proinflammatory cytokines as well as by performing histopathologic assessments injury score, and of apoptotic degree. Myocardial myeloperoxidase, neutrophil infiltration, neutrophil chemotactic mediators as well as formation of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species were measured in the myocardium at 3 hours after reperfusion to assess neutrophil-dependent myocardial injury.\nContext 3: We aimed to determine whether PCS accumulation could adversely affect cardiac dysfunction via direct cytotoxicity to cardiomyocytes. In mice that underwent 5/6 nephrectomy, PCS promoted cardiac apoptosis and affected the ratio of left ventricular transmitral early peak flow velocity to left ventricular transmitral late peak flow velocity (the E/A ratio) observed by echocardiography (n=8 in each group). Apocynin, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity, attenuates this alteration of the E/A ratio (n=6 in each group). PCS also exhibited proapoptotic properties in H9c2 cells by upregulating the expression of p22(phox) and p47(phox), NADPH oxidase subunits, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Apocynin and N-acetylcysteine were both able to suppress the effect of PCS, underscoring the importance of NADPH oxidase activation for the mechanism of action.\nContext 4: OT downregulates neutrophil chemotactic molecules--KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2. The decrement in myocardial PMN infiltration was associated with reduced reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species formation in the myocardium. OT also downregulated the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the myocardium. OT treatment also reduced the expression of the proapoptotic molecule Bax and the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in the myocardium. OT treatment also reduced the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the myocardium. OT treatment also reduced the expression of the proapoptotic molecule Bax and the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in the myocardium.\nContext 5: We sought to determine whether OT could protect against myocardial injury in a model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We found that OT", "definitely yes\nExplanation: HIF-1\u03b1 and GLUT-1 are hypoxia-inducible factors that are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. HIF-1\u03b1 is a transcription factor that is induced by hypoxia and is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. GLUT-1 is a glucose transporter that is involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. HIF-1\u03b1 and GLUT-1 are both involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. Therefore, HIF-1\u03b1 and GLUT-1 are both involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. Therefore, HIF-1\u03b1 and GLUT-1 are both involved in the regulation of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Intestines of EBI3-deficient mice had increased pathologic features of colitis, compared with IL-27p28-deficient or control mice; they also had shorter survival times, indicating that IL-35, rather than IL-27, protects the intestine from immune responses in mice. The mucosa of EBI3-deficient mice accumulated subsets of activated CD4+ T cells that produced T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 cytokines. Adoptive transfer of these T cells induced colitis in RAG-deficient mice. The rIL-35 significantly reduced the development of several forms of experimental colitis and reduced levels of markers of Th1 and Th17 cells.\nContext 2: Stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte were treated with miltefosine, and proliferation was measured. We use the CD45RB T-cell transfer colitis model to investigate the effect of miltefosine treatment on intestinal inflammation. Effects on the severity of colitis were studied by histochemical and immunohistochemical staining, and cytokine levels were determined using a cytokine bead array.\nContext 3: Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 mice by giving 3% DSS orally for 7 days. During this period, the mice were treated daily with the excretory/secretory products from T. spiralis adult worms (AES) intraperitoneally. The severity of colitis was monitored by measuring body weight, stool consistency or bleeding, colon length and inflammation. To determine the T. spiralis AES product-induced immunological response, Th1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory cytokine profiles were measured in lymphocytes isolated from colon, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and the spleen of treated mice. The CD4+ CD25+ FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were also measured in the spleens and MLN of treated mice. Mice treated with AES significantly ameliorated the severity of the DSS-induced colitis indicated by the reduced disease manifestations, improved macroscopic and microscopic inflammation correlated with the up-regulation of Treg response (increased regulatory cytokines IL-10, TGF-beta and regulatory T cells) and down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-17) in the spleens, MLN and colon of treated mice.\nContext 4: Regulatory cytokines are well known to modify experimental colitis in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miltefosine on the regulatory cytokine profile in the colonic mucosa of mice with colitis induced by DSS. The colonic mucosa was collected from mice with colitis induced by DSS and treated with miltefosine. The levels of regulatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. The expression of regulatory cytokines was also measured by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that miltefosine treatment significantly increased the levels of regulatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa of mice with colitis induced by DSS. The expression of regulatory cytokines was also increased in the colonic mucosa of mice with colitis induced by DSS treated with miltefosine. These", "Yes, augmented renal clearance is a risk factor for AKI.\nExplanation: Augmented renal clearance refers to increased renal elimination of circulating solutes as compared with normal baseline and could lead to underexposure of frequently used renally eliminated antimicrobials. The primary objective was to assess the prevalence of augmented renal clearance in an adult non-critically ill surgery population. Besides, predictors for augmented renal clearance were investigated. A prospective observational single-center point prevalence study was conducted.\nContext 1: Augmented renal clearance prevalence was 30% and 35% in 103 abdominal and 129 trauma surgery patients, respectively. Younger age (abdominal cohort: relative risk, 0", "Contexts:\nContext 1: We retrospectively assessed haemostasis parameters including platelet function testing by PFA 100 as well as the numbers of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates, fresh frozen plasmas (FFPs), and platelet concentrates (PCs) that were given peri-operatively and during the first two postoperative days in 2,831 cardiac surgery patients. Logistic regression analyses were used to select those parameters, which could predict blood product requirement.\nContext 2: Standard haemostasis screening tests are performed to reveal unknown congenital or acquired disturbances of plasma and/or platelet haemostasis. Since their diagnostic efficacy is often low, routinely performed haemostasis testing has been questioned. We investigated whether preoperatively assessed haemostasis testing can be used to predict the requirement of blood products.\nContext 3: Of our study cohort, 56.5% needed RBCs, 15% FFPs, and 5% PCs. The need for RBCs was associated with significantly altered pre-operative values of most haemostasis parameters. However, by the use of logistic regression analysis fibrinogen was the only haemostasis parameter that was independently associated with the use of RBCs (odds ratio 1.56; 95% CI: 1.27-1.91; P <0.001). The predictive value of other parameters such as age, body weight, haemoglobin, and haematocrit was however much higher in comparison to fibrinogen (odds ratios: 1.92-3.50; P <0.001). It was not possible to develop a score based on haemostasis parameters to accurately identify patients at risk for RBC use. Moreover, we were unable to estimate the need for FFPs and PCs using preoperative haemostasis testing.\nContext 4: This prospective non randomized observational study evaluated the effects of a standardized multidisciplinary transfusion strategy on allogeneic blood products exposure in patients undergoing non-emergent cardiac surgery. The developed strategy involved a standardized blood conservation program and a multidisciplinary allogeneic blood transfusion policy based mainly on clinical judgement, not only on a specific hemoglobin concentration. Data obtained in a first group including patients operated from September 1997 to August 1998 (Group pre: n=321), when the transfusion strategy was progressively developed, were compared to those obtained in a second group, including patients operated from September 1998 to August 1999 (Group post: n=1,000). The results showed that the use of allogeneic blood products was significantly reduced in Group post compared to Group pre (p<0.001). The use of allogeneic blood products was significantly reduced in Group post compared to Group pre (p<0.001). The use of allogeneic blood products was significantly reduced in Group post compared to Group pre (p<0.001). The use of allogeneic blood products was significantly reduced in Group post compared to Group pre (p<0.001). The use of allogeneic blood products was significantly reduced in Group post compared to Group pre", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To clarify the influence of the removal of DMSO by this method on the speed of engraftment in unrelated cord blood transplantation, 46 adult patients with cord blood units processed by the Tokyo Cord Blood Bank from September 1998 to March 31, 2002 were studied. Twenty-four patients received 2.6 +/- 0.71 x 10(7) nucleated cells per kg without washing (nonwashed group), while 22 patients were received 2.7 +/- 0.52 x 10(7) nucleated cells per kg after 2x dilution washing (washed group).\nContext 2: Prolonged periods of marrow hypoplasia have been a problem in cord blood transplantation. DMSO is thought to produce osmotic shock to the progenitors when the thawed cells are infused into the patients. To solve this problem, a 2x dilution method originally developed in the New York Blood Center showed earlier myeloid engraftment,1 although follow-up clinical studies have not performed.\nContext 3: Clinical transplant outcome with umbilical cord blood (UCB) as source of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) is, among other factors, determined by the total number of viable nucleated cells and/or CD34+ cells in the unit. Quantitative and qualitative losses by processing and cryopreservation and by thawing and washing before transfusion may occur, however. Another reason for a discrepancy between the number of cells in the unit released by the cord blood bank and found in the transplant center may be technical differences in cell counting methods between the two sites.\nContext 4: All cord blood recipients engrafted and displayed mixed chimerism early after transplantation; 13/27 converted to full donor chimerism over time, while 14 maintained stable mixed chimerism; all patients are alive and transfusion-independent. Twenty-four of the 79 bone marrow-recipients (12 UD- and 12 RD-BMT) exhibited full donor chimerism at all time points examined, 4/79 (2 UD- and 2 RD-BMT) did not engraft and 51/79 (23 UD- and 28 RD-BMT) displayed mixed chimerism at the time of hematologic reconstitution. Forty of 51 bone marrow recipients with mixed chimerism converted to full donor chimerism (17 UD- and 23 RD-BMT) and 11/51 (5 UD- and 6 RD-BMT) maintained mixed chimerism. The bone marrow recipients with mixed chimerism were younger than those with full donor chimerism (mean +/- SD, 24 +/- 5 vs. 32 +/- 7 years, p < 0.05). The bone marrow recipients with mixed chimerism were more likely to have received a UD-BMT (p < 0.05) and to have received a UD-BMT with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (p < 0.05). The bone marrow recipients with mixed chimerism were more likely to have received a UD-BMT with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (p < 0.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: One disorienting movement pattern, common during flight, is the entering of a coordinated turn. While the otoliths persistently sense upright head position, the change in roll attitude constitutes a semicircular canal stimulus. This sensory conflict also arises during acceleration in a swing-out gondola centrifuge. From a vestibular viewpoint there are, however, certain differences between the two stimulus situations; the aim of the present study was to elucidate whether these differences are reflected in the perceived roll attitude.\nContext 2: Eight nonpilots were tested in a centrifuge (four runs) and during flight (two turns). The subjective visual horizontal (SVH) was measured using an adjustable luminous line in darkness. The centrifuge was accelerated from stationary to 1.56 G (roll 50\u00b0) within 7 s; the duration of the G plateau was 5 min. With the aircraft, turns with approximately 1.4 G (45\u00b0) were entered within 15 s and lasted for 5 min. Tilt perception (TP) was defined as the ratio of SVH/real roll tilt; initial and final values were calculated for each centrifugation/turn.\nContext 3: In both systems there was a sensation of tilt that declined with time. The initial TP was (mean \u00b1 SD): 0.40 \u00b1 0.27 (centrifuge) and 0.37 \u00b1 0.30 (flight). The final TP was 0.20 \u00b1 0.26 and 0.17 \u00b1 0.19, respectively. Both initial and final TP correlated between the two conditions.\nContext 4: Essentially no data exist to assess the utility of posturography, a frequently used test of standing balance in measuring change. The authors examined 1) how changes in posturography relate to functional balance changes as measured in the clinic and gait laboratory and 2) posturography's role and value in assessing patients with vestibular dysfunction.\nContext 5: Horizontal canal function in response to caloric and high-frequency rotation (0.25-5 Hz).

The cells respond to gastrin by the release of histamine (associated with loss of secretory vesicles), which is thought to mediate the gastrin-induced stimulation of the parietal cells. Gastric acid secretion is stimulated also by vagal excitation, which can be induced, for instance, by pylorus ligation. The present study addresses the question whether the ECL cells are involved in the acid response to pylorus ligation.\nContext 2: PYY is released from the distal ileum by fat and may be involved in mediating lipid-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion and intestinal motility. The role of PYY in intestinal lipid-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in awake rats was investigated using a specific polyclonal antibody raised against PYY.\nContext 3: Helicobacter pylori alterations in gastric acid output and mucosal proliferation may involve the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell. To test whether H. pylori affects ECL cell histamine secretion and proliferation, the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on ECL cell function in vitro was investigated.\nContext 4: In previous studies on rats, we have shown that aspirin (ASA)-induced injury to the gastric mucosa is markedly reduced or completely abolished if ASA is chemically associated with the phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC). We have also shown that the protective effect of PC does not influence the ability of ASA to inhibit mucosal cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in the stomach and other tissues. We therefore sought to assess the effect of PC-associated ASA (ASA/PC) on the gastric mucosa of normal volunteers and to compare the results with the use of ASA alone.\nContext 5: We studied 31 H. pylori positive and 28 H. pylori negative volunteers, matched for age, gender and body mass index. Jumbo biopsies were taken at 11 predetermined locations from the gastro-oesophageal junction and stomach. Combined high-resolution pH metry (12 sensors) and manometry (36 sensors) was performed for 20\u2005min fasted and 90\u2005min postprandially. The squamocolumnar junction was marked with radio-opaque markers. The pH and pressure profiles were analysed using a custom-made software.\nContext 6: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a single dose of aspirin (ASA) on gastric mucosal COX-2 expression in healthy volunteers. The study was performed in 20 healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) aged 20\u201340\u2005years. The volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either ASA (100\u2005mg) or placebo (placebo) orally. The volunteers were studied 1\u2005h after the administration of ASA or placebo.

Among them, 8 patients were excluded due to incomplete medical records. Finally, a total of 64 ECCs with submucosa (SM) invasion and size less than 20 mm were included. One hundred fifty-two adenomas with size less than 20 mm were included as controls. Nine endoscopic features, including seven morphological findings (i.e., loss of lobulation, excavation, demarcated and depressed areas, stalk swelling, fullness, fold convergence, and bleeding ulcers), pit patterns, and non-lifting signs, were evaluated retrospectively. All endoscopic features were evaluated by two experienced endoscopists who have each performed over 1000 colonoscopies annually for more than five years without knowledge of the histology.\nContext 2: End-to-end colonoscopies were performed in 50 patients by two different endoscopists blinded for each other's results. Lesions detected during initial standard colonoscopy (C1) were biopsied or removed by snare resection. The second colonoscopy (C2) was done with a zoom colonoscope spraying the whole colon with indigocarmine (0.4%). In addition, detected mucosal lesions were documented prior to ZE and then classified according to the pit pattern classification before biopsy or removal. The retrieval time for each procedure was determined.\nContext 3: A series of consecutive patients treated with laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer (n = 174) in the period 1998-2003 was evaluated retrospectively. Median follow-up was 51 months with a minimum of 3 years.\nContext 4: Endoscopic surveillance is recommended and widely practiced after definitive treatment for colorectal cancer, yet to the authors' knowledge there is little evidence supporting its benefit. The purpose of the current study was to estimate the impact of endoscopic surveillance on colorectal cancer-specific survival for persons with localized or regional colorectal cancer. The population included Medicare patients (age >or=65 years) who were diagnosed with local or regional stage colorectal cancer between 1986 and 1996.\nContext 5: Effective interventions to prevent residual and/or recurrent adenoma (RRA) after EMR are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technique of EMR, the \"double-fire\" technique, in preventing RRA. The study population consisted of 100 patients who underwent EMR for adenomas with a diameter of 1-2 mm. The patients were divided into two groups: the \"double-fire\" group (n = 50) and the \"single-fire\" group (n = 50). The \"double-fire\" group was treated with a double-fire technique, and the \"single-fire\" group was treated with a single-fire technique. The primary endpoint was the number of RRA.

However, the impact of RAS mutations on response to chemotherapy remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between RAS mutations and response to preoperative chemotherapy and their impact on survival in patients undergoing curative resection of CLM.\nContext 2: RAS and PIK3CA mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have been associated with worse survival. We sought to evaluate the impact of RAS and PIK3CA mutations on cumulative incidence of metastasis to potentially curable sites of liver and lung and other sites such as bone and brain.\nContext 3: The identification of RAS status (KRAS and NRAS) has changed the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The impact of the RAS mutation on cytotoxic chemotherapy efficacy has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, several retrospective studies suggest a greater efficacy of oxaliplatin in mCRC with KRAS mutation.\nContext 4: To assess the potential association between the change in diameter of colorectal liver metastases between pre-operative imaging and liver resection and disease-free survival in patients who do not receive pre-operative liver-directed chemotherapy.\nContext 5: Optimal morphologic response and major pathologic response were more common in patients with wild-type RAS (32.9 and 58.9%, respectively) than in patients with RAS mutations (10.5 and 36.8%; P = 0.006 and 0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that wild-type RAS was a strong predictor of optimal morphologic response [odds ratio (OR), 4.38; 95% CI 1.45-13.15] and major pathologic response (OR, 2.61; 95% CI 1.17-5.80). RAS mutations were independently correlated with both overall survival and recurrence free-survival (hazard ratios, 3.57 and 2.30, respectively, in model 1, and 3.19 and 2.09, respectively, in model 2). Subanalysis revealed that RAS mutational status clearly stratified survival in patients with inadequate response to preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\n1.

We investigated the effects of normothermic and hypothermic anesthesia on local CBF (LCBF) and local CGU (LCGU).\nContext 2: Although mild resuscitative hypothermia (34 degrees C) immediately after cardiac arrest improves neurological outcome in dogs, its effects on cerebral blood flow and metabolism are unknown.\nContext 3: The purpose of this study was to determine whether oxygen treatment could attenuate the alterations in cerebral energy metabolism found in the brain following hypoxia-ischemia.\nContext 4: In aged humans, stroke is a major cause of disability for which no neuroprotective measures are available. A viable alternative to conventional drug-based neuroprotective therapies is brain/body cooling, or hypothermia. In animal studies of focal ischemia, short-term hypothermia consistently reduces infarct size. Nevertheless, efficient neuroprotection requires long-term, regulated lowering of whole body temperature. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by reversible occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in 17-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. After stroke, the aged rats were exposed for 2 days to a mixture of air and a mild inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), which resulted in sustained, deep hypothermia (30.8+/-0.7 degrees C). Long-term hypothermia led to a 50% reduction in infarct size with a concomitant reduction in the number of phagocytic cells. At the transcription level, hypothermia caused a reduction in the mRNA coding for caspase 12, NF-kappa B and grp78 in the peri-infarcted region, suggesting an overall decrease in the transcriptional activity related to inflammation and apoptosis. Behaviorally, hypothermia was associated with better performance on tests that require complex sensorimotor skills, in the absence of obvious neurological deficits or physiological side effects, in aged rats.\nContext 5: To determine how mild hypothermia (34 degrees C) affects the hemodynamic and the stress hormonal responses intraoperatively and during extubation in patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm surgery.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the article.\n1.

Nevertheless, efficient neuroprotection requires long-term, regulated lowering of whole body temperature. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Heart transplantation is associated with cold, cardioplegic arrest that impairs myocardial function. Protein Kinase C (PKC) suppression of myofilaments may contribute to this dysfunction. CapZ-deficient cardiac myofilaments are unresponsive to PKC. We hypothesized that myofilaments from CapZ-deficient transgenic hearts are resistant to cardioplegic dysfunction and that PKC inhibition improves function.\nContext 2: Wildtype hearts showed impaired function after cardioplegic arrest. CapZ-deficient transgenic mouse hearts performed significantly better after 1 h cardioplegia than wildtype hearts, but not after 4 h cardioplegic arrest. Wildtype myofilaments had depressed activation at 1 and 4 h cardioplegic arrest, as demonstrated by reduced actomyosin MgATPase activity. CapZ-deficient myofilaments showed no reduced actomyosin MgATPase activity at either time. Troponin I (TnI) phosphorylation increased by approximately 20% at 1 and 4 h in wildtype mice. Myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C),and troponin T (TnT) phosphorylation increased by less than 10% at 1 h, and tended to rise at 4 h. Myofilament protein phosphorylation was largely unchanged in CapZ-deficient hearts at 1 h, but MyBP-C tended to be dephosphorylated at 4 h cardioplegic arrest. Myofilament-associated PKC-\u03b1, -\u03b2II, -\u03b4, and -e increased at 1 and 4 h cardioplegia in wildtype hearts, whereas only PKC-\u03b1 increased in transgenic myofilaments at 1 h. PKC inhibition abolished the cardioplegic-dependent changes in actomyosin MgATPase activity and TnI phosphorylation of wildtype myofilaments.\nContext 3: Heart function was assessed using a Langendorff apparatus. Myofilaments isolated from murine hearts were assessed with an actomyosin MgATPase assay and protein phosphorylation gels. PKC activation was examined by immunoblotting.\nContext 4: Permeabilized murine cardiomyocytes from the remaining anterior and a remote non-infarcted inferior LV area were compared with those of non-infarcted age-matched controls. Myofilament phosphorylation, sulfhydryl (SH) status, and Ca2+ sensitivity were assessed.\nContext 5: Myocardial infarction was induced in mice by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Myocardial function was assessed using a Langendorff apparatus. Myofilaments isolated from the infarcted and non-infarcted LV areas were assessed with an actomyosin MgATPase assay and protein phosphorylation gels. PKC activation was examined by immunoblotting.\nContext 6: Myocardial infarction was induced in mice by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Myocardial function was assessed using a Langendorff apparatus.

Rectal instillation of sodium butyrate (NaB) increases visceral sensitivity in rats by an unknown mechanism. We seek to examine the signal transduction pathways responsible for the enhanced neuronal excitability in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following NaB enemas and demonstrate that this is responsible for the colonic hypersensitivity reported in this animal model.\nContext 2: Diabetic patients often experience visceral hypersensitivity and anorectal dysfunction. We hypothesize that the enhanced excitability of colon projecting dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons observed in diabetes is caused by a decrease in the amplitude of the transient A-type K(+) (I(A)) currents resulting from increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and reduced opening of K(v)4.2 channels.\nContext 3: We found that neonatal CI treatment induced long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity without identifiable structural abnormalities in descending colons of adult rats. Neonatal CI treatment evoked a significant up-regulation of the expressions of TLR4 in glia, MyD88, p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB in adult rats. Neonatal CI treatment also increased the levels of its downstream inflammatory agents TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the L2-S4 regions of the spinal cord of adult rats.\nContext 4: Rats with colitis developed macroscopic and microscopic colonic lesions accompanied by a significant decrease in the CBF, a significant rise in colonic weight, MPO activity and plasma IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. These effects were aggravated by ASA and 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole (SC-560), but not celecoxib and counteracted by concurrent treatment with a synthetic prostaglandin E\u2082 (PGE\u2082) analog. Treatment with NO-ASA dose-dependently accelerated colonic healing followed by a rise in plasma NO(x) content and CBF, suppression of MPO and downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNAs. Treatment with GTN, the NO donor, significantly inhibited the ASA-induced colonic lesions and increased CBF, while carboxy-PTIO or capsaicin-denervation counteracted the effects of NO-ASA.\nContext 5: We found that the colonic lesions induced by ASA were significantly attenuated by the administration of the NO donor, GTN, and the COX-2 inhibitor, SC-560, but not by the NO donor, NO-ASA, the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, or the PGE\u2082 analog, PGE\u2082. The effects of GTN and SC-560 were significantly attenuated by the administration of the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and the PGE\u2082 analog, PGE\u2082. The effects of GTN and SC-560 were significantly attenuated by the administration of the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and", "Question: Does therapeutic low energy laser improve the mechanical strength of repairing medial collateral ligament??\nExplanation: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of low energy laser on the mechanical strength of repairing medial collateral ligament (MCL) in rats. The study was conducted in 30 male Wistar rats. The animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham group, laser group, and control group. The sham group was subjected to sham surgery, while the laser group was subjected to laser surgery. The control group was subjected to no surgery. The MCL was repaired in the laser group and the control group. The MCL was repaired in the sham group.

Data on synovial fluid (SF) concentration of Th17 cell-derived cytokine interleukin 17 (IL-17) in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are sparse. We measured levels of IL-17 in SF specimens from children with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and polyarticular JIA (poly-JIA), and studied the ability of IL-17 to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and cytokines by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with ERA.\nContext 2: To investigate the relationship between interleukin 17 (IL-17) producing T cells (Th17) and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in blood and synovial fluid (SF) of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).\nContext 3: IL-17 levels were measured in SF of patients with ERA (n = 43), poly-JIA (n = 17), rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n = 35), and osteoarthritis (OA; n = 10) by ELISA. In patients with JIA, 10 paired serum samples were also assayed. FLS were cultured from SF of patients with ERA and subsequently stimulated for 48 h by IL-17 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Later the production of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, MMP-3, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 was measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA.\nContext 4: Median IL-17 levels in SF were higher in patients with JIA [28 pg/ml (range 0-200)] compared to OA [0 pg/ml (range 0-84); p < 0.001] and RA (p < 0.05). The levels were comparable between poly-JIA patients and the ERA group. The median SF IL-17 levels were significantly higher compared to serum levels in children with JIA (p < 0.005). In ERA, SF IL-17 correlated with number of swollen joints (r = 0.35; p < 0.05), number of joints with limited mobility (r = 0.55; p < 0.001), and number of tender joints (r = 0.46; p < 0.05). In poly-JIA, SF IL-17 correlated with number of swollen joints (r = 0.46; p < 0.05), number of joints with limited mobility (r = 0.46; p < 0.05), and number of tender joints (r = 0.46; p < 0.05). In RA, SF IL-17 correlated with number of swollen joints (r = 0.46; p < 0.05), number of joints with limited mobility (r = 0.46; p < 0.05), and number of tender joints (r = 0.46; p < 0.05).

Large adenomas are especially difficult to resect. Submucosal injection is a key part of EMR, as it allows for complete resection and decreased complications. We previously demonstrated in both animal models and a clinical trial that a focussed fluid beam applied to the mucosa creates selective fluid cushions in the submucosa selective tissue elevation by pressure (STEP). In this study, we examined the potential of this new technique compared to the standard inject and cut technique.\nContext 2: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is today the treatment of choice for flat and sessile colorectal lesion, the only concern being completeness of resection. One of the major issues is the choice of the infiltrating substance to enable a long-lasting cushion under the lesion. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate safety and efficacy of hydroxy-propyl-methyl-cellulose (HPMC) injection for this purpose.\nContext 3: End-to-end colonoscopies were performed in 50 patients by two different endoscopists blinded for each other's results. Lesions detected during initial standard colonoscopy (C1) were biopsied or removed by snare resection. The second colonoscopy (C2) was done with a zoom colonoscope spraying the whole colon with indigocarmine (0.4%). In addition, detected mucosal lesions were documented prior to ZE and then classified according to the pit pattern classification before biopsy or removal. The retrieval time for each procedure was determined.\nContext 4: From January 2005 to September 2011, colonoscopy cohort showed that a total of 72 patients with small colorectal cancers with the size less than 20 mm underwent colonoscopy at the Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. Among them, 8 patients were excluded due to incomplete medical records. Finally, a total of 64 ECCs with submucosa (SM) invasion and size less than 20 mm were included. One hundred fifty-two adenomas with size less than 20 mm were included as controls. Nine endoscopic features, including seven morphological findings (i.e., loss of lobulation, excavation, demarcated and depressed areas, stalk swelling, fullness, fold convergence, and bleeding ulcers), pit patterns, and the presence of a mucosal ulcer, were evaluated. The presence of a mucosal ulcer was defined as a lesion with a mucosal ulcer. The presence of a mucosal ulcer was defined as a lesion with a mucosal ulcer.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that Th17 cells are a prominent source of iFN-\u03b3 in sarcoidosis.", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Nine antigens were commonly recognized by sera from Australian and Chinese subjects. These antigens were of molecular mass 19.5 kDa, 26.5 kDa, 35 kDa, 45 kDa, 60 kDa, 89 kDa (VacA), 116 kDa (CagA), and 180 kDA. A significant association between the prevalence of antibody to the CagA antigen and duodenal ulcer disease was observed in Australian subjects; however, no association between the prevalence of antibody to the CagA antigen and gastric cancer was found in Chinese subjects. In subjects from both countries, a significant association was found between antibody to the 30-kDa and 45-kDa antigens and more serious gastroduodenal disease.\nContext 2: The present study was aimed at assessing the predictive utility of anti-Cag A antibodies in differentiating patients of duodenal ulcer (DU) and non ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) from asymptomatic controls in a developing country.\nContext 3: In adults, a high prevalence of antibody to the cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA) of Helicobacter pylori has been linked to the development of more serious gastroduodenal disease. Few investigators have examined this association in children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of antibody to the CagA antigen as well as other specific H. pylori antigens in children.\nContext 4: Antibody responses to the 26.5-kDa, 30-kDa, and 116-kDa (CagA) antigens were found to be the most prevalent, with 81.5%, 79.6%, and 76% of children, respectively, mounting a response. In contrast, antibody responses to the 19.5-kDa, 35-kDa, 45-kDa, 60-kDa, 89 kDa (VacA), and 180-kDa antigens occurred in 55.5%, 24%, 16.7%, 63%, 37%, and 7.4% of children, respectively. A higher prevalence of antibody response to CagA was found in the symptomatic Australian children with peptic ulcer disease (100%) compared with prevalence in those with nonulcer dyspepsia (56.3%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. No significant difference was found between the prevalence of antibody response to CagA in the symptomatic Chinese children with peptic ulcer disease (100%) compared with prevalence in those with nonulcer dyspepsia (56.3%). The prevalence of antibody response to CagA in the asymptomatic Chinese children with peptic ulcer disease (100%) was significantly higher than that in the asymptomatic Chinese children with nonulcer dyspepsia (56.3%).

Here, we evaluated the utility of UNC2025, a MerTK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for treatment of acute leukemia.\nContext 2: UNC2025 potently inhibited pro-survival signaling, induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation and colony formation in MerTK-expressing ALL and AML cell lines and patient samples. Approximately 30% of primary leukemia patient samples (78 of 261 total) were sensitive to UNC2025. Sensitive samples were most prevalent in the AML, T-ALL, and minimally differentiated (M0) AML subsets. UNC2025 inhibited MerTK in bone marrow leukemia cells and had significant therapeutic effects in xenograft models, with dose-dependent decreases in tumor burden and consistent two-fold increases in median survival, irrespective of starting disease burden. In a patient-derived AML xenograft model, treatment with UNC2025 induced disease regression. Additionally, UNC2025 increased sensitivity to methotrexate in vivo, suggesting that addition of MerTK-targeted therapy to current cytotoxic regimens may be particularly effective and/or allow for chemotherapy dose reduction.\nContext 3: Pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo assays using cell lines and primary leukemia patient samples were utilized to evaluate anti-leukemic effect of UNC2025.\nContext 4: We demonstrate that, although 4-MDDT enters AML cells and inhibits their AKR1C3 activity, it does not recapitulate the anti-leukaemic actions of the pan-AKR1C inhibitor medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Screens of the NCI diversity set and an independently curated small-molecule library identified several additional AKR1C3-selective inhibitors, none of which had the expected anti-leukaemic activity. However, a pan AKR1C, also identified in the NCI diversity set faithfully recapitulated the actions of MPA.\nContext 5: Although the majority of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured with combination chemotherapy containing methotrexate (MTX), drug resistance contributes to treatment failure for a substantial fraction of patients. The primary transporter for folates and MTX is the reduced folate carrier (RFC). Impaired drug transport is associated with poor prognosis in ALL and is a potential therapeutic target. Here, we evaluated the utility of the pan-AKR1C inhibitor UNC2025 for treatment of ALL.\nContext 6: UNC2025 potently inhibited pro-survival signaling, induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation and colony formation in MerTK-expressing ALL and AML cell lines and patient samples.

This subspecies is threatened by habitat fragmentation due to logging and agricultural development, hunting for the bushmeat trade, and possibly climate change. Although P. t. ellioti appears to be geographically separated from the neighboring central chimpanzee (P. t. troglodytes) by the Sanaga River, recent population genetics studies of chimpanzees from across this region suggest that additional factors may also be important in their separation. The main aims of this study were: 1) to model the distribution of suitable habitat for P. t. ellioti across Cameroon and Nigeria, and P. t. troglodytes in southern Cameroon, 2) to determine which environmental factors best predict their optimal habitats, and 3) to compare modeled niches and test for their levels of divergence from one another. A final aim of this study was to examine the ways that climate change might impact suitable chimpanzee habitat across the region under various scenarios.\nContext 2: Ecological niche models (ENMs) were created using the software package Maxent for the three populations of chimpanzees that have been inferred to exist in Cameroon and eastern Nigeria: (i) P. t. troglodytes in southern Cameroon, (ii) P. t. ellioti in northwestern Cameroon, and (iii) P. t. ellioti in central Cameroon. ENMs for each population were compared using the niche comparison test in ENMtools, which revealed complete niche divergence with very little geographic overlap of suitable habitat between populations.\nContext 3: None of the examined Chadic populations displays a departure from the normal mismatch distribution pattern, and the null hypothesis of the expansion event cannot be rejected. Analyses of molecular variance and F(ST) genetic distances revealed that the Chadic-speaking groups of northern Cameroon share more similarities with the populations of the Upper and Middle Nile Valley and East Africa than with populations from Central Africa. The results show geographical clustering to be more important than the correlation of linguistic affiliations with molecular genetic data.\nContext 4: The timing of migration substantially influences individual fitness. To match peak requirements with peak resource availability, we hypothesized that individual migrants schedule spring migration in close relation to seasonal changes in environmental conditions along the route and particularly, at the breeding destination.To test this hypothesis, we investigated the timing of spring migration in a population of the endangered red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Swiss Alps. We used a combination of radio-telemetry and genetic analyses to determine the timing of spring migration and the genetic structure of the population. We found that the timing of spring migration is strongly influenced by the timing of the snow melt. The timing of spring migration is also influenced by the genetic structure of the population. The genetic structure of the population is determined by the genetic structure of the population. The genetic structure of the population is determined by the genetic structure of the population.

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high expression of Rad51 indicated a poorer disease free survival (DFS) of ESCC patients compared with the patients with low expression of Rad51 (P\u2009=\u20090.031), similar result also shown in overall survival (OS) analysis (P\u2009=\u20090.034). Furthermore, Rad51 expression could stratify node positive patients in DFS (P\u2009=\u20090.021) and OS (P\u2009=\u20090.035). Multivariate analysis confirmed the Rad51 expression was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (HR\u2009=\u20091.603, P\u2009=\u20090.013) and OS (HR\u2009=\u20091.555, P\u2009=\u20090.021) of ESCC patients.\nContext 3: We evaluated Rad51 expression in 230 surgically resected ESCC specimens by immunochemistry using tissue microarray and correlated with clinicopathological features including post-operation survival.\nContext 4: By using cDNA microarray analysis, we identified a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR39, that is significantly up-regulated in ESCC. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of GPR39 in human esophageal cancer development, and to examine the prevalence and clinical significance of GPR39 overexpression in ESCC.\nContext 5: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a malignant tumor with a strong tendency toward familial aggregation and a higher incidence as well as mortality in Kazakh population.

Cardiovascular events are associated with significant morbidity. However, current trends in cardiovascular events after kidney transplantation are poorly understood.\nContext 3: Cardiovascular disease and renal impairment are common in cirrhotic transplant candidates. We aimed to investigate potential association between pretransplant renal function impairment and cardiac events after liver transplantation.\nContext 4: In a cohort", "Contexts:\nContext 1: The incidence and injury patterns of open fractures of the proximal ulna are poorly elucidated and little evidence exists to guide management.\nContext 2: The purpose of this study was to compare the (1) bony injury patterns; (2) range of motion (ROM) and frequency of union; and (3) postoperative complications between open and closed fractures of the proximal ulna.\nContext 3: Overall, open fractures of the proximal ulna overall did not have more complex bony injury patterns, but there were more anterior olecranon fracture-dislocations among the open fracture group (nine of 60 [15%] versus two of 91 [2%]; p = 0.004) and more posterior olecranon fracture-dislocations in the closed fracture group (31 of 91 [34%] versus seven of 60 [12%]; p = 0.002). Final ROM was not different in both groups and all fractures healed. There was no difference in wound infection rate but a higher secondary procedure rate among open fractures of the proximal ulna (39% versus 23%, p = 0.014).\nContext 4: Seventy-nine consecutive open fractures of the proximal ulna were identified. After excluding fracture-dislocations, penetrating injuries, and pediatric injuries, 60 were compared in a retrospective case-control study with an age- and sex-matched group of 91 closed fractures to compare the bony injury patterns based on radiographic review. In a subset of 39 open and 39 closed fractures with sufficient followup, chart and radiographic review was performed by someone other than the operating surgeon to compare differences in final ROM, union, and postoperative complication rates at a minimum followup of 3 months (mean, 22 and 15 months; range, 3-86 months and 3-51 months for open and closed fractures, respectively). A total of 12% of the fractures were open (79 of 671) at the three study centers, and the majority of fractures were intraarticular (45 of 60 [75%]) with Gustilo-Anderson Type I and II wounds (54 of 60 [90%]).\nContext 5: We reviewed previously published articles and included in current systematic review those studies with accurate multivariate analyses that included age, fracture type, operation method, follow-up, ONFH occurrence and injury-to-surgery interval.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true about the incidence and injury patterns of open fractures of the proximal ulna?\n\nA.

Patients were selected from October 2007 to January 2009", "Contexts:\nContext 1: Surgical treatment of inguinal hernias in adolescents is controversial as these patients do not fit into the traditional pediatric and adult populations. We aimed to compare the preferences of adult general surgeons and pediatric surgeons in managing adolescents by conducting a survey through social media.\nContext 2: A poll was posted on the International Hernia Collaboration Group Facebook page as well as the Facebook page for the authoring pediatric surgeon. The poll gave scenarios of a 16-year-old male with an inguinal hernia and asked surgeons to select one of five listed procedures to repair the hernia: high ligation (open or laparoscopic), mesh repair (open or laparoscopic) or open muscle repair. The four scenarios differed in the diameter of the internal ring (1 vs. 4\u00a0cm) and the BMI of the patient (20 vs. 35). Fisher's exact test was implemented for statistical analysis.\nContext 3: In total, 43 (67\u00a0%) adult surgeons and 21 (33\u00a0%) pediatric surgeons responded. In the routine adolescent (normal BMI, small defect), 65\u00a0% of adult surgeons chose adult-type repairs (mesh or muscle repairs) whereas 86\u00a0% of pediatric surgeons chose pediatric-type repairs (high ligation). When the size of the defect increased, 100\u00a0% of adult surgeons and 81\u00a0% of pediatric surgeons selected an adult-type repair, suggesting agreement. When the patient was obese, there was a tendency to prefer laparoscopy. In all patient scenarios, the answers were significantly different between pediatric and adult surgeons (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nContext 4: Repair of an indirect inguinal hernia is the most common procedure performed by pediatric surgeons, yet the need for contralateral exploration remains controversial. This prospective study evaluated the use of laparoscopy combined with the selective use of probing to determine the presence or absence of a contralateral patent processus vaginalis (CPPV).\nContext 5: This study used data from the Danish Hernia Database to create the following cohort: All patients operated laparoscopically for primary groin hernia with a TAPP procedure using fibrin sealant for mesh fixation. These patients were matched 1:2 with patients, where the mesh was fixated using tacks. A validated questionnaire was sent to all included patients to determine recurrence, which was defined as reoperation or clinical diagnosis of recurrence by a physician. Follow-up was from index operation to either reoperation date or last follow-up date.\nContext 6: The study was conducted in a tertiary referral center.

The aim of our study was to perform an association analysis of promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -159C/T (rs2569190) in the CD14 gene for Slovenian children with asthma.\nContext 2: CD14 functions as a multifunctional receptor for bacterial cell wall components including endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide and is likely to play a role in the polarisation of T lymphocytes into Th1 and Th2 subsets, thereby influencing the cytokine profile and subsequent IgE production in response to antigen/allergen contact in allergic phenotypes. A functional C-159T polymorphism has been described in the promoter region of the gene and has been associated with increased gene expression, atopy, and non-atopic asthma in different ethnic populations. A study was undertaken to examine the association between the C-159T polymorphism and asthma, asthma severity, and atopy in a large Australian white population.\nContext 3: PCR-RFLP analysis was used to characterise the C-159T polymorphism in mild (n = 264), moderate (n = 225) and severe (n = 79) asthmatic patients and non-asthmatic controls (n = 443), including atopic (n = 688) and non-atopic (n = 323) individuals. Association analyses were performed using chi(2) tests.\nContext 4: We found that SNP -159C/T in CD14 is not associated with asthma in Slovenian children. However, non-atopic asthmatics with CT or TT genotypes have a lower FEV1/FVC ratio as a measure of bronchial obstruction (87.4%, compared to 91.8% in patients with the CC genotype, p = 0.017). Non-atopic asthmatics with CC or CT genotypes also have increased bronchial hyperreactivity measured by PC20 of methacholine (0.41 mg/ml, compared to 1.50 mg/ml in patients with a TT genotype, p = 0.018).\nContext 5: Questionnaire data, serum IgE levels, and genotypes for 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms in CD14 were assessed in farmers' and nonfarmers' children from the same village in Slovenia. The results showed that the C-159T polymorphism in CD14 is not associated with asthma in Slovenian children. However, non-atopic asthmatics with CT or TT genotypes have a lower FEV1/FVC ratio as a measure of bronchial obstruction (87.4%, compared to 91.8% in patients with the CC genotype, p = 0.017). Non-atopic asthmatics with CC or CT genotypes also have increased bronchial hyperreactivity measured by PC20 of methacholine (0.41 mg/ml, compared to 1.50 mg/ml in patients with a TT genotype, p = 0.018).\nContext 6: The", "Contexts:\nContext 1: RBP-J is the major downstream effector of all four mammalian Notch receptors and the RBP-J conditional mouse facilitates inactivation of canonical Notch signals. Patched1 is a negative regulator of Hedgehog signalling and the Patched1 conditional mouse is widely used to activate Hedgehog signalling via Patched1 deletion in specific cell types. The conditional mouse lines were crossed with a Math1-Cre line to delete the two genes in granule neuron progenitors from embryonic day 10.5. While deletion of only Patched1 as well as Patched1 together with RBP-J leads to formation of medulloblastoma concomitant with disorganisation of cell layers, loss of RBP-J from granule neuron progenitors has no obvious effect on overall cerebellar morphology or differentiation and maturation of the different cerebellar cell types.\nContext 2: The Notch signalling pathway plays crucial roles in neural development, functioning by preventing premature differentiation and promotion of glial cell fates. In the developing cerebellum Notch pathway components are expressed in granule neuron progenitors of the external germinal layer (EGL) but the precise function of Notch in these cells is unclear. The Hedgehog pathway is also crucial in cerebellar development, mainly via control of the cell cycle, and persistent activation of the pathways leads to the cerebellar tumour medulloblastoma. Interactions between Hedgehog and Notch have been reported in normal brain development as well as in Hedgehog pathway induced medulloblastoma but the molecular details of this interaction are not known and we investigate here the role of Notch signalling in the development of the EGL and the intersection between the two pathways in cerebellar granule neuron progenitors and in medulloblastoma.\nContext 3: Dysregulation and activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling may contribute to tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and metastatic seeding in several solid tumours.\nContext 4: \u2002 Significant numbers of cells with basal dendrites were found in this model, but their structure was distinct from basal dendrites seen in other epilepsy models, often ending in complex tufts of short branches and spines. Even more unusual, a subset of cells with basal dendrites had an inverted appearance; they completely lacked apical dendrites. Spines on basal dendrites were found to be apposed to ZnT-3 immunoreactive puncta, suggestive of recurrent mossy fiber sprouting. The basal dendrites of these cells were also found to be innervated by a subset of axons that were immunoreactive for the vesicular glutamate transporter VGluT1. These axons were also found to be innervating the basal dendrites of other cells. The basal dendrites of these cells were also found to be innervated by a subset of axons that were immunoreactive for the vesicular glutamate transporter VGluT1. These axons were also found to be innervating the basal dendrites of other cells.

However, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are not seen in cats. In people, they are associated with the development of an inflammatory response, which, we hypothesized, does not occur in cats.\nContext 2: Cathepsin S has been suggested provide a mechanistic link between obesity and atherosclerosis, possibly mediated via adipose tissue-derived inflammation. Previous data have shown an association between circulating cathepsin S and inflammatory markers in the obese, but to date, community-based reports are lacking. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the association between serum levels of cathepsin S and markers of cytokine-mediated inflammation in a community-based sample, with prespecified subgroup analyses in nonobese participants.\nContext 3: Fat was equally distributed between subcutaneous and visceral depots. Insulin-independent glucose uptake increased and insulin sensitivity decreased with increasing adiposity. However, baseline glucose concentrations were unchanged suggesting a decrease in EGP. Inflammatory cytokines (Il-1, IL-6, TNFa) and catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase did not change. Insulin, proinsulin, and leptin were positively and adiponectin negatively correlated with adiposity. Heat production increased with obesity, but became less when body weight gain was > 60%.\nContext 4: DIO mice decreased body weight and fat mass in response to chow, but supplementation with leucine did not affect these parameters. During weight maintenance, mice supplemented with leucine had improved glucose tolerance, increased leptin sensitivity, and lower respiratory quotient. The latter was associated with changes in the expression of several genes modulating fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial activity in the epididymal white and the brown adipose tissues, but not muscle.\nContext 5: DIO animals had significantly (p < 0.05) increased body weight (721.2 \u00b1 6.3 g) compared to age- and sex-matched controls (643.4 \u00b1 14.6 g), as well as a significant increase (p < 0.01) in body fat percentage (29.7 \u00b1 1.7% and 22.7 \u00b1 0.97%, respectively). No significant difference in fasting plasma insulin levels could be detected between the two groups (chow-fed group 141.5 \u00b1 15.1 pmol/l and DIO group 143.5 \u00b1 15.1 pmol/l). The DIO group had significantly (p < 0.05) higher fasting plasma glucose levels (7.1 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/l) compared to the chow-fed group (6.9 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/l). The DIO group had significantly (p < 0.05) higher fasting plasma insulin levels (3.2 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/l) compared to the chow-fed group (2.9 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/l). The DIO group had significantly (p < 0.05) higher fasting plasma glucose levels (7.1 \u00b1 0.2 mm", "Question: Are medical emergency teams associated with reduced mortality across a major metropolitan health network after two years service : a retrospective study using government administrative data??\nYes, medical emergency teams are associated with reduced mortality across a major metropolitan health network after two years service : a retrospective study using government administrative data.\nThe study was conducted in a large metropolitan health network in Australia.

This study was designed to elucidate the knowledge about hypertension in hypertensive patients at three tertiary care centers in Karachi. Secondly we sought to compare the knowledge of those with uncontrolled hypertension and controlled hypertension.\nContext 2: It was a cross-sectional study conducted at The Aga Khan University hospital (AKUH), Ziauddin Hospital (ZH) and Civil hospital, Karachi (CHK. All diagnosed Hypertensive patients (both inpatients and outpatients) coming to a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan aged > 18 years were included. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: controlled and uncontrolled hypertension based on their initial BP readings on presentation Uncontrolled Hypertension was defined as average BP \u2265 140/90 mm Hg in patients on treatment. Controlled Hypertension (HTN) was defined as average BP <140/90 mm Hg in patients on treatment. Standardized methods were used to record BP in the sitting position. Knowledge was recorded as a15 item question. Primary outcome was knowledge about hypertension.\nContext 3: A total of 650 participants were approached and consented 447 were found eligible. 284(63.5%) were from Aga Khan University, 101(22.6) from Dow University of health sciences and 62(13.9) were from Ziauddin University. Mean (SD) age of participants was 57.7(12) years, 50.1(224) were men. Controlled hypertension was present in 323(72.3) and uncontrolled hypertension was present in 124(27.4). The total mean (SD) Knowledge score was 20.97(4.93) out of a maximum score of 38. On comparison of questions related to knowledge between uncontrolled and controlled hypertension, there was statistically significant different in; meaning of hypertension (p <0.001), target SBP(p0.001), target DBP(p 0.001), importance of SBP versus DBP, improvement of health with lowering of blood pressure (p 0.002), high blood pressure being asymptomatic (p <0.001), changing lifestyle improves blood pressure(p 0.003),hypertension being a lifelong disease (<0.001), lifelong treatment with antihypertensives(<0.001) and high blood pressure being part of aging(<0.001).

However, the molecular mechanisms that control RPE proliferation and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during regeneration remain poorly understood. We investigated the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the regeneration of mouse RPE after laser photocoagulation.\nContext 2: C57BL/6J mice were photocoagulated unilaterally. To determine the \u03b2-catenin-dependent Wnt signal transduction in the photocoagulated RPE, the expression levels of Wnts, \u03b2-catenin, and their target genes were analyzed using real time-PCR and Western blotting. Retinal pigment epithelium proliferation and EMT were determined by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay and by profiling expression of EMT markers, respectively, in eyes injected intravitreally with a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling antagonist, Dkk-1, after laser photocoagulation.\nContext 3: GDNF gene transfer resulted in sustained protein expression in the eye. In addition, the results confirmed in vivo that PR-restricted activation of Ret signaling occurred after either AAV-mediated expression of RetMen2A or AP20187-dependent Fv2Ret activation. However, this or AAV-mediated GDNF retinal gene transfer did not result in functional or morphologic PR protection from light-induced damage.\nContext 4: Expression of several of the 19 Wnt genes was significantly increased in laser-treated RPE. The expression levels of \u03b2-catenin signaling target genes cyclin D1, Otx2, and Mitf were higher in laser-treated RPE than in control RPE. The number of EdU-positive cells in the laser-treated area was significantly lower in the Dkk-1-injected group than in the laser-treated group or laser-treated + vehicle-injected group. There were more Otx2- and Mitf-positive cells after laser photocoagulation and markedly fewer in the Dkk-1-injected group. Otx2- and Mitf-positive cells were colocalized with EdU-positive cells. The EMT markers vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were upregulated in the laser-treated area and significantly downregulated in the Dkk-1-injected group.\nContext 5: The results of this study suggest that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is involved in the proliferation and EMT of RPE after laser photocoagulation. The expression levels of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling target genes were higher in laser-treated RPE than in control RPE. The number of EdU-positive cells in the laser-treated area was significantly lower in the Dkk-1-injected group than in the laser-treated group or laser-treated + vehicle-injected group. There were more Otx2- and Mitf-positive cells after laser photocoagulation and markedly fewer in the Dkk-1-injected group.

The objective was to measure the difference between publicly posted and actual ED wait times and to compare these between ED site volumes.\nContext 2: This study was a retrospective consecutive sample of ED patients at one hospital system with four EDs. The wait times of 8,889 patients were included in this analysis. One ED was in a large teaching hospital with 5,000 ED patients per month; the other three were freestanding or community EDs without teaching and with fewer than 2,000 ED patients per month each. The publicly posted ED wait times at the time of patient arrival were recorded and compared to the actual wait times as retrieved from the ED tracking system. The difference between posted and actual wait times for each site was calculated. Separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests with post hoc testing were conducted to assess actual wait time and wait time difference between ED sites.\nContext 3: Proposed national performance measures for severe sepsis or septic shock include interventions within 3 hours of emergency department (ED) arrival rather than from time of first meeting diagnostic criteria. We aim to determine the percentage of ED patients who first meet criteria greater than 3 hours after arrival.\nContext 4: This is a retrospective review of patients evaluated by emergency medicine (EM) residents working 9-hour (eight hours of patient care, one hour wrap-up time) and 12-hour shifts (12 hours patient care, no reserved time for wrap-up). Data were collected by reviewing the clinical tracker. A patient was assigned to the resident who initiated care and dictated the chart. SO was defined as any patient in the ED without disposition at change of shift. Patient turn-around-time (TAT) was also recorded.\nContext 5: It has been proved that emergency medical dispatch centers (EMDC) save lives by promoting an appropriate allocation of emergency medical service resources. Indeed, optimal dispatcher call duration is pivotal to reduce the time gap between the time a call is placed and the delivery of medical care. However, little is known about the impact of work shift configurations (i.e., work shift duration and work shift rotation throughout the day) and dispatcher call duration. Thus, the objective of our study was to assess the effect of work shift configurations on dispatcher call duration.\n\nBased on the contexts above, answer the question below in yes, no, maybe.\nProvide a short explanation that justifies your answer using evidence from the context.\n    - Context 1: Hospitals around the United States are advertising emergency department (ED) wait times.

In vitro studies have revealed that ethanol seriously impairs the deformability of RBCs at concentrations far higher than those easily achievable in the blood after alcohol consumption. We examined the effect of ethanol on deformability at the physiologically achievable concentrations.\nContext 2: Ethanol exhibited a biphasic effect on the mechanically impaired filterability of human RBCs, that is, an improvement at concentrations from 0.02% to 0.2% (v/v) and a marked deterioration at 0.5% and higher. Without mechanical stress, ethanol decreased filterability at concentrations of 0.5% and higher. Ethanol increased the protein kinase A and protein kinase C activities of the mechanically stressed RBCs at concentrations of 0.02% and higher and those of the RBCs without mechanical stress at concentrations of 0.05% and higher.\nContext 3: Chronic ethanol treatment resulted in mild steatosis and necrosis, whereas chronic ethanol followed by binge group exhibited marked steatosis and significant increase in necrosis. Chronic binge group also showed significant increase (compared with chronic ethanol alone) in the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), ERK2, and RSK. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK did not increase by the binge. Ethanol binge, after chronic ethanol intake, caused increase in mRNA for egr-1 and PAI-1, but not TNF\u03b1.\nContext 4: The roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 isoforms (MEF2A, D) as mediators of the effects of ethanol on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression are unclear. We studied the effects of ethanol in adipocytes in vivo and in vitro.\nContext 5: The exposure to ethanol induced a reduction of cell viability, an alteration of cytoskeleton, a decrease in extracellular glutamate levels and an increase of reactive oxygen species production. The addiction of GET73 (1 and 10 \u00b5M) 1 h before and during chronic ethanol exposure prevented all the above ethanol-induced effects. Based on the proposed GET73 mechanism of action, the effects of mGlu5 receptor negative allosteric modulator, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), were studied in vitro. MPEP (10 \u00b5M) prevented the ethanol-induced reduction of cell viability, alteration of cytoskeleton, decrease in extracellular glutamate levels and increase of reactive oxygen species production. The effects of MPEP were blocked by the addition of the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, LY379268 (10 \u00b5M). The effects of MPEP were also blocked by the addition of the mGlu5 receptor antagonist, LY379268 (10 \u00b5M).

The effects of", "Contexts:\nContext 1: To evaluate the efficacy of 20 mg cisapride p.o. in reducing residual gastric volume and pH in adult ambulatory surgical patients.\nContext 2: Residual gastric volumes were similar in the two groups (19.5 +/- 23.8, 23.9 +/- 24.4 ml), in the cisapride and placebo groups respectively, P=0.24). Data shown are mean (+/- SD). The proportions of patients with a residual gastric volume exceeding 0.4 ml x kg(-1) were similar in the two groups (4 of 28, and 8 of 23 patients in the cisapride and placebo groups respectively, P=0.09). The pH of the residual gastric contents were similar in the cisapride and placebo groups (1.6 +/- 0.5, 1.4 +/- 0.5, respectively, P=0.26). The proportions of patients with pH < 2.5 was also similar in the cisapride and placebo groups (21 of 25, and 20 of 21 patients respectively, P=0.2).\nContext 3: Using a prospective randomised double-blind controlled design, we administered either 20 mg cisapride p.o. or placebo preoperatively to 64 ASA 1-2 ambulatory surgical patients. Following induction of anesthesia we measured volume and pH of residual gastric contents, using blind aspiration through an orogastric tube. Parametric data were analysed using unpaired, one tail Students' t test. Non-parametric data were analysed using Fishers Exact test and Chi square analysis. Statistical significance was accepted at the probability level of < 0.05.\nContext 4: We examined seven healthy males, mean age 22 years, who were treated with cisapride 10 mg t.i.d. and placebo during 3 days in a randomized order, with a 2-week time interval. Duodenojejunal manometry was performed after each treatment on the morning of day 3, using an 18-lumen catheter. A liquid nutrient (3 kcal/min) was administered intraduodenally for 30 min, followed by a bolus of the glucose analog 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG). Plasma 3-OMG concentrations were measured to assess absorption kinetics.\nContext 5: Thirteen normal, healthy adults were assigned to either a control group (n = 5) receiving no treatment or a cisapride group (n = 8) receiving 20 mg cisapride p.o. daily for 5 days. The cisapride group was then given 20 mg cisapride p.o. daily for 5 days. The control group was then given 20 mg cisapride p.o. daily for 5 days. The cisapride group was then given 20 mg cisapride p.o. daily for 5 days. The control group was then given 20 mg cisapride p.o. daily for 5 days. The cisapride group was then given 20 mg cisapride p.o. daily for 5 days. The control group was then given 20 mg cis"]
